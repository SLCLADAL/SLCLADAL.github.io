D01 0010  1    As a result, although we still make use of this distinction,
D01 0010 12    there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic
D01 0020 10    terms employed. Just what is meant by "spirit" and
D01 0030  6    by "matter"? The terms are generally taken for granted
D01 0040  4    as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements
D01 0050  2    in the common experience of all. Yet in the contemporary
D01 0060  1    context this is precisely what one must not do. For
D01 0060 11    in the modern world neither "spirit" nor "matter" refer
D01 0070  6    to any generally agreed-upon elements of experience.
D01 0080  4    We are in a transitional stage in which many of the
D01 0090  4    connotations of former usage have had to be revised
D01 0090 13    or rejected. When the words are used, we are never
D01 0100  9    sure which of the traditional meanings the user may
D01 0110  5    have in mind, or to what extent his revisions and rejections
D01 0120  3    of former understandings correspond to ours.
D01 0130  1       One of the most widespread features of contemporary
D01 0130  9    thought is the almost universal disbelief in the reality
D01 0140  7    of spirit. Just a few centuries ago the world of spirits
D01 0150  6    was as populous and real as the world of material entities.
D01 0160  3    Not only in popular thought but in that of the highly
D01 0170  1    educated as well was this true. Demons, fairies, angels,
D01 0170 10    and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a
D01 0180  9    part of the experiential world of western man as were
D01 0190  7    rocks and trees and stars. In such a world the words
D01 0200  3    "matter" and "spirit" both referred to directly known
D01 0210  2    realities in the common experience of all. In it important
D01 0210 12    elements of Christianity and of the Biblical view of
D01 0220  9    reality in general, which now cause us much difficulty,
D01 0230  7    could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously.
D01 0240  3       The progress of science over these last few centuries
D01 0250  3    and the gradual replacement of Biblical by scientific
D01 0260  1    categories of reality have to a large extent emptied
D01 0260 10    the spirit world of the entities which previously populated
D01 0270  7    it. In carrying out this program science has undoubtedly
D01 0280  5    performed a very considerable service for which it
D01 0290  4    can claim due credit. The objectification of the world
D01 0300  1    of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone
D01 0300  9    far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify
D01 0310  6    or support. Science is fully competent to deal with
D01 0320  4    any element of experience which arises from an object
D01 0330  1    in space and time. When, therefore, it turned its attention
D01 0330 11    to the concrete entities with which popular imagination
D01 0340  7    had peopled the world of spirit, these entities soon
D01 0350  6    lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements
D01 0360  4    of external reality. In doing so science has unquestionably
D01 0370  1    cleared up widespread misconceptions, removed extraneous
D01 0380  1    and illusory sources of fear, and dispelled many undesirable
D01 0380 10    popular superstitions. There have been, indeed, many
D01 0390  7    important and valuable gains from the development of
D01 0400  5    our present scientific view of the world for which
D01 0410  3    we may be rightly grateful.
D01 0410  8       All this has not, however, been an unmixed blessing.
D01 0420  5    The scientific debunking of the spirit world has been
D01 0430  3    in a way too successful and too thorough. The house
D01 0430 13    has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been
D01 0440 10    left with no means, or at best with wholly inadequate
D01 0450  7    means, for dealing with his experience of spirit. Although
D01 0460  4    the particular form of conceptualization which popular
D01 0470  2    imagination had made in response to the experience
D01 0470 10    of spirit was undoubtedly defective, the raw experience
D01 0480  7    itself which led to such excesses remains with us as
D01 0490  6    vividly as ever. We simply find ourselves in the position
D01 0500  4    of having no means for inquiring into the structure
D01 0510  1    and meaning of this range of our experience. There
D01 0510 10    is no framework or structure of thought with respect
D01 0520  7    to which we can organize it and no part of reality,
D01 0530  3    as we know and apprehend it, with respect to which
D01 0530 13    we can refer this experience. Science has simply left
D01 0540  9    us helpless and powerless in this important sector
D01 0550  5    of our lives.
D01 0550  8       The situation in which we find ourselves is brought
D01 0560  7    out with dramatic force in Arthur Miller's play The
D01 0570  4    Crucible, which deals with the Salem witch trials.
D01 0580  2    As the play opens the audience is introduced to the
D01 0580 12    community of Salem in Puritan America at the end of
D01 0590 10    the eighteenth century. Aside from a quaint concern
D01 0600  6    with witches and devils which provides the immediate
D01 0610  3    problem in the opening scene, it is a quite normal
D01 0610 13    community. The conversation of the characters creates
D01 0620  7    an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures,
D01 0630  6    foibles, irritations, and concerns which would characterize
D01 0640  4    the common life of a normal village in any age. There
D01 0650  3    is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these
D01 0650 13    people. Instead, the audience can sit back at ease
D01 0660  9    and, from the perspective of an enlightened time which
D01 0670  6    no longer believes in such things, enjoy the dead seriousness
D01 0680  5    with which the characters in the play take the witches
D01 0690  3    and devils which are under discussion. A teenage girl,
D01 0690 12    Abigail Williams, is being sharply questioned by her
D01 0700  8    minister uncle, the Reverend Samuel Parris, about a
D01 0710  7    wild night affair in the woods in which she and some
D01 0720  6    other girls had seemed to have had contact with these
D01 0730  2    evil beings. For all involved in this discussion the
D01 0730 11    devil is a real entity who can really be confronted
D01 0740  9    in the woods on a dark night, the demon world is populated
D01 0750  6    with real creatures, and witches actually can be seen
D01 0760  4    flying through the air.
D01 0760  8       As the play unfolds, however, the audience is subtly
D01 0770  5    brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows
D01 0780  3    with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the
D01 0780 11    community. Everyone in Salem, saint and sinner alike,
D01 0790  8    is swept up by it. It is like a mysterious epidemic
D01 0800  7    which, starting first with Abigail and Parris, spreads
D01 0810  4    inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through
D01 0820  1    the whole town until all have been infected by it.
D01 0820 11    It grows terribly and unavoidably in power and leaves
D01 0830  7    in its wake a trail of misery, moral disintegration,
D01 0840  3    and destruction. The audience leaves the play under
D01 0850  2    a spell, It is the kind of spell which the exposure
D01 0850 13    to spirit in its living active manifestation always
D01 0860  7    evokes.
D01 0860  8       If one asks about this play, what it is that comes
D01 0870  9    upon this community and works within it with such terrible
D01 0880  6    power, there is no better answer to give than "spirit".
D01 0890  3    This is not to attempt to say what spirit is, but only
D01 0900  2    to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply
D01 0900 12    identify a common experience. In the end the good man,
D01 0910  9    John Proctor, expresses what the audience has already
D01 0920  6    come to feel when he says, "A fire, a fire is burning!
D01 0930  5    I hear the boot of Lucifer, I see his filthy face"!
D01 0940  2    The tragic irony of the play is that the very belief
D01 0940 13    in and concern with a devil who could be met in the
D01 0950 11    woods and combatted with formulae set out in books
D01 0960  6    was the very thing that prevented them from detecting
D01 0970  2    the real devil when he came among them. We marvel at
D01 0970 13    their blindness for not seeing this. Yet are not we
D01 0980 10    of the mid-twentieth century, who rightly do not believe
D01 0990  7    there is any such "thing" as the devil, just as bad
D01 1000  5    off as they- only in a different way? In our disbelief
D01 1010  2    we think that we can no longer even use the word and
D01 1010 14    so are unable to even name the elemental power which
D01 1020  9    is so vividly real in this play. We are left helpless
D01 1030  7    to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it
D01 1040  4    as anything real for fear that to do so would imply
D01 1040 15    a commitment to that which has already been discredited
D01 1050  8    and proved false.
D01 1060  1       Even Mr& Miller himself seems uncertain on this
D01 1060  9    score. In a long commentary which he has inserted in
D01 1070  9    the published text of the first act of the play, he
D01 1080  7    says at one point: "However, that experience never
D01 1090  2    raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the
D01 1090 14    underworld or the existence of Lucifer's many-faced
D01 1100  8    lieutenants. And his belief is not to his discredit.
D01 1110  7    Better minds than Hale's were- and still are- convinced
D01 1120  5    that there is a society of spirits beyond our ken".
D01 1130  3    (page 33) On the other hand, a little later on he says:
D01 1140  1    "Since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped
D01 1140 10    out God's beard and the Devil's horns, but the world
D01 1150  9    is still gripped between two diametrically opposed
D01 1160  4    absolutes. The concept of unity, in which positive
D01 1170  2    and negative are attributes of the same force, in which
D01 1170 12    good and evil are relative, ever-changing, and always
D01 1180  9    joined to the same phenomenon- such a concept is still
D01 1190  8    reserved to the physical sciences and to the few who
D01 1200  6    have grasped the history of ideas **h. When we see
D01 1210  1    the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity
D01 1210  8    of the idea of man's worthlessness- until redeemed-
D01 1220  3    the necessity of the Devil may become evident as a
D01 1230  5    weapon, a weapon designed and used time and time again
D01 1240  2    in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular
D01 1240 14    church or church-state". (page 34)
D01 1250  6       Apparently he does not intend that those who read
D01 1260  5    or view this play should think of the devil as being
D01 1270  1    actually real. Yet such is the dramatic power of his
D01 1270 11    writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the
D01 1280  8    grip of the terrible power and potency of that which
D01 1290  5    came over Salem. It casts a spell upon them so that
D01 1300  3    they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious
D01 1300 14    presence of an evil power. It is not enough in accounting
D01 1310 11    for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness
D01 1320  7    of individual people added together to produce a cumulative
D01 1330  5    effect. For this does not account for the integral,
D01 1340  2    elemental power of that which grows with abounding
D01 1340 10    vigor as the play unfolds, nor does it explain the
D01 1350  9    strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over
D01 1360  4    those who watch the play like a spell. The reality
D01 1370  2    of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author's
D01 1370 13    convictions to the contrary.
D01 1380  4    #SPIRIT AND COMMUNITY#
D01 1380  7       There is nothing in the whole range of human experience
D01 1390  9    more widely known and universally felt than spirit.
D01 1400  5    Apart from spirit there could be no community, for
D01 1410  2    it is spirit which draws men into community and gives
D01 1410 12    to any community its unity, cohesiveness, and permanence.
D01 1420  7    Think, for example, of the spirit of the Marine Corps.
D01 1430  8    Surely this is a reality we all acknowledge. We cannot,
D01 1440  5    of course, assign it any substance. It is not material
D01 1450  4    and is not a "thing" occupying space and time. Yet
D01 1460  1    it exists and has an objective reality which can be
D01 1460 11    experienced and known. So it is too with many other
D01 1470  9    spirits which we all know: the spirit of Nazism or
D01 1480  5    Communism, school spirit, the spirit of a street corner
D01 1490  2    gang or a football team, the spirit of Rotary or the
D01 1490 13    Ku Klux Klan. Every community, if it is alive has a
D01 1500 10    spirit, and that spirit is the center of its unity
D01 1510  7    and identity.
D01 1510  9       In searching for clues which might lead us to a
D01 1520  7    fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit, the close
D01 1530  3    connection between spirit and community is likely to
D01 1530 11    prove the most fruitful. For it is primarily in community
D01 1540 10    that we know and experience spirit. It is spirit which
D01 1550  7    gives life to a community and causes it to cohere.
D01 1560  5    It is the spirit which is the source of a community's
D01 1570  1    drawing power by means of which others are drawn into
D01 1570 11    it from the world outside so that the community grows
D01 1580  9    and prospers. Yet the spirit which lives in community
D01 1590  6    is not identical with the community. The idea of community
D01 1600  5    and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable
D01 1610  1    ideas.
D01 1610  2       One characteristic of the spirit in community is
D01 1620  1    its givenness. The members of the community do not
D01 1620 10    create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting
D01 1630  8    for them. It is for them a given which they and they
D01 1640  5    alone possess. The spirit of the Marine Corps was present
D01 1650  3    and operative before any of the present members of
D01 1650 12    it came into it. It is they, of course, who keep it
D01 1660 11    alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue
D01 1670  7    to be present in the Corps for future recruits to find
D01 1680  4    as they come into it.
D02 0010  1    If the content of faith is to be presented today in
D02 0010 12    a form that can be "understanded of the people"- and
D02 0020  6    this, it must not be forgotten, is one of the goals
D02 0030  6    of the perennial theological task- there is no other
D02 0040  3    choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner
D02 0040 11    of representation.
D02 0050  1       This does not mean that mythological language as
D02 0060  1    such can no longer be used in theology and preaching.
D02 0060 11    The absurd notion that demythologization entails the
D02 0070  5    expurgation of all mythological concepts completely
D02 0080  3    misrepresents Bultmann's intention. His point is not
D02 0090  3    that mythology may not be used, but that it may no
D02 0090 14    longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate
D02 0100  9    conceptuality for expressing the Christian kerygma.
D02 0110  4    When we say that a mythological mode of thought must
D02 0120  4    be completely abandoned, we mean it must be abandoned
D02 0130  1    as the sole or proper means for presenting the Christian
D02 0130 11    understanding of existence. Mythological concepts may
D02 0140  6    by all means still be used, but they can be used responsibly
D02 0150  7    only as "symbols" or "ciphers", that is, only if they
D02 0160  6    are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological
D02 0170  1    (or existential) terms.
D02 0170  4       The statement is often made that when Bultmann argues
D02 0180  5    in this way, he "overestimates the intellectual stumbling-block
D02 0190  3    which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting
D02 0200  1    the Christian faith". But this statement is completely
D02 0200  9    unconvincing. If Bultmann's own definition of myth
D02 0210  7    is strictly adhered to (and it is interesting that
D02 0220  7    this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements),
D02 0230  4    the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all
D02 0240  4    exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts
D02 0240 12    of traditional theology have become incredible and
D02 0250  7    irrelevant. Nor is it necessary to look for such evidence
D02 0260  8    in the great urban centers of our culture that are
D02 0270  4    admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly
D02 0280  1    estranged from the conventional forms in which the
D02 0280  9    gospel has been communicated. On the contrary, even
D02 0290  6    in the heart of "the Bible belt" itself, as can be
D02 0300  6    attested by any one who is called to work there, the
D02 0310  2    industrial and technological revolutions have long
D02 0310  8    been under way, together with the corresponding changes
D02 0320  7    in man's picture of himself and his world.
D02 0330  4       In fact, it is in just such a situation that the
D02 0340  3    profundity of Bultmann's argument is disclosed. Although
D02 0350  1    the theological forms of the past continue to exist
D02 0350 10    in a way they do not in a more secularized situation,
D02 0360  7    the striking thing is the rapidity with which they
D02 0370  4    are being reduced to a marginal existence. This is
D02 0380  1    especially in evidence among the present generation
D02 0380  8    of the suburban middle class. Time and again in counseling
D02 0390  7    and teaching, one encounters members of this group
D02 0400  5    whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the
D02 0410  2    insubstantial mythologies of their "fundamentalist"
D02 0410  7    heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern world
D02 0420  9    are only too painfully obvious.
D02 0430  1       The same thing is also evidenced by the extreme
D02 0430 10    "culture-Protestantism" so often observed to characterize
D02 0440  6    the preaching and teaching of the American churches.
D02 0450  7    In the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in
D02 0460  3    which the gospel can be expressed, the unavoidable
D02 0470  1    need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources
D02 0470 10    are at hand- and this usually means one or another
D02 0480  8    of the various forms of "folk religion" current in
D02 0490  5    the situation. This is not to say that the only explanation
D02 0500  4    of the present infatuation with Norman Vincent Peale's
D02 0510  2    "cult of reassurance" or the other types of a purely
D02 0520  1    cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for
D02 0520  9    a demythologized gospel. But it is to say that this
D02 0530  9    need is far more important for such infatuation than
D02 0540  3    most of the pundits seem to have suspected.
D02 0550  1       However, even if the latent demand for demythologization
D02 0550  9    is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming, at
D02 0560  8    least among the cultured elements of the population
D02 0570  4    there tends to be an almost complete indifference to
D02 0580  2    the church and its traditional message of sin and grace.
D02 0580 12    To be sure, when this is pointed out, a common response
D02 0590 10    among certain churchmen is to fulminate about "the
D02 0600  6    little flock" and "the great crowd" and to take solace
D02 0610  5    from Paul's castigation of the "wisdom of the wise"
D02 0620  3    in the opening chapter of First Corinthians. But can
D02 0630  1    we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation?
D02 0630 11    Can the church risk assuming that the "folly" of men
D02 0640  8    is as dear to God as their "wisdom", or, as is also
D02 0650  6    commonly implied, that "the foolishness of God" and
D02 0660  4    "the foolishness of men" are simply two ways of talking
D02 0670  3    about the same thing? Can we continue to alienate precisely
D02 0680  1    those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart
D02 0680 10    from whose co-operation our mission in the world must
D02 0690  7    become increasingly precarious?
D02 0700  1       There is an ancient and venerable tradition in the
D02 0700 10    church (which derives, however, from the heritage of
D02 0710  7    the Greeks rather than from the Bible) that God is
D02 0720  6    completely independent of his creation and so has no
D02 0730  4    need of men for accomplishing his work in the world.
D02 0730 14    by analogy, the church also has been regarded as entirely
D02 0740  9    independent of the "world" in the sense of requiring
D02 0750  7    nothing from it in order to be the church. But, as
D02 0760  5    Scripture everywhere reminds us, God does have need
D02 0770  3    of his creatures, and the church, a fortiori, can ill
D02 0770 13    afford to do without the talents with which the world,
D02 0780 10    by God's providence, presents it.
D02 0790  3       And yet this is exactly the risk we run when we
D02 0800  2    assume, as we too often do, that we can continue to
D02 0800 13    preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible
D02 0810  9    and irrelevant to cultured men. Until we translate
D02 0820  5    this gospel into a language that enlightened men today
D02 0830  3    can understand, we are depriving ourselves of the very
D02 0830 12    resources on which the continued success of our witness
D02 0840  9    most certainly depends.
D02 0850  1       In arguing in this way, we are obviously taking
D02 0850 10    for granted that a demythologized restatement of the
D02 0860  7    kerygma can be achieved; and that we firmly believe
D02 0870  6    this will presently become evident when we set forth
D02 0880  4    reasons to justify such a conviction. But the main
D02 0880 13    point here is that even if such a restatement were
D02 0890 10    not possible, the demand to demythologize the kerygma
D02 0900  6    would still be unavoidable.
D02 0910  1       This is what we mean when we say this demand must
D02 0910 11    be accepted without condition. If to be a Christian
D02 0920  7    means to say yes where I otherwise say no, or where
D02 0930  5    I do not have the right to say anything at all, then
D02 0940  1    my only choice is to refuse to be a Christian. Expressed
D02 0940 12    differently: if the price for becoming a faithful follower
D02 0950  9    of Jesus Christ is some form of self-destruction, whether
D02 0960  8    of the body or of the mind- sacrificium corporis, sacrificium
D02 0970  6    intellectus- then there is no alternative but that
D02 0980  5    the price remain unpaid.
D02 0980  9       This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential
D02 0990  7    to the argument of this concluding chapter. Modern
D02 1000  3    man, as Dietrich Bonhoeffer has told us, has "come
D02 1010  2    of age"; and though this process by no means represents
D02 1020  1    an unambiguous gain and is, in fact, marked by the
D02 1020 11    estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost
D02 1030  9    of human maturation, it is still a positive step forward;
D02 1040  5    and those of us who so richly benefit from it should
D02 1050  3    be the last to despise it. In any event, it is an irreversible
D02 1060  1    step, and if we are at all honest with ourselves, we
D02 1060 12    will know we have no other alternative than to live
D02 1070  8    in the world in which God has seen fit to place us.
D02 1080  6       To say this, of course, is to take up a position
D02 1090  2    on one side of a controversy going on now for some
D02 1090 13    two hundred years, or, at any rate, since the beginning
D02 1100  9    of the distinctively modern period in theological thought.
D02 1110  5    We have aligned ourselves with that "liberal" tradition
D02 1120  3    in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great
D02 1130  3    names in its history those of Schleiermacher, Ritschl,
D02 1140  1    Herrmann, Harnack, and Troeltsch, and more recently,
D02 1140  8    Schweitzer and the early Barth and, in part at least,
D02 1150  9    Bultmann. It is to this same tradition that most of
D02 1160  5    the creative figures in the last century and a half
D02 1170  3    of American theology also belong. For we must number
D02 1170 12    here not only the names of Bushnell, Clarke, and Rauschenbusch,
D02 1180  9    not to mention those of "the Chicago School" and Macintosh,
D02 1190  8    but those of the brothers Niebuhr and (if America may
D02 1200  8    claim him!) Tillich as well. Finally, we may also mention
D02 1210  7    the several members of the self-consciously "neoliberal"
D02 1220  2    movement that developed at the University of Chicago
D02 1230  3    and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative
D02 1230 11    work of Alfred North Whitehead.
D02 1240  5       What makes this long and diverse tradition essentially
D02 1250  3    one is that those who have belonged to it have been
D02 1260  3    profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively
D02 1270  1    modern world. Although they have also been concerned
D02 1270  9    to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic
D02 1280  7    church, they have exhibited no willingness whatever
D02 1290  4    to sacrifice their modernity to their Christianity.
D02 1300  1    They have insisted, rather, on living fully and completely
D02 1310  1    within modern culture and, so far from considering
D02 1310  9    this treason to God, have looked upon it as the only
D02 1320  8    way they could be faithful to him.
D02 1330  1       When we say, then, that today, in our situation,
D02 1330 10    the demand for demythologization must be accepted without
D02 1340  6    condition, we are simply saying that at least this
D02 1350  6    much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement.
D02 1360  2    However much we may have to criticize liberal theology's
D02 1370  1    constructive formulations, the theology we ourselves
D02 1370  7    must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism,
D02 1380  8    not behind it.
D02 1390  1       In affirming this we have already taken the decisive
D02 1390 10    step in breaking the deadlock into which Bultmann's
D02 1400  6    attempt to formulate such a theology has led. For we
D02 1410  6    have said, in effect, that of the two alternatives
D02 1420  1    to his position variously represented by the other
D02 1420  9    participants in the demythologizing discussion, only
D02 1430  6    one is really an alternative. If the demand for demythologization
D02 1440  6    is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology
D02 1460  3    unconditionally, the position of the "right" is clearly
D02 1470  2    untenable. Whereas Bultmann's "center" position is
D02 1470  8    structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible
D02 1480  6    on formal grounds alone, the general position of the
D02 1490  7    "right", as represented, say, by Karl Barth, involves
D02 1500  5    the rejection or at least qualification of the demand
D02 1510  3    for demythologization and so is invalidated on the
D02 1510 11    material grounds we have just considered.
D02 1520  6       It follows, then, provided the possibilities have
D02 1530  4    been exhausted, that the only real alternative is the
D02 1540  3    general viewpoint of the "left", which has been represented
D02 1550  1    on the Continent by Fritz Buri and, to some extent
D02 1550 11    at least, is found in much that is significant in American
D02 1560 10    and English theology.
D02 1570  1       In order to make the implications of our position
D02 1570 10    as clear as possible, we may develop this argument
D02 1580  8    at greater length.
D02 1580 11       We may show, first, that there cannot possibly be
D02 1590  9    an alternative other than the three typically represented
D02 1600  6    by Bultmann, Barth, and Buri. To do this, it is sufficient
D02 1610  7    to point out that if the principle in terms of which
D02 1620  3    alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude
D02 1620 13    more than two, then the question of a "third" possibility
D02 1630 10    is a meaningless question. Thus, if what is at issue
D02 1640  8    is whether "All ~S is ~P", it is indifferent whether
D02 1650  7    "Some ~S is not ~P" or "No ~S is ~P", since in either
D02 1660  9    case the judgment in question is false. Hence, if what
D02 1670  6    is in question is whether in a given theology myth
D02 1680  2    is or is not completely rejected, it is unimportant
D02 1680 11    whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable
D02 1690 10    quantity is accepted; for, in either event, the first
D02 1700  7    possibility is excluded. Therefore, the only conceivable
D02 1710  4    alternatives are those represented, on the one hand,
D02 1720  1    by the two at least apparently self-consistent but
D02 1720 10    mutually exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and,
D02 1730  7    on the other hand, by the third but really pseudo position
D02 1740  5    (analogous to a round square) of Bultmann.
D02 1750  1       A second point requires more extended comment. It
D02 1750  9    will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that
D02 1760  8    the position of the "right", as represented by Barth,
D02 1770  5    rests on the following thesis: The only tenable alternative
D02 1780  4    to Bultmann's position is a theology that (1) rejects
D02 1790  3    or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for
D02 1790 11    demythologization and existential interpretation; (2)
D02 1800  5    accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or
D02 1810  5    method of interpretation; and (3) in so doing, frees
D02 1820  5    itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus
D02 1830  1    Christ by means of statements that, from Bultmann's
D02 1830  9    point of view, are mythological.
D03 0010  1       ONE HUNDRED years ago there existed in England the
D03 0010 10    Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom.
D03 0020  9    Representing as it did the efforts of only unauthorized
D03 0030  9    individuals of the Roman and Anglican Churches, and
D03 0040  5    urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to Rome,
D03 0050  3    this association produced little fruit, and, in fact,
D03 0050 11    was condemned by the Holy Office in 1864.
D03 0060  8       Now again in 1961, in England, there is perhaps
D03 0070  5    nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed
D03 0080  2    as Christian unity. The Church Unity Octave, January
D03 0090  1    18-25, was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion
D03 0090 10    by the various churches. Many people seem hopeful,
D03 0100  6    yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there
D03 0110  5    will be any more real attainment of Christian unity
D03 0120  2    in 1961 than there was in 1861. But it must be readily
D03 0120 14    seen that the religious picture in England has so greatly
D03 0130 10    changed during these hundred years as to engender hope,
D03 0140  7    at least on the Catholic side. For the "tide is well
D03 0150  6    on the turn", as the London Catholic weekly Universe
D03 0160  2    has written.
D03 0160  4       I came to England last summer to do research on
D03 0170  4    the unpublished letters of Cardinal Newman. As an American
D03 0180  2    Catholic of Irish ancestry, I came with certain preconceptions
D03 0190  1    and expectations; being intellectually influenced by
D03 0190  7    Newman and the general 19th-century literature of England,
D03 0200  9    I knew only a Protestant-dominated country. Since arriving
D03 0210  4    here, however, I have formed a far different religious
D03 0220  5    picture of present-day England. In representing part
D03 0230  2    of this new picture, I will be recounting some of my
D03 0240  1    own personal experiences, reactions and judgments;
D03 0240  7    but my primary aim is to transcribe what Englishmen
D03 0250  6    themselves are saying and writing and implying about
D03 0260  4    the Roman and Anglican Churches and about the present
D03 0261  2    religious state of England.
D03 0270  4       Since the Protestant clergy for the most part wear
D03 0280  4    gray or some variant from the wholly black suit, my
D03 0280 14    Roman collar and black garb usually identify me in
D03 0290  9    England as a Roman Catholic cleric. In any case, I
D03 0300  7    have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by
D03 0310  4    Englishmen, even in Devonshire and Cornwall, where
D03 0320  1    anti-Catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest
D03 0320  9    and longest.
D03 0330  1       Nowhere have I seen public expression of anti-Catholicism.
D03 0340  1    On my first Guy Fawkes Day here, I found Catholics
D03 0340 11    as well as non-Catholics celebrating with the traditional
D03 0350  8    fireworks and bonfires, and was told that most Englishmen
D03 0360  7    either do not know or are not concerned with the historical
D03 0370  5    significance of the day. A Birmingham newspaper printed
D03 0380  3    in a column for children an article entitled "The True
D03 0390  2    Story of Guy Fawkes", which began:
D03 0390  8       "When you pile your "guy" on the bonfire tomorrow
D03 0410  6    night, I wonder how much of the true story of Guy Fawkes
D03 0420  6    you will remember? In the 355 years since the first
D03 0430  3    Guy Fawkes Night, much of the story has been forgotten,
D03 0440  1    so here is a reminder". The article proceeded to give
D03 0440 11    an inaccurate account of a catholic plot to kill King
D03 0450  9    James /1,.
D03 0450 11    ##
D03 0450 12    IN SPITE OF the increase in numbers and prestige brought
D03 0460 10    about by the conversions of Newman and other Tractarians
D03 0470  7    of the 1840's and 1850's, the Catholic segment of England
D03 0480  6    one hundred years ago was a very small one (four per
D03 0490  5    cent, or 800,000) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing
D03 0500  2    from the general public. The return of the Catholic
D03 0500 11    hierarchy in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation
D03 0510  9    and, in fact, was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty.
D03 0520  9    In 1864 Newman professedly had to write his Apologia
D03 0530  6    with his keenest feelings in order to be believed and
D03 0540  6    to command a fair hearing from English readers.
D03 0560  1       Now, in 1961, the Catholic population of England
D03 0560  9    is still quite small (ten per cent, or 5 million);
D03 0570  9    yet it represents a very considerable percentage of
D03 0580  4    the churchgoing population. A Protestant woman marveled
D03 0590  3    to me over the large crowds going in and out of the
D03 0590 15    Birmingham Oratory (Catholic) Church on Sunday mornings.
D03 0600  7    She found this a marvel because, as she said, only
D03 0610  9    six per cent of English people are churchgoers. She
D03 0620  4    may not have been exact on this number, but others
D03 0630  2    here feel quite certain that the percentage would be
D03 0630 11    less than ten. From many sides come remarks that Protestant
D03 0640  9    churches are badly attended and the large medieval
D03 0650  6    cathedrals look all but empty during services. A Catholic
D03 0660  4    priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large
D03 0670  3    city university, following Anglican evensong, at which
D03 0670 10    there was a congregation of twelve, he celebrated Mass
D03 0680  9    before more than a hundred.
D03 0690  2       The Protestants themselves are the first to admit
D03 0690 10    the great falling off in effective membership in their
D03 0700  9    churches. According to a newspaper report of the 1961
D03 0710  8    statistics of the Church of England, the "total of
D03 0720  4    confirmed members is 9,748,000, but only 2,887,671
D03 0730  1    are registered on the parochial church rolls", and
D03 0730  9    "over 27 million people in England are baptized into
D03 0740  7    the Church of England, but roughly only a tenth of
D03 0750  6    them continue". An amazing article in the Manchester
D03 0760  2    Guardian of last November, entitled "Fate of Redundant
D03 0770  1    Churches", states than an Archbishops' Commission "reported
D03 0780  1    last month that in the Church of England alone there
D03 0780 11    are 790 churches which are redundant now, or will be
D03 0790  9    in 20 years' time. A further 260 Anglican churches
D03 0800  4    have been demolished since 1948". And in the last five
D03 0810  5    years, the "Methodist chapel committee has authorized
D03 0820  1    the demolition or, more often, the sale of 764 chapels".
D03 0820 11    Most of these former churches are now used as warehouses,
D03 0830  9    but "neither Anglicans nor Nonconformists object to
D03 0840  4    selling churches to Roman Catholics", and have done
D03 0850  4    so.
D03 0850  5       While it must be said that these same Protestants
D03 0860  2    have built some new churches during this period, and
D03 0860 11    that religious population shifts have emptied churches,
D03 0870  7    a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy
D03 0880  6    is that fewer Protestants are going to church. It should
D03 0890  6    be admitted, too, that there is a good percentage of
D03 0900  3    lapsed or nonchurchgoing Catholics (one paper writes
D03 0900 10    50 per cent). Still, it is clear from such reports,
D03 0910 10    and apparently clear from the remarks of many people,
D03 0920  7    that Protestants are decreasing and Catholics increasing.
D03 0930  3       An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly
D03 0940  3    acknowledged to me that this is true. A century ago,
D03 0950  1    Newman saw that liberalism (what we now might call
D03 0950 10    secularism) would gradually but definitely make its
D03 0960  6    mark on English Protestantism, and that even high Anglicanism
D03 0970  5    would someday no longer be a "serviceable breakwater
D03 0980  2    against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its
D03 0980  9    own". That day is perhaps today, 1961, and it seems
D03 0990 10    no longer very meaningful to call England a "Protestant
D03 1000  6    country". One of the ironies of the present crusade
D03 1010  5    for Christian unity is that there are not, relatively
D03 1020  1    speaking, many real Christians to unite.
D03 1020  7       Many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism
D03 1030  7    and know that they are in a new ascendancy. The London
D03 1040  7    Universe devoted its centenary issue last December
D03 1050  3    8 to mapping out various aspects of Catholic progress
D03 1060  1    during the last one hundred years. With traditional
D03 1060  9    nationalistic spirit, some Englishmen claim that English
D03 1070  6    Catholicism is Catholicism at its best. I have found
D03 1080  7    myself saying with other foreigners here that English
D03 1090  3    Catholics are good Catholics. It has been my experience
D03 1100  1    to find as many men as women in church, and to hear
D03 1100 13    almost everyone in church congregations reciting the
D03 1110  6    Latin prayers and responses at Mass.
D03 1120  3       They hope, of course, to reclaim the non-Catholic
D03 1130  1    population to the Catholic faith, and at every Sunday
D03 1130 10    Benediction they recite by heart the "Prayer for England":
D03 1140  9       "O Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God and our most
D03 1150  9    gentle queen and mother, look down in mercy upon England,
D03 1160  7    thy "dowry", and upon us all who greatly hope and trust
D03 1170  7    in thee **h. Intercede for our separated brethren,
D03 1180  2    that with us in the one true fold they may be united
D03 1180 14    to the chief Shepherd, the vicar of thy Son **h". A
D03 1190 10    hymn often to be heard in Catholic churches is "Faith
D03 1200  7    of our Fathers", which glories in England's ancient
D03 1210  4    faith that endured persecution, and which proclaims:
D03 1220  2    "Faith of our Fathers: Mary's prayers/Shall win our
D03 1230  2    country back to thee". The English saints are widely
D03 1230 11    venerated, quite naturally, and now there is great
D03 1240  8    hope that the Forty Martyrs and Cardinal Newman will
D03 1250  5    soon be canonized.
D03 1250  8       Because they have kept the faith of their medieval
D03 1260  8    fathers, English Catholics have always strongly resented
D03 1270  4    the charge of being "un-English". I have not seen this
D03 1280  5    charge made during my stay here, but apparently it
D03 1290  1    is still in the air. For example, a writer in a recent
D03 1290 13    number of The Queen hyperbolically states that "of
D03 1300  6    the myriad imprecations the only one which the English
D03 1310  6    Catholics really resent is the suggestion that they
D03 1320  3    are 'un-English'". In this connection, it has been
D03 1330  1    observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics,
D03 1330  9    priests and laity, in England, while certainly seen
D03 1340  7    as good for Catholicism, is nevertheless a source of
D03 1350  6    embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic English
D03 1360  2    Catholics, especially when these Irishmen offer to
D03 1360  9    remind their Christian brethren of this good.
D03 1370  7    ##
D03 1370  8    ONE OF THE more noteworthy changes that have taken
D03 1380  7    place since the mid-19th century is the situation of
D03 1390  5    Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge Universities. At
D03 1400  2    Oxford one hundred years ago there were very few Catholics,
D03 1410  1    partly because religious tests were removed only in
D03 1410  9    1854. Moreover, for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical
D03 1420  9    representation in the city to care for their religious
D03 1430  7    needs. Now, not only are there considerably more laity
D03 1440  3    as students and professors at Oxford, but there are
D03 1450  2    also numerous houses of religious orders existing in
D03 1450 10    respectable and friendly relations with the non-Catholic
D03 1460  8    members of the University. Some Catholic priests lecture
D03 1470  5    there; Catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row
D03 1480  4    on the Cherwell with non-Catholic students.
D03 1490  1       Further evidence that Roman Catholicism enjoys a
D03 1490  8    more favorable position today than in 1861 is the respectful
D03 1500  9    attention given to it in the mass media of England.
D03 1510  7    The general tone of articles appearing in such important
D03 1520  4    newspapers as the Manchester Guardian and the Sunday
D03 1530  2    Observer implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic
D03 1540  1    Church is now at least of equal stature in England
D03 1540 11    with the Protestant churches. On successive Sundays
D03 1550  5    during October, 1960, Paul Ferris (a non-Catholic)
D03 1560  4    wrote articles in the Observer depicting clergymen
D03 1570  2    of the Church of England, the Church of Rome and the
D03 1570 13    Nonconformist Church. The Catholic priest, though somewhat
D03 1580  7    superficially drawn, easily came out the best. There
D03 1590  8    were many letters of strong protest against the portrait
D03 1600  5    of the Anglican clergyman, who was indeed portrayed
D03 1610  2    as a man not particularly concerned with religious
D03 1610 10    matters and without really very much to do as clergyman.
D03 1620 10    Such a series of articles was certainly never printed
D03 1630  6    in the public press of mid-Victorian England. There
D03 1640  3    was so much interest shown in this present-day venture
D03 1650  2    that it was continued on B&B&C&, where comments were
D03 1660  1    equally made by an Anglican parson, a Free Church minister
D03 1660 11    and a Catholic priest.
D03 1670  2       Catholic priests have frequently appeared on television
D03 1680  2    programs, sometimes discussing the Christian faith
D03 1680  8    on an equal footing with Protestant clergymen. A notable
D03 1690  7    example of this was the discussion of Christian unity
D03 1700  6    by the Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool, Dr& Heenan,
D03 1710  3    and the Anglican Archbishop of York, Dr& Ramsey, recently
D03 1720  3    appointed Archbishop of Canterbury. The good feeling
D03 1730  2    which exists between these two important church figures
D03 1730 10    is now well known in England. The Holy Sacrifice of
D03 1740  9    the Mass with commentary has been televised several
D03 1750  5    times in recent months. And it was interesting to observe
D03 1760  4    that B&B&C&'s television film on Christmas Eve was
D03 1770  3    The Bells of St& Mary's.
D03 1770  8       Of course, the crowning event that has dramatically
D03 1780  7    upset the traditional pattern of English religious
D03 1790  4    history was the friendly visit paid by Dr& Fisher,
D03 1800  2    then Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, to the Vatican
D03 1810  1    last December. It was the first time an English Primate
D03 1810 11    has done this since the 14th century. English Catholics
D03 1820  8    reacted to this event with moderate but real hope.
D03 1830  6       Almost daily something is reported which feeds this
D03 1840  4    Catholic hope in England: statistics of the increasing
D03 1850  1    numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants;
D03 1850  8    news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has
D03 1860  8    offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his
D03 1870  6    pulpit; a report that a Catholic nun had been requested
D03 1880  4    to teach in a non-Catholic secondary school during
D03 1890  1    the sickness of one of its masters; the startling statement
D03 1890 11    in a respectable periodical that "Catholics, if the
D03 1900  7    present system is still in operation, will constitute
D03 1910  5    almost one-third of the House of Lords in the next
D03 1920  4    generation"; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen
D03 1930  1    and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian
D03 1930 10    unity at a Catholic church in Slough during the Church
D03 1940  9    Unity Octave.
D04 0010  1    The death of a man is unique, and yet it is universal.
D04 0010 13    The straight line would symbolize its uniqueness, the
D04 0020  7    circle its universality. But how can one figure symbolize
D04 0030  6    both?
D04 0030  7       Christianity declares that in the life and death
D04 0040  6    of Jesus Christ the unique and the universal concur.
D04 0050  2    Perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the
D04 0050 11    unique and the universal as clearly, or formulated
D04 0060  8    it as precisely, as Irenaeus. To be the Savior and
D04 0070  6    the Lord, Jesus Christ has to be a historical individual
D04 0080  2    with a biography all his own; he dare not be a cosmic
D04 0090  1    aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies
D04 0090 12    itself with man's history. Yet this utterly individual
D04 0100  8    historical person must also contain within himself
D04 0110  6    the common history of mankind. His history is his alone,
D04 0120  5    yet each man must recognize his own history in it.
D04 0130  2    His death is his alone, yet each man can see his own
D04 0130 14    death in the crucifixion of Jesus. Each man can identify
D04 0140  8    himself with the history and the death of Jesus Christ
D04 0150  7    because Jesus Christ has identified himself with human
D04 0160  4    history and human death, coming as the head of a new
D04 0170  2    humanity. Not a circle, then, nor a straight line,
D04 0170 11    but a spiral represents the shape of death as Irenaeus
D04 0180  8    sees it; for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence.
D04 0190  6    As represented by a spiral, history may, in some sense,
D04 0200  4    be said to repeat itself; yet each historical event
D04 0210  1    remains unique. Christ is both unique and universal.
D04 0210  9       The first turn of the spiral is the primeval history
D04 0220  9    of humanity in Adam. As Origen interprets the end of
D04 0230  6    history on the basis of its beginning, so Irenaeus
D04 0240  3    portrays the story of Adam on the basis of the story
D04 0240 14    of Christ. "Whence, then, comes the substance of the
D04 0250  9    first man? From God's Will and Wisdom, and from virgin
D04 0260  8    earth. For 'God had not rained', says the Scripture,
D04 0270  6    before man was made, 'and there was no man to till
D04 0280  6    the earth'. From this earth, then, while it was still
D04 0290  2    virgin God took dust and fashioned the man, the beginning
D04 0290 12    of humanity". Irenaeus does not regard Adam and Eve
D04 0300  8    merely as private individuals, but as universal human
D04 0310  6    beings, who were and are all of humanity. Adam and
D04 0320  3    Eve were perfect, not in the sense that they possessed
D04 0330  1    perfection, but in the sense that they were capable
D04 0330 10    of development toward perfection. They were, in fact,
D04 0340  7    children. Irenaeus does not claim pre-existence for
D04 0350  5    the human soul; therefore there is no need for him,
D04 0360  2    as there is for Origen, to identify existence itself
D04 0360 11    with the fall. Existence is created and willed by God
D04 0370  9    and is not the consequence of a pre-existent rebellion
D04 0380  6    or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history.
D04 0390  3    Historical existence is a created good.
D04 0390  9       The biblical symbol for this affirmation is expressed
D04 0400  7    in the words: "So God created man in his own image;
D04 0410  8    in the similitude of God he created him". There are
D04 0420  4    some passages in the writings of Irenaeus where the
D04 0430  2    image of God and the similitude are sharply distinguished,
D04 0430 11    so most notably in the statement: "If the [Holy] Spirit
D04 0440 10    is absent from the soul, such a man is indeed of an
D04 0450 11    animal nature; and, being left carnal, he will be an
D04 0460  7    imperfect being, possessing the image [of God] in his
D04 0470  4    formation, but not receiving the similitude [of God]
D04 0480  1    through the Spirit". Thus the image of God is that
D04 0480 11    which makes a man a man and not an oyster; the similitude
D04 0490 11    of God, by contrast, is that which makes a man a child
D04 0500  9    of God and not merely a rational creature. Recent research
D04 0510  3    on Irenaeus, however, makes it evident that he does
D04 0520  3    not consistently maintain this distinction. He does
D04 0520 10    not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God
D04 0530 10    and his immortality through the fall; for he was created
D04 0540  7    not exactly immortal, nor yet exactly mortal, but capable
D04 0550  4    of immortality as well as of mortality.
D04 0560  1       Therefore Irenaeus describes man's creation as follows:
D04 0570  1       "So that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur,
D04 0570 11    and become lifted up, as if he had no lord, because
D04 0580  9    of the dominion that had been given to him, and the
D04 0590  6    freedom, fall into sin against God his Creator, overstepping
D04 0600  2    his bounds, and take up an attitude of self-conceited
D04 0600 12    arrogance towards God, a law was given him by God,
D04 0610 10    that he might know that he had for lord the lord of
D04 0620  9    all. And He laid down for him certain conditions: so
D04 0630  3    that, if he kept the command of God, then he would
D04 0640  1    always remain as he was, that is, immortal; but if
D04 0640 11    he did not, he would become mortal, melting into earth,
D04 0650  7    whence his frame had been taken". These conditions
D04 0660  3    man did not keep, and thus he became mortal; yet he
D04 0670  3    did not stop being human as a result. There is no justification
D04 0680  1    for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus
D04 0680  8    about the image of God beyond this, nor for reading
D04 0690  8    into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction
D04 0700  4    between the image of God (humanity) and the similitude
D04 0710  3    of God (immortality).
D04 0710  6       Man was created with the capacity for immortality,
D04 0720  4    but the devil's promise of immortality in exchange
D04 0730  3    for disobedience cost Adam his immortality. He was,
D04 0730 11    in the words of Irenaeus, "beguiled by another under
D04 0740  8    the pretext of immortality". The true way to immortality
D04 0750  6    lay through obedience, but man did not believe this.
D04 0760  5       "Eve was disobedient; for she did not obey when
D04 0770  4    as yet she was a virgin. And even as she, having indeed
D04 0780  1    a husband, Adam, but being nevertheless as yet a virgin
D04 0780 11    **h, having become disobedient, was made the cause
D04 0790  7    of death, both to herself and to the entire human race;
D04 0800  6    so also did Mary, having a man betrothed [to her],
D04 0810  3    and being nevertheless a virgin, by yielding obedience,
D04 0810 11    become the cause of salvation, both to herself and
D04 0820  9    the whole human race". Because he interprets the primitive
D04 0830  6    state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity
D04 0840  4    and believes that Adam and Eve were created as children,
D04 0850  3    Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience
D04 0860  1    as being "due, no doubt, to carelessness, but still
D04 0860 10    wicked". His interpretation of the beginning on the
D04 0870  8    basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels
D04 0880  6    between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin Mary. That parallelism
D04 0890  4    affects his picture of man's disobedience too; for
D04 0900  2    as it was Christ, the Word of God, who came to rescue
D04 0900 14    man, so it was disobedience to the word of God in the
D04 0910 12    beginning that brought death into the world, and all
D04 0920  7    our woe.
D04 0920  9       With this act of disobedience, and not with the
D04 0930  5    inception of his individual existence, man began the
D04 0940  3    downward circuit on the spiral of history, descending
D04 0940 11    from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable
D04 0950  9    mortality. At the nadir of that circuit is death. "Along
D04 0960  9    with the fruit they did also fall under the power of
D04 0970  7    death, because they did eat in disobedience; and disobedience
D04 0980  3    to God entails death. Wherefore, as they became forfeit
D04 0990  2    to death, from that [moment] they were handed over
D04 0990 11    to it". This leads Irenaeus to the somewhat startling
D04 1000  8    notion that Adam and Eve died on the same day that
D04 1010  9    they disobeyed, namely, on a Friday, as a parallel
D04 1020  4    to the death of Christ on Good Friday; he sees a parallel
D04 1030  3    also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath.
D04 1030 13    In any case, though they had been promised immortality
D04 1040  9    if they ate of the tree, they obtained mortality instead.
D04 1050  7    The wages of sin is death. Man's life, originally shaped
D04 1060  5    for immortality and for communion with God, must now
D04 1070  4    be conformed to the shape of death.
D04 1070 11       Nevertheless, even at the nadir of the circuit the
D04 1080  9    spiral of history belongs to God, and he still rules.
D04 1090  7    Even death, therefore, has a providential as well as
D04 1100  4    a punitive function.
D04 1100  7       "Wherefore also He [God] drove him [man] out of
D04 1110  6    Paradise, and removed him far from the tree of life,
D04 1120  3    not because He envied him the tree of life, as some
D04 1120 14    venture to assert, but because He pitied him, [and
D04 1130  9    did not desire] that he should continue a sinner for
D04 1140  7    ever, nor that the sin which surrounded him should
D04 1150  3    be immortal, and evil interminable and irremediable.
D04 1150 10    But He set a bound to his [state of] sin, by interposing
D04 1160 12    death, and thus causing sin to cease, putting an end
D04 1170  8    to it by the dissolution of the flesh, which should
D04 1180  4    take place in the earth, so that man, ceasing at length
D04 1190  2    to live in sin, and dying to it, might live to God".
D04 1190 14    This idea, which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian,
D04 1200  9    fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus' theology;
D04 1210  7    for it prepares the way for the passage from life through
D04 1220  6    death to life that is achieved in Christ. As man can
D04 1230  4    live only by dying, so it was only by his dying that
D04 1240  1    Christ could bring many to life.
D04 1240  7       It is probably fair to say that the idea of death
D04 1250  6    is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of sin is.
D04 1260  3    This applies to his picture of Adam. It is borne out
D04 1260 14    also by the absence of any developed theory about how
D04 1270 10    sin passes from one generation to the next. It becomes
D04 1280  6    most evident in his description of Christ as the second
D04 1290  5    Adam, who does indeed come to destroy sin, but whose
D04 1300  2    work culminates in the achievement of immortality.
D04 1300  9    This emphasis upon death rather than sin as man's fundamental
D04 1310  9    problem Irenaeus shares with many early theologians,
D04 1320  6    especially the Greek-speaking ones. They speak of the
D04 1330  5    work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility,
D04 1340  1    which can mean (though it does not have to mean) deliverance
D04 1340 12    from time and history.
D04 1350  4       Death reminds man of his sin, but it reminds him
D04 1360  2    also of his transience. It represents a punishment
D04 1360 10    that he knows he deserves, but it also symbolizes most
D04 1370  8    dramatically that he lives his life within the process
D04 1380  6    of time. These two aspects of death cannot be successfully
D04 1390  3    separated, but they dare not be confused or identified.
D04 1400  1    The repeated efforts in Christian history to describe
D04 1400  9    death as altogether the consequence of human sin show
D04 1410  8    that these two aspects of death cannot be separated.
D04 1420  5    Such efforts almost always find themselves compelled
D04 1430  2    to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing
D04 1430 11    old and then older and then still older, in short,
D04 1440  9    whether Adam's life was intended to be part of the
D04 1450  7    process of time. If it was, then it must have been
D04 1460  3    God's intention to translate him at a certain point
D04 1460 12    from time to eternity. One night, so some of these
D04 1470 10    theories run, Adam would have fallen asleep, much as
D04 1480  6    he fell asleep for the creation of Eve; and thus he
D04 1490  4    would have been carried over into the life eternal.
D04 1490 13    The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness
D04 1500  8    of death is an illustration of the thesis that death
D04 1510  7    cannot be only a punishment, for some termination seems
D04 1520  4    necessary in a life that is lived within the natural
D04 1530  2    order of time and change.
D04 1530  7       On the other hand, Christian faith knows that death
D04 1540  5    is more than the natural termination of temporal existence.
D04 1550  2    It is the wages of sin, and its sting is the law. If
D04 1570  1    this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished
D04 1570 10    from the idea of death as natural termination, the
D04 1580  7    conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence
D04 1590  3    itself is a form of punishment rather than the state
D04 1600  1    into which man is put by the will of the Creator. This
D04 1600 13    seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was
D04 1610  8    forced. If death receives more than its share of attention
D04 1620  7    from the theologian and if sin receives less than its
D04 1630  4    share, the gift of the life eternal through Christ
D04 1640  1    begins to look like the divinely appointed means of
D04 1640 10    rescue from temporal, i&e&, created, existence. Such
D04 1650  5    an interpretation of death radically alters the Christian
D04 1660  4    view of creation; for it teaches salvation from, not
D04 1670  3    salvation in, time and history. Because Christianity
D04 1680  1    teaches not only salvation in history, but salvation
D04 1680  9    by the history of Christ, such an interpretation of
D04 1690  6    death would require a drastic revision of the Christian
D04 1700  4    understanding of the work of Christ.
D05 0010  1       Furthermore, as an encouragement to revisionist
D05 0010  7    thinking, it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity
D05 0020  8    has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons
D05 0030  6    it dislikes. The Unitarian clergy were an exclusive
D05 0040  3    club of cultivated gentlemen- as the term was then
D05 0040 12    understood in the Back Bay- and Parker was definitely
D05 0050  9    not a gentleman, either in theology or in manners.
D05 0060  7    Ezra Stiles Gannett, an honorable representative of
D05 0070  3    the sanhedrin, addressed himself frankly to the issue
D05 0080  2    in 1845, insisting that Parker should not be persecuted
D05 0080 11    or calumniated and that in this republic no power to
D05 0090  9    restrain him by force could exist. Even so, Gannett
D05 0100  6    judiciously argued, the Association could legitimately
D05 0110  2    decide that Parker "should not be encouraged nor assisted
D05 0120  2    in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from
D05 0120 11    him in regard to their correctness". We today are not
D05 0130  8    entitled to excoriate honest men who believed Parker
D05 0140  6    to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits
D05 0150  4    against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations.
D05 0160  1    One can even argue- though this is a delicate matter-
D05 0170  3    that every justification existed for their returning
D05 0170 10    the Public Lecture to the First Church, and so to suppress
D05 0180  9    it, rather than let Parker use it as a sounding board
D05 0190  7    for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy
D05 0200  4    it. Finally, it did seem clear as day to these clergymen,
D05 0210  1    as Gannett's son explained in the biography of his
D05 0210 10    father, they had always contended for the propriety
D05 0220  8    of their claim to the title of Christians. Their demand
D05 0230  5    against the Calvinist Orthodoxy for intellectual liberty
D05 0240  3    had never meant that they would follow "free inquiry"
D05 0250  1    to the extreme of proclaiming Christianity a "natural"
D05 0250  9    religion.
D05 0260  1       Grant all this- still, when modern Unitarianism
D05 0260  8    and the Harvard Divinity School recall with humorous
D05 0270  8    affection the insults Parker lavished upon them, or
D05 0280  6    else argue that after all Parker received the treatment
D05 0290  4    he invited, they betray an uneasy conscience. Whenever
D05 0300  2    New England liberalism is reminded of the dramatic
D05 0300 10    confrontation of Parker and the fraternity on January
D05 0310  8    23, 1843- while it may defend the privilege of Chandler
D05 0320  7    Robbins to demand that Parker leave the Association,
D05 0330  4    while it may plead that Dr& N& L& Frothingham had every
D05 0340  3    warrant for stating, "The difference between Trinitarians
D05 0350  1    and Unitarians is a difference in Christianity; the
D05 0350  9    difference between Mr& Parker and the Association is
D05 0360  8    a difference between no Christianity and Christianity"-
D05 0370  6    despite these supposed conclusive assurances, the modern
D05 0380  5    liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief, of positive
D05 0390  5    thanksgiving, that the Association never quite brought
D05 0400  2    itself officially to expel Parker. Had it done so,
D05 0400 11    the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible,
D05 0410  8    nor could the Harvard Divinity School assemble today
D05 0420  5    to honor Parker's insurgence other than by getting
D05 0430  4    down on its collective knees and crying "peccavi".
D05 0440  1       Happily for posterity, then, the Boston Association
D05 0440  8    did not actually command Parker to leave the room,
D05 0450  9    though it came too close for comfort to what would
D05 0460  6    have been an unforgivable brutality. Fortunately, the
D05 0470  2    honor of the denomination can attest that Cyrus Bartol
D05 0480  1    defended Parker's sincerity, as did also Gannett and
D05 0480  9    Chandler Robbins; whereupon Parker broke down into
D05 0490  7    convulsions of weeping and rushed out of the room,
D05 0500  6    though not out of the Fellowship. In the hall, after
D05 0510  3    adjournment, Dr& Frothingham took him warmly by the
D05 0511  1    hand and requested Parker to visit him- whereupon our
D05 0520  9    burly Theodore again burst into tears.
D05 0530  5       All this near tragedy, which to us borders on comedy,
D05 0540  3    enables us to tell the story over and over again, always
D05 0550  1    warming ourselves with a glow of complacency. It was
D05 0550 10    indeed a near thing, but somehow the inherent decency
D05 0560  7    of New England (which we inherit) did triumph. Parker
D05 0570  4    was never excommunicated. To the extent that he was
D05 0580  4    ostracized or even reviled, we solace ourselves by
D05 0580 12    saying he asked for it. Yet, even after all these stratagems,
D05 0590 11    the conscience of Christian liberality is still not
D05 0600  7    laid to rest, any more than is the conscience of Harvard
D05 0610  5    University for having done the abject penance for its
D05 0620  3    rejection of Ralph Waldo Emerson's The Divinity School
D05 0630  1    Address of naming its hall of philosophy after him.
D05 0630 10    In both cases the stubborn fact remains: liberalism
D05 0640  6    gave birth to two brilliant apostates, both legitimate
D05 0650  4    offspring of its loins, and when brought to the test,
D05 0660  4    it behaved shabbily. Suppose they both had ventured
D05 0660 12    into realms which their colleagues thought infidel:
D05 0670  7    is this the way gentlemen settle frank differences
D05 0680  4    of opinion? Is it after all possible that no matter
D05 0690  4    how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human
D05 0690 12    dignity they are exposed to a contagion of fear more
D05 0700 10    insidious than any conservative has ever to worry about?
D05 0710  7       However, there is a crucial difference between the
D05 0720  4    two histories. Emerson evaded the problem by shoving
D05 0730  3    it aside, or rather by leaving it behind him: he walked
D05 0740  1    out of the Unitarian communion, so that it could lick
D05 0740 11    the wound of his departure, preserve its self-respect
D05 0750  6    and eventually accord him pious veneration. Parker
D05 0760  3    insisted upon not resigning, even when the majority
D05 0770  1    wanted him to depart, upon daring the Fellowship to
D05 0770 10    throw him out. Hence he was in his lifetime, as is
D05 0780 10    the memory of him afterwards, a canker within the liberal
D05 0790  6    sensitivity. He still points an accusing finger at
D05 0800  3    all of us, telling us we have neither the courage to
D05 0800 14    support him nor the energy to cut his throat.
D05 0810  9       Actually, the dispute between Parker and the society
D05 0820  6    of his time, both ecclesiastical and social, was a
D05 0830  4    real one, a bitter one. It cannot be smoothed over
D05 0830 14    by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of
D05 0840  9    self-deprecation or by solemnly calling for a reconsideration
D05 0850  7    of the justice of the objections to him. The fact is
D05 0860  6    incontestable: that liberal world of Unitarian Boston
D05 0870  2    was narrow-minded, intellectually sterile, smug, afraid
D05 0880  1    of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures
D05 0880 10    into iconoclasm, and quite prepared to resort to hysterical
D05 0890  8    repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened.
D05 0900  4    Parker, along with Garrison and Charles Sumner, showed
D05 0910  4    a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs mobilized
D05 0920  2    in defense of the Mexican War and slavery. Nevertheless,
D05 0930  1    we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry
D05 0930 10    of the populace; their passions were genuine, and the
D05 0940  7    division between them and the abolitionists is clear-cut.
D05 0950  4    But Parker as the ultra-liberal minister within the
D05 0960  2    pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository
D05 0970  1    of liberality poses a different problem, which is not
D05 0970 10    to be resolved by holding him up as the champion of
D05 0980  8    freedom. Even though his theological theses have become,
D05 0990  4    to us, commonplaces, the fundamental interrogation
D05 1000  1    he phrased is very much with us. It has been endlessly
D05 1000 12    rephrased, but I may here put it thus: at what point
D05 1010 11    do the tolerant find themselves obliged to become intolerant?
D05 1020  5    And then, as they become aware that they have reached
D05 1030  5    the end of their patience, what do they, to their dismay,
D05 1040  3    learn for the first time about themselves?
D05 1040 10       There can be no doubt, the Boston of that era could
D05 1050 11    be exquisitely cruel in enforcing its canons of behavior.
D05 1060  7    The gentle Channing, revered by all Bostonians, orthodox
D05 1070  5    or Unitarian, wrote to a friend in Louisville that
D05 1080  2    among its many virtues Boston did not abound in a tolerant
D05 1090  1    spirit, that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality
D05 1090  9    of judgment and action: "No city in the world is governed
D05 1100  9    so little by a police, and so much by mutual inspections
D05 1110  7    and what is called public sentiment. We stand more
D05 1120  4    in awe of one another than most people. Opinion is
D05 1130  1    less individual or runs more into masses, and often
D05 1130 10    rules with a rod of iron". Even more poignantly, and
D05 1140  7    with the insight of a genius, Channing added- remember,
D05 1150  4    this is Channing, not Parker!- that should a minister
D05 1160  7    in Boston trust himself to his heart, should he "speak
D05 1170  3    without book, and consequently break some law of speech,
D05 1180  1    or be hurried into some daring hyperbole, he should
D05 1180 10    find little mercy".
D05 1190  1       Channing wrote this- in a letter! I think it fair
D05 1190 11    to say that he never quite reached such candor in his
D05 1200 11    sermons. But Theodore Parker, commencing his mission
D05 1210  5    to the world-at-large, disguised as the minister of
D05 1220  5    a "twenty-eighth Congregational Church" which bore
D05 1230  2    no resemblance to the Congregational polities descended
D05 1230  9    from the founders (among which were still the Unitarian
D05 1240  8    churches), made explicit from the beginning that the
D05 1250  6    conflict between him and the Hunkerish society was
D05 1260  3    not something which could be evaporated into a genteel
D05 1270  1    difference about clerical decorum. Because he spoke
D05 1270  8    openly with what Channing had prophesied someone might-
D05 1280  6    with daring hyperbole- Parker vindicated Channing's
D05 1290  3    further prophecy that he who committed this infraction
D05 1300  3    of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals
D05 1310  1    were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared
D05 1310  9    to them libertines. An institutionalized liberalism
D05 1320  4    proved itself fundamentally an institution, and only
D05 1330  4    within those defined limits a license.
D05 1340  1       By reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation,
D05 1340 10    we should, I am sure, come to a fresh realization,
D05 1350  9    however painful it be, that the battle between Parker
D05 1360  4    and his neighbors was fought in earnest. He arraigned
D05 1370  2    the citizens in language of so little courtesy that
D05 1370 11    they had to respond with, at the least, resentment.
D05 1380  8    What otherwise could "the lawyer, doctor, minister,
D05 1390  4    the men of science and letters" do when told that they
D05 1400  4    had "become the cherubim and seraphim and the three
D05 1410  1    archangels who stood before the golden throne of the
D05 1410 10    merchant, and continually cried, 'Holy, holy, holy
D05 1420  5    is the Almighty Dollar'"? Nor, when we recollect how
D05 1440  6    sensitive were the emotions of the old Puritan stock
D05 1450  2    in regard to the recent tides of immigration, should
D05 1450 11    we be astonished that their thin lips were compressed
D05 1460  8    into a white line of rage as Parker snarled at them
D05 1470  7    thus: "Talk about the Catholics voting as the bishop
D05 1480  5    tells! reproach the Catholics for it! You and I do
D05 1490  4    the same thing. There are a great many bishops who
D05 1490 14    have never had a cross on their bosom, nor a mitre
D05 1500 10    on their head, who appeal not to the authority of the
D05 1510  6    Pope at Rome, but to the Almighty Dollar, a pope much
D05 1530  4    nearer home. Boston has been controlled by a few capitalists,
D05 1540  1    lawyers and other managers, who told the editors what
D05 1540 10    to say and the preachers what to think". This was war.
D05 1550  9    Parker meant business. And he took repeated care to
D05 1560  7    let his colleagues know that he intended them: "Even
D05 1570  3    the Unitarian churches have caught the malaria, and
D05 1580  2    are worse than those who deceived them"- which implied
D05 1580 11    that they were very bad indeed. It was "Duty" he said
D05 1590 10    that his parents had given him as a rule- beyond even
D05 1600  9    the love that suffused his being and the sense of humor
D05 1610  7    with which he was largely supplied- and it was duty
D05 1620  4    he would perform, though it cost him acute pain and
D05 1620 14    exhausted him by the age of fifty. Parker could weep-
D05 1630 10    and he wept astonishingly often and on the slightest
D05 1640  6    provocation- but the psychology of those tears was
D05 1650  4    entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to
D05 1660  1    massacre his opponents. "If it gave me pleasure to
D05 1660 10    say hard things", he wrote, "I would shut up forever".
D05 1670  8    We have to tell ourselves that when Parker spoke in
D05 1680  6    this vein, he believed what he said, because he could
D05 1690  3    continue, "But the TRUTH, which cost me bitter tears
D05 1700  2    to say, I must speak, though it cost other tears hotter
D05 1700 13    than fire". Because he copiously shed his own tears,
D05 1710  9    and yielded himself up as a living sacrifice to the
D05 1720  8    impersonalized conscience of New England, he was not
D05 1730  4    disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people's
D05 1740  1    consciences.
D05 1740  2       Our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how
D05 1750  1    strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference
D05 1750 10    to the very issue which in the Boston of 1848 seemed
D05 1760  9    to be the central hope of its Christian survival, that
D05 1770  4    of the literal, factual historicity of the miracles
D05 1780  2    as reported in the Four Gospels. It is idle to ask
D05 1780 13    why we are no longer disturbed if somebody, professing
D05 1790  8    the deepest piety, decides anew that it is of no importance
D05 1800  7    whether or not Christ transformed the water into wine
D05 1810  4    at eleven A& M& on the third of August, A& D& 32. We
D05 1820  4    have no answer as to why we are not alarmed. So we
D05 1820 16    are the more prepared to give Parker the credit for
D05 1830 10    having taken the right side in an unnecessary controversy,
D05 1840  6    to salute his courage, and to pass on, happily forgetting
D05 1850  4    both him and the entire episode. We have not the leisure,
D05 1860  3    or the patience, or the skill, to comprehend what was
D05 1860 13    working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate
D05 1870 11    from the Harvard Divinity School who would muster the
D05 1880  7    audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor,
D05 1890  3    the majesterial Andrews Norton, by saying that, while
D05 1900  3    he believed Jesus "like other religious teachers",
D05 1900 10    worked miracles, "I see not how a miracle proves a
D05 1910 10    doctrine".
D06 0010  1       I have, within the past fifty years, come out of
D06 0010 11    all uncertainty into a faith which is a dominating
D06 0020  8    conviction of the Truth and about which I have not
D06 0030  5    a shadow of doubt. It has been my lot all through life
D06 0040  2    to associate with eminent scientists and at times to
D06 0040 11    discuss with them the deepest and most vital of all
D06 0050  9    questions, the nature of the hope of a life beyond
D06 0060  6    this. I have also constantly engaged in scientific
D06 0070  1    work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed
D06 0070 12    in science as well as in the religions in the world.
D06 00800    In an amateu6rish, yet in a very real sense, I have
D06 0090  7    followed the developments of archaeology, geology,
D06 0100  1    astronomy, herpetology, and mycology with a hearty
D06 0100  8    appreciation of the advances being made in these fields.
D06 0110  9       At one time I became disturbed in the faith in which
D06 0120  7    I had grown up by the apparent inroads being made upon
D06 0130  5    both Old and New Testaments by a "Higher Criticism"
D06 0140  2    of the Bible, to refute which I felt the need of a
D06 0140 14    better knowledge of Hebrew and of archaeology, for
D06 0150  8    it seemed to me that to pull out some of the props
D06 0160  8    of our faith was to weaken the entire structure.
D06 0170  1       Doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a
D06 0170  9    while and, like some higher critical friends, trying
D06 0180  8    to continue to use the Bible as the Word of God while
D06 0190  8    at the same time holding it to have been subjected
D06 0200  3    to a vast number of redactions and interpolations:
D06 0210  1    attempting to bridge the chasm between an older, reverent,
D06 0210 10    Bible-loving generation and a critical, doubting,
D06 0220  6    Bible-emancipated
D06 0220  8    race. Although still aware of a great light and glow
D06 0230  9    of warmth in the Book, I stood outside shivering in
D06 0240  5    the cold.
D06 0240  7       In one thing the higher critics, like the modernists,
D06 0250  5    however, overreached themselves, in claiming that the
D06 0260  3    Gospel of John was not written in John's time but well
D06 0270  2    after the first century, perhaps as late as 150 A&D&.
D06 0270 12    Now, if any part of the Bible is assuredly the very
D06 0280 11    Word of God speaking through His servant, it is John's
D06 0290  7    Gospel. To ask me to believe that so inexpressibly
D06 0300  4    marvelous a book was written long after all the events
D06 0310  2    by some admiring follower, and was not inspired directly
D06 0310 11    by the Spirit of God, is asking me to accept a miracle
D06 0320 11    far greater than any of those recorded in the Bible.
D06 0330  7    Here I took my leave of my learned friends to step
D06 0340  4    out on another path, to which we might give the modern
D06 0350  1    name of Pragmatism, or the thing that works. Test it,
D06 0350 11    try it, and if it works, accept it as a guiding principle.
D06 0360 10       So, I put my Bible to the practical test of noting
D06 0370  8    what it says about itself, and then tested it to see
D06 0380  6    how it worked. As a short, possibly not the best method,
D06 0390  2    I looked up "Word" in the Concordance and noted that
D06 0400  1    the Bible claims from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22 to
D06 0400 11    be God's personal message to man. The next traditional
D06 0410  7    step then was to accept it as the authoritative textbook
D06 0420  5    of the Christian faith just as one would accept a treatise
D06 0430  4    on any earthly "science", and I submitted to its conditions
D06 0440  3    according to Christ's invitation and promise that,
D06 0450  1    "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the
D06 0450 13    doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak
D06 0460  9    of myself" (John 7:17).
D06 0470  1       The outcome of such an experiment has been in due
D06 0470 11    time the acceptance of the Bible as the Word of God
D06 0480  9    inspired in a sense utterly different from any merely
D06 0490  5    human book, and with it the acceptance of our Lord
D06 0500  3    Jesus Christ as the only begotten Son of God, Son of
D06 0500 14    Man by the Virgin Mary, the Saviour of the world.
D06 0510 10       I believe, therefore, that we are without exception
D06 0520  7    sinners, by nature alienated from God, and that Jesus
D06 0530  6    Christ, the Son of God, came to earth, the representative
D06 0540  3    Head of a new race, to die upon the cross and pay the
D06 0550  2    penalty of the sin of the world, and that he who thus
D06 0550 14    receives Christ as his personal Saviour is "born again"
D06 0560  8    spiritually, with new privileges, appetites, and affections,
D06 0570  5    destined to live and grow in His likeness forever.
D06 0580  4    Nor can any man save himself by good works or by a
D06 0590  3    commendable "moral life", although such works are the
D06 0590 11    natural fruits and evidences of a saving faith already
D06 0600  9    received and naturally expressing itself through such
D06 0610  5    avenues.
D06 0610  6       I now ever look for Christ acording to His promises
D06 0620  6    and those of the Old Testament as well, to appear again
D06 0630  5    in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness
D06 0640  1    over the whole earth.
D06 0640  5       To state fully what the Bible means as my daily
D06 0650  5    spiritual food is as intimate and difficult as to formulate
D06 0660  2    the reasons for loving my nearest and dearest relatives
D06 0660 11    and friends. The Bible is as obviously and truly food
D06 0670 10    for the spirit as bread is food for the body. Again,
D06 0680  8    as faith reveals God my Father and Christ my Saviour,
D06 0690  5    I follow without question where He leads me daily by
D06 0710  3    His Spirit of love, wisdom, power and prayer. I place
D06 0710 13    His precepts and His leadings above every seeming probability,
D06 0720  9    dismissing cherished convictions and holding the wisdom
D06 0730  7    of man as folly when opposed to Him. I discern no limits
D06 0740  7    to a faith vested in God and Christ, who is the sum
D06 0750  5    of all wisdom and knowledge, and daring to trust Him
D06 0760  1    even though called to stand alone before the world.
D06 0760 10       Our Lord's invitation with its implied promise to
D06 0770  7    all is, "Come and see".
D06 0785  1       I STOOD at the bedside of my patient one day and
D06 0785 12    beheld a very sick man in terrible pain. As I ministered
D06 0790 11    to his needs, I noticed that his face was radiant in
D06 0800  9    spite of his suffering and I learned that he was trusting
D06 0810  6    not only in the skill of his doctor and nurse but also
D06 0820  4    the Lord.
D06 0820  6       In his heart he had that peace of which the Lord
D06 0830  3    spoke when He said, "Peace I leave with you, my peace
D06 0840  1    I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto
D06 0840 13    you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it
D06 0850  9    be afraid".
D06 0860  1       What a joy to realize that we, too, can claim this
D06 0860 11    promise tendered by the Lord during His earthly ministry
D06 0870  7    to a group of men who were very dear to Him. He was
D06 0880  6    about to leave them, to depart from this world, and
D06 0890  2    return to His Father in Heaven. Before He left them
D06 0890 12    He promised that His peace would be their portion to
D06 0900  9    abide in their hearts and minds.
D06 0910  3       I praise God for the privilege of being a nurse
D06 0910 13    who has that peace through faith in the Lord Jesus
D06 0920 10    Christ. It makes my work a great deal easier to be
D06 0930  9    able to pray for the Lord's guidance while ministering
D06 0940  3    to the physical needs of my patients.
D06 0940 10       How often have I looked to Jesus when entering the
D06 0950 10    sick room, asking for His presence and help in my professional
D06 0960  9    duties as I give my talents not only as the world giveth
D06 0970  7    but as one who loves the Saviour and His creatures.
D06 0980  3       Looking unto God, the Prophet Isaiah wrote these
D06 0990  2    blessed words almost three thousand years ago: "Thou
D06 0990 10    wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed
D06 1000 10    on thee: because he trusteth in thee".
D06 1010  5       Are you longing for peace in your heart? Such a
D06 1020  3    calm and assuring peace can be yours. As only a member
D06 1030  1    of the family can share in the innermost joys of the
D06 1030 12    family, likewise one must belong to the family of God
D06 1040  9    in order to receive the benefits that are promised
D06 1050  4    to those who are His own.
D06 1050 10       Perhaps you are not His child. Perhaps you do not
D06 1060  8    know if you belong to Him. You may know that you are
D06 1070  6    in God's family and be just as sure of it as you are
D06 1080  3    that you belong to the family of your earthly father.
D06 1090  1       "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
D06 1090 12    Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
D06 1100  8    but have everlasting life", and "as many as received
D06 1110  6    him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God,
D06 1120  5    even to them that believe on his name".
D06 1130  1       It is to those who believe on His name and belong
D06 1130 12    to Him that He gives His peace; not that empty peace
D06 1140  9    the world offers, but a deep, abiding peace which nothing
D06 1150  5    can destroy.
D06 1150  7       Why not open your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ
D06 1160  7    now, accept Him as your Saviour and let Him fill you
D06 1170  5    with peace that only He can give.
D06 1170 12       Then, with the hymn writer of old, you can say:
D06 1180 10       "I am resting today in His wonderful peace,
D06 1190  5       Resting sweetly in Jesus' control.
D06 1200  1       I am kept from all danger by night and by day,
D06 1200 12       And His glory is flooding my soul".
D06 1215  1       SATELLITES, SPUTNIKS, ROCKETS, BALLOONS; what next?
D06 1220  4    Our necks are stiff from gazing at the wonders of outer
D06 1230  5    space, which have captured the imagination of the American
D06 1240  2    public. Cape Canaveral's achievements thunder forth
D06 1240  8    from the radio, television, and newspaper.
D06 1250  6       While we are filling outer space with scientific
D06 1260  5    successes, for many the "inner" space of their soul
D06 1270  4    is an aching void.
D06 1270  8       Proof? An average of 50 suicides are reported in
D06 1280  4    America each day! One out of every three or four marriages
D06 1290  3    end in divorce! Over $200,000,000 is paid yearly to
D06 1300  1    the 80,000 full-time fortune-tellers in the United
D06 1300 10    States by fearful mankind who want to "know" what the
D06 1310  8    future holds! Delinquency, juvenile and adult, is at
D06 1320  6    an all-time high! Further proof? Read your daily newspaper!
D06 1330  4       Unfortunately, in our rush to beat the Russians,
D06 1340  3    we have forgotten these truth-packed words of Jesus
D06 1340 12    Christ: "What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain
D06 1351 11    the whole world [that includes outer space], and lose
D06 1360  7    his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange
D06 1370  7    for his soul"? (Mark 8:36, 37).
D06 1380  1       Gaining outer space and losing "inner" space is
D06 1380  9    bad business according to God's standards.
D06 1390  5       It is true that we must keep up our national defenses
D06 1400  6    and scientific accomplishments; only a fool would think
D06 1410  5    otherwise. But we must not forget man's soul.
D06 1420  1       Is putting a rocket in orbit half so significant
D06 1420 10    as the good news that God put His Son, Jesus Christ,
D06 1440  3    on earth to live and die to save our hell-bound souls?
D06 1450  6    "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only
D06 1460  5    begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should
D06 1470  1    not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16).
D06 1470  9       Never forget that a chain is only as strong as its
D06 1480 11    weakest link. Your spiritual "inner" space helps determine
D06 1490  5    the spirituality of America as a nation. We trust you
D06 1500  7    are not one of the 70,000,000 Americans who do not
D06 1510  4    attend church, but who feel that various forms of recreation
D06 1520  1    are more important than worshipping the God who made
D06 1520 10    our country great.
D06 1530  1       Is forgiveness of past sins, assurance of present
D06 1530  9    help, and hope of future bliss in your orbit? Or are
D06 1540 10    you trying the devil's substitutes to relieve that
D06 1550  5    spiritual hunger you feel within? Pleasure, fame and
D06 1560  3    fortune, drowning your troubles with a drink, and "living
D06 1570  1    it up" with the gang are like candy bars when you're
D06 1570 12    hungry: they may ease your hunger temporarily, but
D06 1580  8    they'll never take the place of a satisfying, mouth-watering
D06 1590  7    steak.
D06 1590  8       So it is spiritually. No amount of religious ceremonies
D06 1600  6    or even joining a church will relieve the gnawing of
D06 1610  5    your "inner" space. Why? Because your soul was made
D06 1620  4    to be filled with God Himself, not religious functions
D06 1630  1    "about" Him. Only He can satisfy the deepest longings.
D06 1630 10    That is why the Bible commands you to "Taste and see
D06 1640 11    that the Lord is good: blessed [happy] is the man that
D06 1650  9    trusteth in him" (Psalm 34:8).
D06 1660  3       You can receive God into your heart and life by
D06 1670  2    a step of personal faith. Accept the sinless Son of
D06 1670 12    God, Jesus Christ, as your own personal Saviour. "As
D06 1680  8    many as received him [Jesus], to them gave he power
D06 1690  7    to become the sons of God, even to them that believe
D06 1700  5    on his name"
D07 0010  1    "The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall
D07 0010 11    I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom
D07 0020 11    shall I be afraid"? Psalm 27:1
D07 0040  3       A certain teacher scheduled a "Fear Party" for her
D07 0050  3    fourth grade pupils. It was a session at which all
D07 0050 13    the youngsters were told to express their fears, to
D07 0060  8    get them out in the open where they could talk about
D07 0070  6    them freely. The teacher thought it was so successful
D07 0080  3    that she asks: "Wouldn't it be helpful to all age groups
D07 0090  2    if they could participate in a similar confessional
D07 0090 10    of their fears and worries"?
D07 0100  4       Dr& George W& Crane, a medical columnist, thinks
D07 0110  3    it would. He says: "That would reduce neurotic ailments
D07 0120  2    tremendously. Each week an estimated 20 million patients
D07 0120 10    call upon us doctors. Of this number, 50%, or 10 million
D07 0130 11    patients have no diagnosable physical ailments whatever.
D07 0140  6    They are 'worry warts'. Yet they keep running from
D07 0150  6    one physician to another, largely to get a willing
D07 0160  3    ear who will listen to their parade of troubles. One
D07 0160 13    of the most wholesome things you could schedule in
D07 0170  9    your church would thus be a group confessional where
D07 0180  6    people could admit of their inner tensions".
D07 0190  1       We are evidently trying hard to think of new ways
D07 0190 11    to deal with the problem of fear these days. It must
D07 0200 11    be getting more serious. People are giving their doctors
D07 0210  6    a hard time. One doctor made a careful survey of his
D07 0220  6    patients and the reasons for their troubles, and he
D07 0230  2    reported that 40% of them worried about things that
D07 0230 11    never happened; 30% of them worried about past happenings
D07 0240  8    which were completely beyond their control; 12% of
D07 0250  6    them worried about their health, although their ailments
D07 0260  4    were imaginary; 10% of them worried about their friends,
D07 0270  3    neighbors, and relatives, most of whom were quite capable
D07 0280  1    of taking care of themselves. Only 8% of the worries
D07 0280 11    had behind them real causes which demanded attention.
D07 0290  7       Well, most of our fears may be unfounded, but after
D07 0300  7    you discover that fact, you have something else to
D07 0310  3    worry about: Why then do we have these fears? What
D07 0320  1    is the real cause of them? What is there about us that
D07 0320 13    makes us so anxious?
D07 0330  2       Look at the things we do to escape our fears and
D07 0340  1    to forget our worries. We spend millions of dollars
D07 0340 10    every year on fortune tellers and soothsayers. We spend
D07 0350  6    billions of dollars at the race tracks, and more billions
D07 0360  5    on other forms of gambling. We spend billions of dollars
D07 0370  3    on liquor, and many more billions on various forms
D07 0370 12    of escapist entertainment. We consume tons of aspirin
D07 0380  8    and tranquilizers and sleeping pills in order to get
D07 0390  8    a moment's relief from the tensions that are tearing
D07 0400  4    us apart.
D07 0400  6       A visitor from a more peaceful country across the
D07 0410  4    sea was taken to one of our amusement parks, and after
D07 0420  1    he had seen it all, he said to a friend: "You must
D07 0420 13    be a very sad people". "Sad" was not the right word,
D07 0430  9    of course. He should have said "jittery", for that's
D07 0440  6    what we are. And that's worse than sad. Watch people
D07 0450  5    flock to amusement houses, cocktail lounges, and night
D07 0460  3    clubs that advertise continuous entertainment, which
D07 0460  9    means an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid
D07 0470 10    entertainers who are supposed to perform in those incredible
D07 0480  6    ways which are designed to give men a few hours of
D07 0490  6    dubious relaxation- watch them and you can tell that
D07 0500  2    many of them are running away from something.
D07 0500 10       In one of his writings Pascal speaks of this mania
D07 0510  8    for diversion as being a sign of misery and fear which
D07 0520  6    man cannot endure without such opiates. Yes, and as
D07 0530  3    tension mounts in this world, fear is increasing. Does
D07 0530 12    that explain why there is now such a big boom in the
D07 0540 12    bomb shelter business? We have so many new things to
D07 0550  8    fear in this age of nuclear weapons, dreadful things
D07 0560  3    which are too horrible to contemplate. I doubt that
D07 0570  1    "fear parties" and "group confessionals" will help
D07 0570  8    very much. Suppose we do get our fears out in the open,
D07 0580 11    what then? Isn't that where most of them are already-
D07 0590  7    right out on the front page of our newspapers? Maybe
D07 0600  3    we are talking about them too much. The question is:
D07 0610  2    what are we going to do about them?
D07 0610 10       Meanwhile, the enemy will capitalize on our fears,
D07 0620  7    if he can. Hitler did just that 23 years ago, building
D07 0630  5    up tensions that first led to a Munich and then to
D07 0640  2    a world war. The fear of war can make us either too
D07 0640 14    weak to stand and too willing to compromise, or too
D07 0650  8    reckless and too nervous to negotiate for peace as
D07 0660  4    long as there is any chance to negotiate. It is said
D07 0670  2    that fear in human beings produces an odor that provokes
D07 0670 12    animals to attack. It could have the same effect on
D07 0680 10    Communists. The President of the United States has
D07 0690  6    said: "We will never negotiate out of fear, and we
D07 0700  5    will never fear to negotiate". That is a sound position,
D07 0710  1    but it is important that Moscow shall recognize it
D07 0710 10    not merely as the word of a president but as the mind
D07 0720 11    of a free people who are not afraid. And that's another
D07 0730  5    reason why it is imperative for us these days to conquer
D07 0740  4    our fears, to develop the poise that promotes peace.
D07 0750  1       Turning to the Word of God, we find the only sure
D07 0750 12    way to do that. In Psalm 27:1 you read those beautiful
D07 0760  9    words which you must have in your heart if you are
D07 0770  8    to master the fears that surround you, or to drive
D07 0780  4    them out if they have you in their grip: "The Lord
D07 0790  1    is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the
D07 0790 12    Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be
D07 0800 10    afraid"?
D07 0800 11       Well, you say, those are beautiful words all right,
D07 0810  9    but it was easy for the psalmist to sing them in his
D07 0820  7    day. He didn't live in a world of perpetual peril like
D07 0830  3    ours. He didn't know anything about the problems we
D07 0840  2    face today.
D07 0840  4       No? Read the next two verses: "When the wicked,
D07 0850  2    even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat
D07 0850 13    up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Though an host
D07 0860  8    should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear:
D07 0870  5    though war should rise against me, in this will I be
D07 0880  3    confident".
D07 0880  4       That is almost a perfect description of the predicament
D07 0890  3    in which we find ourselves today, isn't it? Our enemy
D07 0900  2    is also threatening to devour us. He has already devoured
D07 0900 12    huge areas of the world, putting men behind concrete
D07 0910  9    walls and iron curtains and barbed wire, reducing them
D07 0920  6    to slavery, systematically crushing not only their
D07 0930  4    bodies but their souls, and shooting them to death
D07 0930 13    if they try to escape their prison. Yes indeed, we
D07 0940  9    too can see a warlike host of infidels encamped against
D07 0950  6    us.
D07 0950  7       What a terrible thing, that "wailing wall" in Berlin!
D07 0960  5    A man with a baby in his arms stood there pleading
D07 0970  3    for his wife who is on the other side with the rest
D07 0980  1    of the family. Another man tried to swim across the
D07 0980 11    river from the East to the West, but was shot and killed.
D07 0990  9    A middle aged woman opened a window on the third floor
D07 1000  7    of her house which was behind the wall, she threw out
D07 1010  4    a few belongings and then jumped; she was fatally injured.
D07 1020  1    The entrance to a church has been walled up, so that
D07 1020 12    the congregation, most of which is in the western sector,
D07 1030  9    cannot worship God there anymore. Practically everybody
D07 1040  4    in Berlin has relatives and friends that live in the
D07 1050  5    opposite part of the city. People stand at the wall
D07 1060  1    giving vent to their feelings, weeping, pounding it
D07 1060  9    with their fists, pleading for loved ones. But the
D07 1070  7    enemy answers them from loudspeakers that pour out
D07 1080  4    Communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible
D07 1090  1    profanity. There is only one escape left, a tragic
D07 1090 10    one, and too many people are taking it: suicide. The
D07 1100  8    normal rate of suicides in East Berlin was one a day,
D07 1110  7    but since the border was closed on August 13 it has
D07 1120  4    jumped to 25 a day!
D07 1120  9       These things may be happening many miles away from
D07 1130  5    us but really they are right next door. We are all
D07 1140  2    involved in them, deeply involved. And nobody knows
D07 1140 10    what comes next. We live from crisis to crisis. And
D07 1150  8    there is only one way for a man to conquer his fears
D07 1160  6    in such a world. He must learn to say with true faith
D07 1170  3    what the psalmist said in a similar world: "The Lord
D07 1180  1    is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the
D07 1180 12    Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be
D07 1190 10    afraid"?
D07 1200  1       Notice that this man had a threefold conception
D07 1210  8    of God which is the secret of his faith. First, "the
D07 1220  6    Lord is my light". He lived in a very dark world, but
D07 1230  5    he was not in the dark. The same God who called this
D07 1240  2    world into being when He said: "Let there be light"!-
D07 1250  3    those were His very first creative words- He began
D07 1250 12    the world with light- this God still gives light to
D07 1260  7    a world which man has plunged into darkness. For those
D07 1270  5    who put their trust in Him He still says every day
D07 1280  3    again: "Let there be light"! And there is light!
D07 1290  1       In fact, He came into this world Himself, in the
D07 1290 11    person of His Son, Jesus Christ, who stood here amid
D07 1300  9    the darkness of human sin and said: "I am the light
D07 1310  8    of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in
D07 1320  6    darkness, but shall have the light of life". The psalmist
D07 1330  2    could say that God was his light even though he could
D07 1330 13    only anticipate the coming of Christ. He lived in the
D07 1340 10    dawn; he could only see the light coming over the horizon.
D07 1350  9    We live in the bright daylight of that great event;
D07 1360  5    for us it is a fact in history. Why should we not have
D07 1370  4    the same faith, and an even greater experience of the
D07 1370 14    light which it gives?
D07 1380  4       This is the faith that moved the psalmist to add
D07 1390  3    his second conception of God: "The Lord is **h my salvation".
D07 1400  1    He knew that his God would save him from his enemies
D07 1410  1    because He had saved him from his sins. If God could
D07 1410 12    do that, He could do anything. The enemies at his gate,
D07 1420  8    threatening to eat up his flesh, were nothing compared
D07 1430  5    with the enemy of sin within his own soul. And God
D07 1440  3    had conquered that one by His grace! So why worry about
D07 1450  1    all the others?
D07 1450  4       The apostle Paul said the same thing in the language
D07 1460  2    and faith of the New Testament: "He that spared not
D07 1470  1    His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall
D07 1470 13    He not with Him freely give us all things? **h If God
D07 1480 10    be for us, who can be against us? **h Who shall separate
D07 1490  7    us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress,
D07 1500  5    or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril,
D07 1510  3    or sword"? (Romans 8:31, 32, 35)
D07 1510  9       Salvation! This is the key to the conquest of fear.
D07 1520  5    This gets down to the heart of our problem, for it
D07 1530  2    reconciles us with God, whom we fear most of all because
D07 1530 13    we have sinned against Him. When that fear has been
D07 1540  9    removed by faith in Jesus Christ, when we know that
D07 1550  6    He is our Savior, that He has paid our debt with His
D07 1560  4    blood, that He has met the demands of God's justice
D07 1570  1    and thus has turned His wrath away- when we know that,
D07 1570 12    we have peace with God in our hearts; and then, with
D07 1580  9    this God on our side, we can face the whole world without
D07 1590  8    fear.
D07 1590  9       And so the psalmist gives us one more picture of
D07 1600  7    God: "The Lord is the strength of my life". The word
D07 1610  6    is really "stronghold". It recalls those words of another
D07 1620  4    psalm: "God is our refuge and strength, a very present
D07 1630  2    help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though
D07 1630 11    the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried
D07 1640  9    into the midst of the sea **h Come, behold the works
D07 1650  7    of the Lord, what desolations He hath made in the earth.
D08 0010  1    But, again, we have no real evidence on this from that
D08 0010 12    quarter until the close of the ninth century A&D&,
D08 0020  8    when an Arabic scholar, Tabit ibn Korra (836-901) is
D08 0030  6    said to have discussed the magic square of three. Thus,
D08 0040  3    while it remains possible that the Babylonians and/or
D08 0050  1    the Pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square
D08 0050 10    of three before the Chinese did, more definite evidence
D08 0060  7    will have to turn up from the Middle East or the Classical
D08 0070  7    World before China can lose her claim to the earliest
D08 0080  5    known magic square by more than a thousand years.
D08 0090  1    #2. THE "LO SHU" SQUARE AS AN EXPRESSION OF CENTRALITY#
D08 0100  1    The concept of the Middle Kingdom at peace, strong
D08 0110  9    and united under a forceful ruler, which had been only
D08 0120  7    a longed-for ideal in the time of the Warring States,
D08 0130  3    was finally realized by the establishment of a Chinese
D08 0140  1    Empire under the Ch'in dynasty (221-207 B&C&). But
D08 0140 10    this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and
D08 0150  8    extremes of totalitarian despotism. Among the many
D08 0160  5    severe measures taken by the First Emperor, Shih Huang-ti,
D08 0170  4    in his efforts to insure the continuation of this hard-won
D08 0180  4    national unity, was the burning of the books in 213
D08 0180 14    B&C&, with the expressed intention of removing possible
D08 0190  8    sources for divergent thinking; but, as he had a special
D08 0200  9    fondness for magic and divination, he ordered that
D08 0210  5    books on these subjects should be spared. Many of the
D08 0220  4    latter were destroyed in their turn, during the burning
D08 0230  1    of the vast Ch'in palace some ten years later; yet
D08 0230 11    some must have survived, because the old interest in
D08 0240  7    number symbolism, divination, and magic persisted on
D08 0250  5    into the Han dynasty, which succeeded in reuniting
D08 0260  1    China and keeping it together for a longer period (from
D08 0260 11    202 B&C& to A&D& 220). In fact, during the first century
D08 0280  4    B&C&, an extensive literature sprang up devoted to
D08 0290  2    these subjects, finding its typical expression in the
D08 0290 10    so-called "wei books", a number of which were specifically
D08 0300  9    devoted to the Lo Shu and related numerical diagrams,
D08 0310  8    especially in connection with divination. However,
D08 0320  4    the wei books were also destroyed in a series of Orthodox
D08 0330  6    Confucian purges which culminated in a final proscription
D08 0340  2    in 605.
D08 0340  4       After all this destruction of old literature, it
D08 0350  2    should be obvious why we have so little information
D08 0350 11    about the early history and development of the Lo Shu,
D08 0360  9    which was already semisecret anyhow. But, in spite
D08 0370  6    of all this, enough evidence remains to show that the
D08 0380  5    magic square of three must indeed have been the object
D08 0390  1    of a rather extensive cult- or series of cults- reaching
D08 0390 11    fullest expression in the Han period.
D08 0400  6       Although modern scholars have expressed surprise
D08 0410  3    that "the simple magic square of three", a mere "mathematical
D08 0420  2    puzzle", was able to exert a considerable influence
D08 0430  1    on the minds and imaginations of the cultured Chinese
D08 0430 10    for so many centuries, they could have found most of
D08 0440  7    the answers right within the square itself. But, up
D08 0460  4    to now, no one has attempted to analyze its inherent
D08 0470  1    mathematical properties, or the numerical significance
D08 0470  7    of its numbers- singly or in combination- and then
D08 0480  9    tried to consider these in the light of Old Chinese
D08 0490  6    cosmological concepts.
D08 0490  8       Such an analysis speedily reveals why the middle
D08 0500  6    number of the Lo Shu, 5, was so vitally significant
D08 0510  5    for the Chinese ever since the earliest hints that
D08 0520  2    they had a knowledge of this diagram. The importance
D08 0520 11    of this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical
D08 0530 10    properties of the middle number and its special relationship
D08 0540  8    to all the rest of the numbers- quite apart from any
D08 0550  5    numerological considerations, which is to say, any
D08 0560  4    symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it. Indeed,
D08 0560 11    mathematically speaking, it was both functionally and
D08 0570  7    symbolically the most important number in the entire
D08 0580  6    diagram.
D08 0580  7       If one takes the middle number, 5, and multiplies
D08 0590  5    it by 3 (the base number of the magic square of three),
D08 0600  4    the result is 15, which is also the constant sum of
D08 0610  1    all the rows, columns, and two main diagonals. Then,
D08 0610 10    if the middle number is activated to its greatest potential
D08 0620  7    in terms of this square, through multiplying it by
D08 0630  4    the highest number, 9 (which is the square of the base
D08 0640  3    number), the result is 45; and the latter is the total
D08 0640 14    sum of all the numbers in the square, by which all
D08 0650 11    the other numbers are overshadowed and in which they
D08 0660  6    may be said to be absorbed.
D08 0660 12       Furthermore, the middle number of the Lo Shu is
D08 0670  9    not only the physical mean between every opposing pair
D08 0680  6    of the other numbers, by reason of its central position;
D08 0690  4    it is also their mathematical mean, since it is equal
D08 0700  3    to half the sum of every opposing pair, all of which
D08 0700 14    equal 10. In fact, the neat balance of these pairs,
D08 0710  9    and their subtle equilibrium, would have had special
D08 0720  5    meaning in the minds of the Old Chinese. For they considered
D08 0730  4    the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female,
D08 0740  1    equating the two groups with the Yang and Yin principles
D08 0740 11    in Nature; and in this square, the respective pairs
D08 0750  8    made up of large and small odd (Yang) numbers, and
D08 0760  6    those composed of large and small even (Yin) numbers,
D08 0770  3    were all equal to each other. Thus all differences
D08 0770 12    were leveled, and all contrasts erased, in a realm
D08 0780  9    of no distinction, and the harmonious balance of the
D08 0790  6    Lo Shu square could effectively symbolize the world
D08 0800  4    in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis.
D08 0810  1       The tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the Lo Shu square-
D08 0820  3    for purely mathematical reasons- and the fact that
D08 0820 11    this number so neatly symbolized the heart and center
D08 0830  7    of the universe, could well explain why the Old Chinese
D08 0840  5    seem to have so revered the number 5, and why they
D08 0850  3    put so much stress on the concept of Centrality. These
D08 0850 13    twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in
D08 0860  9    the Han dynasty.
D08 0870  1       The existing reverence for Centrality must have
D08 0870  8    been still further stimulated toward the close of the
D08 0880  7    second century B&C&, when the Han Emperor Wu Ti ordered
D08 0890  7    the dynastic color changed to yellow- which symbolized
D08 0900  5    the Center among the traditional Five Directions- and
D08 0910  4    took 5 as the dynastic number, believing that he would
D08 0910 14    thus place himself, his imperial family, and the nation
D08 0920  9    under the most auspicious influences. His immediate
D08 0930  4    motive for doing this may not have been directly inspired
D08 0940  4    by the Lo Shu, but this measure must inevitably have
D08 0950  2    increased the existing beliefs in the latter's efficacy.
D08 0960  1       After this time, inscriptions on the Han bronze
D08 0960  9    mirrors, as well as other writings, emphasized the
D08 0970  6    desirability of keeping one's self at the center of
D08 0980  6    the universe, where cosmic forces were strongest. Later,
D08 0990  2    we shall see what happened when an emperor took this
D08 0990 12    idea too literally.
D08 1000  2       All this emphasis on Centrality and on the number
D08 1010  1    5 as a symbolic expression of the Center, which seems
D08 1010 11    to have begun as far back as 400 B&C&, also may conceivably
D08 1020 10    have led to the development of the Five-Elements School
D08 1030  6    and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical
D08 1040  5    categories of five. We find, for example, such groupings
D08 1050  3    as the Five Ancient Rulers, the Five Sacred Mountains,
D08 1060  1    the Five Directions (with Center), the Five Metals,
D08 1060  9    Five Colors, Five Tastes, Five Odors, Five Musical
D08 1070  8    Notes, Five Bodily Functions, Five Viscera, and many
D08 1080  7    others. This trend has often been ascribed to the cult
D08 1090  7    of the Five Elements itself, as though they had served
D08 1100  4    as the base for all the rest; but why did the Old Chinese
D08 1110  2    postulate five elements, when the Ancient Near East-
D08 1120  3    which may have initiated the idea that natural elements
D08 1120 12    exerted influence in human life and activities- recognized
D08 1130  7    only four? And why did the Chinese suddenly begin to
D08 1140  7    talk about the Five Directions, when the animals they
D08 1150  5    used as symbols of the directions designated only the
D08 1160  2    usual four? Obviously, something suddenly caused them
D08 1160  9    to start thinking in terms of fives, and that may have
D08 1170 10    been the workings of the Lo Shu.
D08 1190  4       This whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on
D08 1200  2    Chinese thinking. Whereas the primary meanings of the
D08 1200 10    Lo Shu diagram seemed to have been based on its inner
D08 1210 10    mathematical properties- and we shall see that even
D08 1220  9    its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical
D08 1230  3    bases- the urgent desire to place everything into categories
D08 1240  2    of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers,
D08 1240 12    until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded
D08 1250  8    Chinese thought. Scholars made numbered sets of as
D08 1260  7    many things as possible in Nature, or assigned arbitrary
D08 1270  4    numbers to individual things, in a fashion that seems
D08 1280  2    to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical,
D08 1280 10    and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended
D08 1290  8    to stifle speculative thought in China for many centuries.
D08 1300  6    #3. YIN AND YANG IN THE "LO SHU" SQUARE#
D08 1310  2    Although the primary mathematical properties of the
D08 1310  9    middle number at the center of the Lo Shu, and the
D08 1320 11    interrelation of all the other numbers to it, might
D08 1330  9    seem enough to account for the deep fascination which
D08 1340  3    the Lo Shu held for the Old Chinese philosophers, this
D08 1350  2    was actually only a beginning of wonders. For the Lo
D08 1360  1    Shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of
D08 1360  9    most of the chief religious and philosophical ideas
D08 1370  5    of its time. As such, one cannot fully understand the
D08 1380  4    thought of the pre-Han and Han periods without knowing
D08 1390  2    the meanings inherent in the Lo Shu; but, conversely,
D08 1400  1    one cannot begin to understand the Lo Shu without knowing
D08 1400 11    something about the world view of the Old Chinese,
D08 1410  9    which they felt they saw expressed in it.
D08 1420  5       The Chinese world view during the Han dynasty, when
D08 1430  2    the Lo Shu seems to have been at the height of its
D08 1440  1    popularity, was based in large part on the teachings
D08 1440 10    of the Yin-Yang and Five-Elements School, which was
D08 1450  7    traditionally founded by Tsou Yen. According to this
D08 1460  5    doctrine, the universe was ruled by Heaven, T'ien-
D08 1470  1    as a natural force, or in the personification of a
D08 1470 11    Supreme Sky-god- governing all things by means of a
D08 1480 10    process called the Tao, which can be roughly interpreted
D08 1500  6    as "the Order of the Universe" or "the Universal Way".
D08 1510  5    Heaven, acting through the Tao, expressed itself by
D08 1520  4    means of the workings of two basic principles, the
D08 1530  2    Yin and the Yang. The Yang, or male principle, was
D08 1530 12    the source of light, heat, and dynamic vitality, associated
D08 1540  8    with the Sun; while the Yin, or female principle, flourished
D08 1550  7    in darkness, cold, and quiet inactivity, and was associated
D08 1560  5    with the Moon. Together these two principles influenced
D08 1570  3    all things, and in varying combinations they were present
D08 1580  2    in everything.
D08 1580  4       We have already seen that odd numbers were considered
D08 1590  3    as being Yang, while the even numbers were Yin, so
D08 1600  1    that the eight outer numbers of the Lo Shu represented
D08 1600 11    these two principles in balanced equilibrium around
D08 1610  6    the axial center. During the Han dynasty, another Yin-Yang
D08 1620  7    conception was applied to the Lo Shu, considering the
D08 1630  4    latter as a plan of Ancient China. Instead of linking
D08 1640  3    the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional
D08 1640 12    Nine Provinces, as was usually done, this equated the
D08 1650  5    odd, Yang numbers with mountains (firm and resistant,
D08 1660  6    hence Yang) and the even numbers with rivers (sinuous
D08 1670  4    and yielding, hence Yin); taking the former from the
D08 1680  3    Five Sacred Mountains of the Han period and the latter
D08 1680 13    from the principal river systems of Old China.
D08 1690  8       Thus the middle number, 5, represented Sung-Shan
D08 1700  6    in Honan, Central China; the 3, T'ai-Shan in Shantung,
D08 1710  6    East China; the 7, Hwa-Shan in Shensi, West China;
D08 1720  3    the 1, Heng-Shan in Hopei, North China (or the mountain
D08 1730  3    with the same name in neighboring Shansi); and the
D08 1740  1    9, Huo-Shan in Anhwei, which was then the South Sacred
D08 1740 12    Mountain. For the rivers, the 4 represented the Huai,
D08 1750  9    to the (then) Southeast; the 2, the San Kiang (three
D08 1760  7    rivers) in the (then) Southwest; the 8, the Chi in
D08 1770  6    the Northeast; and the 6, the (upper) Yellow River
D08 1780  1    in the Northwest.
D08 1780  4       Note that by Western standards this plan was "upside
D08 1790  4    down", as it put North at the bottom and South at the
D08 1800  3    top, with the other directions correspondingly altered;
D08 1800 10    but in this respect it was merely following the accepted
D08 1810  9    Chinese convention for all maps. The same arrangement
D08 1820  7    was used when the Lo Shu was equated with the Nine
D08 1830  5    Provinces; and whenever the Lo Shu involved directional
D08 1840  3    symbolism, it was oriented in this same fashion.
D09 0010  1    Few persons who join the Church are insincere. They
D09 0010 10    earnestly desire to do the will of God. When they fall
D09 0020 10    by the wayside and fail to achieve Christian stature,
D09 0030  3    it is an indictment of the Church. These fatalities
D09 0040  2    are dramatic evidence of "halfway evangelism", a failure
D09 0050  1    to follow through. A program of Lay Visitation Evangelism
D09 0050 10    can end in dismal defeat with half the new members
D09 0060 10    drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous
D09 0070  5    efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship.
D09 0080  2       The work of Lay Visitation Evangelism is not completed
D09 0090  2    when all of the persons on the Responsibility List
D09 0090 11    have been interviewed. In the average situation about
D09 0100  8    one-third of those visited make commitments to Christ
D09 0110  5    and the Church. The pastor and the Membership Preparation
D09 0120  3    and Assimilation Committee must follow through immediately
D09 0130  3    with a carefully planned program. The first thirty
D09 0140  1    to sixty days after individuals make their decision
D09 0140  9    will determine their interest and participation in
D09 0150  6    the life of the Church. Neglect means spiritual paralysis
D09 0160  4    or death.
D09 0160  6    #PREPARATION FOR MEMBERSHIP#
D09 0160  9    CHURCHES THAT HAVE a carefully planned program of membership
D09 0170  9    preparation and assimilation often keep 85 to 90 per
D09 0180  9    cent of their new members loyal and active. This is
D09 0190  6    the answer to the problem of "membership delinquency".
D09 0200  2       It is important that persons desiring to unite with
D09 0210  3    the Church be prepared for this experience so that
D09 0210 12    it may be meaningful and spiritually significant. It
D09 0220  8    is unfair and unchristian to ask a person to take the
D09 0230  8    sacred vows of Church membership before he has been
D09 0240  5    carefully instructed concerning their implications.
D09 0250  1       Preparation for Church membership begins immediately
D09 0250  7    after the commitment is received.
D09 0260  5    _1)_
D09 0260  6       The pastor writes a personal letter to each individual,
D09 0270  4    expressing his joy over the decision, assuring him
D09 0280  2    of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time,
D09 0280 11    and outlining the plan for membership preparation classes
D09 0290  7    and Membership Sunday. Some pastors write a letter
D09 0300  6    the same night the decision is reported by the visitors.
D09 0310  4    It should not be postponed later than the next day.
D09 0320  1    A helpful leaflet may be enclosed in the letter.
D09 0320 10    _2)_
D09 0320 11       The pastor calls in the home of each individual
D09 0330  8    or family for a spiritual guidance conference. If possible,
D09 0340  4    he should make an appointment in order that all persons
D09 0350  4    involved may be present. This is not a social call.
D09 0360  2    It is definitely a "spiritual guidance conference".
D09 0360  9    He will discuss the significance of Christian commitment,
D09 0370  8    the necessity of family religion and private devotions,
D09 0380  7    and the importance of the membership preparation sessions.
D09 0390  4    There may be problems of conduct or questions of belief
D09 0400  4    which will require his counsel. Each conference should
D09 0410  2    be concluded naturally with prayer. A piece of devotional
D09 0410 11    material, such as The Upper Room, may be left in each
D09 0420 11    home.
D09 0430  1    _3)_
D09 0430  1       A minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership
D09 0430 10    is necessary for adults. Some churches require more.
D09 0440  7    None should ask less. Those who join the Church need
D09 0450  7    to be instructed in the faith and the meaning of Christian
D09 0460  4    discipleship before they take the sacred vows. They
D09 0470  3    will have a greater appreciation for the Church and
D09 0470 12    a deeper devotion to it if membership requires something
D09 0480  8    of them.
D09 0480 10       Many churches find the Sunday school hour to be
D09 0490  9    the most practical time for adult preparation classes.
D09 0500  5    Others meet on Sunday night, at the mid-week service,
D09 0510  4    or for a series of four nights. Some pastors have two
D09 0520  2    sessions in one evening, with a refreshment period
D09 0520 10    between.
D09 0530  1       The sessions should cover four major areas:
D09 0530  7    _A_
D09 0530  8       - The Christian Faith
D09 0540  2    _B_
D09 0540  3       - History of the Church
D09 0540  7    _C_
D09 0540  8       - Duties of Church Membership
D09 0550  2    _D_
D09 0550  3       - The Local Church and Its Program
D09 0560  1       Following each instruction period a piece of literature
D09 0560  9    dealing with the topic should be handed each one for
D09 0570 10    further reading during the week. This procedure is
D09 0580  5    much more effective than giving out a membership packet.
D09 0590  2    #FOURTH SESSION IMPORTANT#
D09 0590  5    MOST PASTORS FIND that the fourth session should take
D09 0600  7    at least two hours and therefore hold it on a week
D09 0610  6    night prior to Reception Sunday. In this session the
D09 0620  2    persons seeking membership are provided information
D09 0620  8    concerning the work of the denomination as well as
D09 0630  8    the program and activities of the local church. The
D09 0640  4    lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak
D09 0650  1    on the various phases of church life, service opportunities,
D09 0650 10    the church school, missions, men's work, women's work,
D09 0660  7    youth program, social activities, and finances. The
D09 0670  5    budget of the church may be presented and pledges solicited
D09 0680  4    at this session. An "interest finder" or "talent sheet"
D09 0690  3    may be filled out by each person. (See sample on pp&
D09 0700  2    78-79.) The fourth session may be concluded with a
D09 0700 12    tour of the church facilities and refreshments. The
D09 0710  6    social time gives an opportunity for church leaders
D09 0720  4    to become acquainted with the new members.
D09 0720 11    #ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP PREPARATION#
D09 0730  5    IN CONDUCTING the Membership Preparation-Inquirers'
D09 0740  5    Class, the pastor should plan a variety of teaching
D09 0750  6    techniques in order to develop greater interest on
D09 0760  2    the part of the class. The following have been found
D09 0760 12    effective.
D09 0770  1    _1)_
D09 0770  2       Extend the number of classes. Some churches have
D09 0780  1    six or more training sessions of two hours each, generally
D09 0780 11    held on Sunday night or during the week. This gives
D09 0790  8    greater opportunity for the learning process.
D09 0800  3    _2)_
D09 0800  4       Use dramatization- for example, in discussing the
D09 0810  3    Lord's Supper or church symbolism.
D09 0810  8    _3)_
D09 0810  9       Use audio-visual aids. Some excellent filmstrips
D09 0820  7    with recordings and motion pictures may be secured
D09 0830  5    from your denominational headquarters to enrich the
D09 0840  3    class session.
D09 0840  5    _4)_
D09 0840  6       Have a "Question Box". Some new members will hesitate
D09 0850  6    to ask questions audibly. Urge them to write out their
D09 0860  5    questions for the box.
D09 0860  9    _5)_
D09 0860 10       Use a textbook with assigned readings each week.
D09 0870  6    _6)_
D09 0870  7       Select class members for reports on various phases
D09 0880  5    of the study.
D09 0880  8    _7)_
D09 0880  9       Conduct examinations, using a true-false check sheet.
D09 0890  7    _8)_
D09 0890  8       Ask each member to write a statement on such topics
D09 0900  8    as: "What Christ Means to Me", "What the Church Means
D09 0910  6    to Me", "Why Join the Church", "The Duties of Church
D09 0920  5    Members", etc&.
D09 0920  7    _9)_
D09 0920  8       Assign a series of catechism questions to be memorized.
D09 0930  9    _10)_
D09 0940  1       Invite class members to share in an extra period
D09 0940  9    of Bible study each week.
D09 0950  2    _11)_
D09 0950  3       Ask each new member to bring his Pledge of Loyalty
D09 0960  1    to the Reception Service.
D09 0960  5    #WHAT ABOUT TRANSFERS?#
D09 0960  8    THERE IS A GROWING CONVICTION among pastors and Church
D09 0970  9    leaders that all those who come into the fellowship
D09 0980  8    of the Church need preparatory training, including
D09 0990  3    those coming by transfer of membership. George E& Sweazey
D09 1000  2    writes: "There is danger in trying to make admission
D09 1010  1    to the Church so easy and painless that people will
D09 1010 11    scarcely know that anything has happened".
D09 1020  5       People appreciate experiences that demand something
D09 1030  4    of them. Those who transfer their membership are no
D09 1040  2    exception to the rule. For most of them, it will be
D09 1040 13    their first experience in membership training, since
D09 1050  6    this is a recent development in many churches. Those
D09 1060  5    coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity
D09 1070  3    to become informed.
D09 1070  6       The preparatory class is an introductory face-to-face
D09 1080  6    group in which new members become acquainted with one
D09 1090  3    another. It provides a natural transition into the
D09 1090 11    life of the local church and its organizations.
D09 1100  8    #RECEPTION INTO THE CHURCH FELLOWSHIP#
D09 1110  2    THE TOTAL PROCESS of evangelism reaches the crescendo
D09 1120  1    when the group of new members stands before the congregation
D09 1120 11    to declare publicly their faith and to be received
D09 1130  9    into the fellowship of the Church. This should be a
D09 1140  8    high moment in their lives, a never-to-be-forgotten
D09 1150  1    experience. They should sense the tremendous significance
D09 1160  1    of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to
D09 1160  9    Christ our Lord and forward to an eternal fellowship
D09 1170  8    with the saints of the ages.
D09 1180  1       Every detail of the service merits careful attention-
D09 1180  9    the hymns, the sermon, the ritual, the right hand of
D09 1190 10    fellowship, the introduction to the congregation, the
D09 1200  5    welcome of the congregation. This is a vital part of
D09 1210  5    their spiritual growth and assimilation. It will help
D09 1220  1    to determine the attitude of the new members toward
D09 1220 10    the Church. It can mean the difference between participation
D09 1230  7    and inaction, spiritual growth and decay.
D09 1240  4       The worship service is the natural and logical time
D09 1250  2    to receive new members into the Church. The atmosphere
D09 1250 11    for this momentous experience can be created most effectively
D09 1260  9    through the worship experience. Psychologically the
D09 1270  5    reception should be the climax, following the sermon.
D09 1280  5    _1)_
D09 1280  6       Ask the new members to meet thirty minutes before
D09 1290  3    the service to complete "talent sheets" and pledge
D09 1300  1    cards. Some denominations ask new members to sign personally
D09 1300 10    the chronological membership register. Provide a name
D09 1310  7    card for each new member. Outline plans for the entire
D09 1320  8    service.
D09 1320  9    _2)_
D09 1320 10       Arrange a reserved section in the sanctuary where
D09 1330  7    all new members may sit together. Sponsors may sit
D09 1340  4    with them also.
D09 1340  7    _3)_
D09 1340  8       Invite sponsors or Fellowship Friends to stand back
D09 1350  5    of the new members in the reception service.
D09 1360  1    _4)_
D09 1360  2       Give each new member a certificate of membership.
D09 1360 10    _5)_
D09 1370  1       Introduce each new member to the congregation, asking
D09 1370  9    him to face the congregation.
D09 1380  3    _6)_
D09 1380  4       Lead the congregation in a response of welcome.
D09 1390  2    _7)_
D09 1390  3       Have a reception for new members in the parlor or
D09 1400  1    social hall immediately after the service.
D09 1400  7    _8)_
D09 1400  8       Take a picture of the group of new members to be
D09 1410  8    put in the church paper or placed on the bulletin board.
D09 1420  3    _9)_
D09 1420  4       Have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with new members
D09 1430  3    as guests.
D09 1430  5    #CHAPTER 6 PLANNING FOR THE ASSIMILATION AND GROWTH
D09 1440  2    OF NEW MEMBERS#
D09 1440  5    THE CHURCH is "the family of God". The members of the
D09 1450  5    "family" are drawn together by a common love for Christ
D09 1460  3    and a sincere devotion to His Kingdom. Every member
D09 1470  1    of the family must have a vital place in its life.
D09 1470 12    This is no spectator-type experience; everyone is to
D09 1480  5    be a participant.
D09 1480  8       Yet the most difficult problem in the Church's program
D09 1490  8    of evangelism is right at this point- helping new members
D09 1500  7    to become participating, growing parts of the fellowship.
D09 1510  5    Very easily they may be neglected and eventually join
D09 1520  2    the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive.
D09 1520  9       A study of major denominational membership statistics
D09 1530  6    over a twenty-year period revealed the appalling fact
D09 1540  5    that nearly 40 per cent of those who joined the Church
D09 1550  4    were lost to the Church within seven years. One denomination
D09 1560  2    had a membership of 1,419,833 at the beginning of the
D09 1570  1    period under study, and twenty years later its membership
D09 1570 10    stood at 1,541,991- a net growth of only 122,158. Yet
D09 1580 10    during the same period there were 1,080,062 additions.
D09 1590  4    Another major church body had 4,499,608 members and
D09 1600  3    twenty years later its membership stood at 4,622,444.
D09 1600 11    During this time 4,122,354 new members were brought
D09 1610  8    into the fellowship. Still another denomination had
D09 1620  5    7,360,187 members twenty years ago. During this period
D09 1630  3    7,484,268 members were received, yet the net membership
D09 1640  1    now is only 9,910,741. These figures indicate that
D09 1640  9    we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into
D09 1650  9    membership.
D09 1650 10       This problem is illustrated by the fact that many
D09 1660  8    local churches drop from the active membership rolls
D09 1670  4    each year as many as they receive into the fellowship.
D09 1680  1    Studies of membership trends, even in some areas where
D09 1680 10    population is expanding, show that numbers of churches
D09 1690  8    have had little net increase, though many new members
D09 1700  6    were received. Something is wrong when these things
D09 1710  3    happen. The local "family of God" has failed its new
D09 1720  2    members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual
D09 1720 10    welfare.
D09 1730  1    #BASIC NEEDS#
D09 1730  3    NEW MEMBERS can become participating, growing members.
D09 1740  2    But this will not happen merely through the natural
D09 1740 11    process of social life. It must be planned and carefully
D09 1750 10    developed. The entire membership of the local church
D09 1760  7    must be alerted to their part in this dynamic process.
D09 1770  5       If the church has followed the plan of cultivation
D09 1780  3    of prospects and carried through a program of membership
D09 1790  1    preparation as outlined earlier in this book, the process
D09 1790 10    of assimilation and growth will be well under way.
D09 1800  8    Those who enter the front door of the church intelligently
D09 1810  6    and with Christian dedication will not so easily step
D09 1820  5    through the back door because of lost interest.
D09 1830  1       However, it is not enough to bring persons to Christian
D09 1830 11    commitment and train them in the meaning of Christian
D09 1840  9    discipleship. When they unite with the Church they
D09 1850  7    must find in this fellowship the satisfaction of their
D09 1860  3    basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into
D09 1870  1    effective Christians.
D09 1870  3       The Church expects certain things of those who become
D09 1880  4    members. The new members justifiably expect some things
D09 1890  1    from their church family:
D09 1890  5       - Welcome into the fellowship
D09 1900  3       - Sincere Christian love and understanding
D09 1900  8       - Inspiring and challenging worship experiences
D09 1910  5       - Social and recreational activities
D09 1920  1       - Opportunities for Christian service
D09 1930  3       - Opportunities for study of the Christian faith
D09 1930 10    and the Bible
D09 1940  3       - Creative prayer experiences
D09 1940  6       - Guidance in Christian social concerns
D10 0010  1       MEN need unity and they need God. Care must be taken
D10 0010 12    neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor God with
D10 0020  9    our parochial ideas about him, but with these two qualifications,
D10 0030  8    the statement stands. The statement also points to
D10 0040  6    a classic paradox: The more men turn toward God, who
D10 0050  4    is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but
D10 0060  1    also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately
D10 0060 11    be established, the more men splinter into groups and
D10 0070  8    set themselves apart from one another. To be reminded
D10 0080  5    of this we need only glance at the world map and note
D10 0090  3    the extent to which religious divisions have compounded
D10 0090 11    political ones, with a resultant fragmentation of the
D10 0100  8    human race. Massacres attending the partition of India
D10 0110  6    and the establishment of the State of Israel are simply
D10 0120  5    recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions
D10 0130  2    can engender. The words of Cardinal Newman come forcibly
D10 0135  1    to mind: "Oh how we hate one another for the love of
D10 0140 12    God"!
D10 0150  1       The source of this paradox is not difficult to identify.
D10 0150 11    It lies in institutions. Institutions require structure,
D10 0160  6    form, and definition, and these in turn entail differentiation
D10 0170  7    and exclusion. A completely amorphous institution would
D10 0180  4    be a contradiction in terms; to escape this fate, it
D10 0190  4    must rule some things out. For every criterion which
D10 0200  1    defines what something is, at the same time proclaims-
D10 0200 10    implicitly if not openly- what that something is not.
D10 0210  8    Some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose
D10 0220  7    that we do away with institutions altogether; in the
D10 0230  3    present context this amounts to the advice that while
D10 0240  1    being religious may have a certain justification, we
D10 0240  9    ought to dispense with churches. The suggestion is
D10 0250  6    naive. Man is at once a gregarious animal and a form-creating
D10 0260  6    being. Having once committed himself to an ideal which
D10 0270  4    he considers worthwhile, he inevitably creates forms
D10 0280  1    for its expression and institutions for its continuance.
D10 0280  9    To propose that men be religious without having religious
D10 0290  7    institutions is like proposing that they be learned
D10 0300  5    without having schools. Both eventualities are possible
D10 0310  3    logically, but practically they are impossible. As
D10 0310 10    much as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded
D10 0320 10    in God, they instrumentally require the institutions
D10 0330  4    that will direct their steps toward him.
D10 0340  2       Yet the fact remains that such institutions do set
D10 0340 11    men at odds with their fellows. Is there any way out
D10 0350 11    of the predicament? The only way that I can see is
D10 0360  9    through communication. Interfaith communication need
D10 0370  3    not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited upon
D10 0380  2    us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations
D10 0380 10    with our adversaries. Approached creatively, it is
D10 0390  6    a high art. It is the art of relating the finite to
D10 0400  6    the infinite, of doing our best to insure that the
D10 0410  2    particularistic requirements of religious institutions
D10 0410  7    will not thwart God's intent of unity among men more
D10 0420  9    than is minimally necessary. In a certain sense, interfaith
D10 0430  6    communication parallels diplomatic communication among
D10 0440  3    the nation-states.
D10 0440  6       What are the pertinent facts affecting such communication
D10 0450  5    at the present juncture of history? I shall touch on
D10 0460  5    three areas: personal, national, and theological.
D10 0470  1    #/1,#
D10 0470  2    By personal factors I mean those rooted in personality
D10 0480  1    structure. Some interfaith tensions are not occasioned
D10 0480  8    by theological differences at all, but by the need
D10 0490  8    of men to have persons they can blame, distrust, denounce,
D10 0500  5    and even hate. Such needs may rise to pathological
D10 0510  3    proportions. Modern psychology has shown that paralleling
D10 0520  1    "the authoritarian personality" is "the bigoted personality"
D10 0530  1    in which insecurity, inferiority, suspicion, and distrust
D10 0530  8    combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable
D10 0540  9    that it will be manufactured if it does not exist naturally.
D10 0550  7    Fortunately the number of pathological bigots appears
D10 0560  4    to be quite small, but it would be a mistake to think
D10 0570  3    that more than a matter of degree separates them from
D10 0570 13    the rest of us. To some extent the personal inadequacies
D10 0580 10    that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be
D10 0590  8    found in all of us.
D10 0590 13       Interfaith conflicts which spring from psychological
D10 0600  6    deficiencies are the most unfortunate of all, for they
D10 0610  6    have no redeeming features whatsoever. It is difficult
D10 0620  4    to say what can be done about them except that we must
D10 0630  1    learn to recognize when it is they, rather than pretexts
D10 0630 11    for them, that are causing the trouble, and do everything
D10 0640  9    possible to nurture the healthy personalities that
D10 0650  4    will prevent the development of such deficiencies.
D10 0660  1    #/2,#
D10 0660  2    While the personality factors that aggravate interfaith
D10 0670  1    conflict may be perennial, nationalism is more variable.
D10 0670  9    The specific instance I have in mind is the Afro-Asian
D10 0680 11    version which has gained prominence only in this second
D10 0690  8    half of the twentieth century.
D10 0700  1       Emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination,
D10 0700  9    the Afro-Asian world is aflame with a nationalism that
D10 0710 10    has undone empires. No less than twenty-two nations
D10 0720  7    have already achieved independence since World War
D10 0730  4    /2,, and the number is growing by the year. As an obvious
D10 0740  3    consequence, obstacles to genuine interfaith communication
D10 0750  1    have grown more formidable in one important area: relations
D10 0750 10    between Christians and non-Christians in these lands.
D10 0760  8    Colonialism alone would have been able to make these
D10 0770  7    difficulties serious, for Christianity is so closely
D10 0780  4    tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that
D10 0790  1    repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward
D10 0790  9    the repudiation of the other. Actually, however, this
D10 0800  7    turns out to be only part of the picture. Nationalism
D10 0810  4    has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign religions
D10 0820  2    but the revival of native ones, some of which had been
D10 0820 13    lying in slumber for centuries. The truth is that any
D10 0830 10    revival of traditional and indigenous religion will
D10 0840  5    serve to promote that sense of identity and Volksgeist
D10 0850  3    which these young nations very much need. Insofar as
D10 0860  2    these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways
D10 0860 10    of life which constitute ultimate, trans-political
D10 0870  6    justifications for their existence, such people are
D10 0880  4    inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which these
D10 0890  2    traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone
D10 0890 10    else's.
D10 0900  1       All this works severely against the kind of cross-cultural
D10 0910  1    communication for which Christian missions stand. Africans
D10 0910  8    and Asians tend to consider not only missions but the
D10 0920  9    local churches they have produced as centers and agents
D10 0930  6    of Western culture and ideology if not of direct political
D10 0940  4    propaganda. The people hardest hit by this suspicion
D10 0950  1    are, of course, Christians on the mainland of China.
D10 0950 10    But the problem extends elsewhere. For example, in
D10 0960  7    Burma and Ceylon many Buddhists argue that Buddhism
D10 0970  4    ought to be the official state religion. In 1960 Ceylon
D10 0980  4    nationalized its sectarian- preponderantly Christian-
D10 0990  3    schools, to the rejoicing of most of its 7,000,000
D10 0990 12    Buddhists and the lament of its 800,000 Roman Catholics.
D10 1000  8    Again, India has imposed formidable barriers against
D10 1010  4    the entrance of additional missionaries, and fanatical
D10 1020  3    Hindu parties are expected to seek further action against
D10 1030  1    Christians once the influence making for tolerance
D10 1030  8    due to Nehru and his followers is gone.
D10 1040  6       The progressive closing of Afro-Asian ears to the
D10 1050  4    Christian message is epitomized in a conversation I
D10 1060  2    had three years ago while flying from Jerusalem to
D10 1060 11    Cairo. I was seated next to the director of the Seventh
D10 1070  9    Day Adventists' world radio program. He said that on
D10 1080  7    his tour the preceding year a considerable number of
D10 1090  3    hours would have been available to him on Japanese
D10 1090 12    radio networks, but that he had then lacked the funds
D10 1100 10    to contract for them. After returning to the United
D10 1110  6    States and raising the money, he discovered on getting
D10 1120  4    back to Japan that the hours were no longer available.
D10 1130  1    It was not that they had been contracted for during
D10 1130 11    the interval; they simply could no longer be purchased
D10 1140  8    for missionary purposes. It is not unfair to add on
D10 1150  8    the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic
D10 1160  2    approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the
D10 1160  9    cultures and religions among which they work has contributed
D10 1170  9    measurably to this heightening of anti-Christian sentiment.
D10 1180  6    Ironically, these are the groups which have doubled
D10 1190  5    or tripled their missionary efforts since World War
D10 1200  3    /2,, while the more established denominations are barely
D10 1210  1    maintaining pre-war staffs.
D10 1210  5       Although I have emphasized the barriers which an
D10 1220  4    aroused nationalism has raised against relations between
D10 1230  1    Christians and non-Christians in Asia, the fact is
D10 1230 10    that this development has also widened the gulf between
D10 1240  7    certain Afro-Asian religions themselves. The partition
D10 1250  4    of India has hardly improved relations between Hindus
D10 1260  3    and Muslims; neither has the establishment of the State
D10 1270  2    of Israel fostered harmony between Muslims and Jews.
D10 1270 10    #/3,#
D10 1280  1    I turn finally to several theological developments.
D10 1280  8    _1._
D10 1290  1       Theocracy reconsidered. The modern world has been
D10 1290  7    marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine
D10 1300  6    sanction for the state, whatever its political form.
D10 1310  4    The American Constitution was historic at this point
D10 1320  3    in providing that "Congress shall make no law respecting
D10 1330  1    an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
D10 1330  9    exercise thereof". One of our foremost jurists, David
D10 1340  7    Dudley Field, has gone so far as to call this provision
D10 1350  7    "the greatest achievement ever made in the course of
D10 1360  4    human history".
D10 1360  6       The trend throughout the world's religions has been
D10 1370  4    toward a recognition of at least the practical validity
D10 1380  2    of this constitutional enactment. Pakistan was created
D10 1380  9    in 1947 expressly as a Muslim state, but when the army
D10 1390 11    took over eleven years later it did so on a wave of
D10 1400 10    mass impatience which was directed in part against
D10 1410  4    the inability of political and religious leaders to
D10 1410 12    think their way through to the meaning of Islam for
D10 1420 10    the modern political situation. "What is the point",
D10 1430  6    Charles Adams reports the Pakistanis as asking, "in
D10 1440  4    demanding an Islamic state and society if no one, not
D10 1450  3    even the doctors of the sacred law themselves, can
D10 1450 12    say clearly and succinctly what the nature of such
D10 1460  8    a state and society is"? The current regime of President
D10 1470  6    Mohammad Ayub Khan is determinedly secular. And while
D10 1480  4    the nation was formerly named "The Islamic Republic
D10 1490  2    of Pakistan", it is now simply "The Republic of Pakistan".
D10 1500  1       Comparable trends can be noted elsewhere. The new
D10 1500  9    regime in Turkey is intentionally less Muslim than
D10 1510  8    its predecessor. The religious parties in Israel have
D10 1520  6    experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months.
D10 1530  4    During the years when Israel was passing from crisis
D10 1540  2    to crisis- the Sinai campaign, the infusion of multitudes
D10 1540 11    of penniless immigrants- it was felt that the purpose
D10 1550  9    of national unity could be best served if the secular
D10 1560  8    majority were to yield to the religious parties. Now
D10 1570  3    that Israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction
D10 1580  1    of tensions, the secularists are less disposed to compromise.
D10 1590  1    And in this country Gustave Weigel's delineation of
D10 1590  9    the line between the sacral and secular orders during
D10 1600  7    the last presidential campaign served to provide a
D10 1610  5    most impressive Roman Catholic defense of the practical
D10 1620  2    autonomy of both church and state. The failure at that
D10 1620 12    time of the Puerto Rican bishops to control the votes
D10 1630 10    of their people added a ring of good sense to Father
D10 1640  8    Weigel's theological argument. Everywhere there seems
D10 1650  4    to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments
D10 1660  2    and religious institutions alike are too fallible and
D10 1660 10    corruptible- in a word, too human- to warrant any claim
D10 1670 12    of maintaining partnership with the divine.
D10 1680  5    _2._
D10 1680  6       Salvation reconsidered. My father went as a missionary
D10 1690  6    to China in a generation that responded to Student
D10 1700  3    Volunteer Movement speakers who held watches in their
D10 1700 11    hands and announced to the students in their audiences
D10 1710  9    how many Chinese souls were going to hell each second
D10 1720  8    because these students were not over there saving them.
D10 1730  5    That mention of this should bring smiles to our lips
D10 1740  3    today is as clear an indication as we could wish of
D10 1740 14    the extent to which attitudes have changed. I do not
D10 1750  9    mean to imply that Christians have adopted the liberal
D10 1760  5    assumption, so prevalent in Hinduism, that all religions
D10 1770  4    are merely different paths to the same summit. Leslie
D10 1780  1    Newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the
D10 1780  8    World Council of Churches when he says, "We must claim
D10 1790  9    absoluteness and finality for Christ and His finished
D10 1800  6    work, but that very claim forbids us to claim absoluteness
D10 1810  5    and finality for our understanding of it". Newbiggin's
D10 1820  2    qualification on the Christian claim is of considerable
D10 1830  1    significance. The Roman Catholic Church has excommunicated
D10 1830  8    one of its priests, Father Feeney, for insisting that
D10 1840  8    there is no salvation outside the visible church. In
D10 1850  6    mentioning this under "salvation reconsidered" I do
D10 1860  4    not mean to imply that Roman Catholic doctrine has
D10 1870  2    changed in this area but rather that it has become
D10 1870 12    clearer to the world community what that doctrine is.
D11 0010  1    When they say that under no circumstances would it
D11 0010 10    ever be right to "permit" the termination of the human
D11 0020  6    race by human action, because there could not possibly
D11 0030  5    be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a
D11 0040  3    thing, they know exactly what they mean. Of course,
D11 0040 12    in prudential calculation, in balancing the good directly
D11 0050  7    intended and done against the evil unintended and indirectly
D11 0060  6    done, no greater precision can be forthcoming than
D11 0070  4    the subject allows. Yet it seems clear that there can
D11 0080  2    be no good sufficiently great, or evil repelled sufficiently
D11 0080 11    grave, to warrant the destruction of mankind by man's
D11 0090  9    own action.
D11 0100  1       I mean, however, that the moral theologian knows
D11 0100  9    what he means by "permit". He is not talking in the
D11 0110  7    main about probabilities, risks and danger in general.
D11 0120  5    He is talking about an action which just as efficaciously
D11 0130  1    does an evil thing (and is known certainly and unavoidably
D11 0140  1    to lead to this evil result) as it efficaciously does
D11 0140 11    some good. He is talking about double effects, of which
D11 0150  8    the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly
D11 0160  6    the other, but causes both; of which one is deliberately
D11 0170  6    willed or intended and the other not intended or not
D11 0180  3    directly intended, but still both are done, while the
D11 0190  1    evil effect is, with equal consciousness on the part
D11 0190 10    of the agent, foreknown to be among the consequences.
D11 0200  6    This is what, in a technical sense, to "only permit"
D11 0210  4    an evil result means. It means to do it and to know
D11 0220  4    one is doing it, but as only a secondary if certain
D11 0220 15    effect of the good one primarily does and intends.
D11 0230  9    Of course, grave guiltiness may be imputed to the military
D11 0240  7    action of any nation, or to the action of any leader
D11 0250  4    or leaders, which for any supposed good "permits",
D11 0260  1    in this sense, the termination of the human race by
D11 0260 11    human action. Certainly, in analyzing an action which
D11 0270  7    truly faced such alternatives, "it is never possible
D11 0280  5    that no world would be preferable to some worlds, and
D11 0290  4    there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction
D11 0300  2    of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative".
D11 0310  1       Naturally, where one or the other of the effects
D11 0310 10    of an action is uncertain, this has to be taken into
D11 0320  9    account. Especially is this true when, because the
D11 0330  5    good effect is remote and speculative while the evil
D11 0340  3    is certain and grave, the action is prohibited. Presumably,
D11 0350  1    if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more
D11 0350 13    certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming,
D11 0360  7    not only must the good and the evil be prudentially
D11 0370  4    weighed and found proportionate, but also calculation
D11 0380  1    of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty
D11 0380 10    or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken
D11 0390 10    into account. There must not only be greater good than
D11 0400  7    evil objectively in view, but also greater probability
D11 0410  2    of actually doing more good than harm. If an evil which
D11 0420  1    is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be
D11 0420 10    compensated for by a problematic, speculative, future
D11 0430  6    good, by the same token not every present, certain,
D11 0440  3    and immediate good (or lesser evil) that may have to
D11 0450  2    be done will be outweighed by a problematic, speculative,
D11 0450 11    and future evil. Nevertheless, according to the traditional
D11 0460  7    theory, a man begins in the midst of action and he
D11 0470  8    analyzes its nature and immediate cosequences before
D11 0480  2    or while putting it forth and causing these consequences.
D11 0490  1    He does not expect to be able to trammel up all the
D11 0490 13    future consequences of his action. Above all, he does
D11 0500  8    not debate mere contingencies, and therefore, if these
D11 0510  5    are possibly dreadful, find himself forced into inaction.
D11 0520  3    He does what he can and may and must, without regarding
D11 0530  1    himself as lord of the future or, on the other hand,
D11 0530 12    as covered with guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences
D11 0540  7    or by results he did not "permit" in the sense explained.
D11 0550  6    By contrast, a good deal of nuclear pacifism begins
D11 0560  3    with the contingencies and the probabilities, and not
D11 0570  2    with the moral nature of the action to be done; and
D11 0570 13    by deriving legitimate decision backward from whatever
D11 0580  6    may conceivably or possibly or probably result, whether
D11 0590  5    by anyone's doing or by accident, it finds itself driven
D11 0600  5    to inaction, to non-political action in politics and
D11 0610  2    non-military action in military affairs, and to the
D11 0610 11    not very surprising discovery that there are now no
D11 0620  7    distinctions on which the defense of justice can possibly
D11 0630  5    be based.
D11 0630  7       Mr& Philip Toynbee writes, for example, that "in
D11 0640  6    terms of probability it is surely as likely as not
D11 0650  4    that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the
D11 0650 14    near future if the present situation continues. If
D11 0660  8    it continues indefinitely it is nearly a statistical
D11 0670  6    certainty that a mistake will be made and that the
D11 0680  6    devastation will begin". Against such a termination
D11 0690  1    of human life on earth by human action, he then proposes
D11 0690 12    as an alternative that we "negotiate at once with the
D11 0700  9    Russians and get the best terms which are available",
D11 0710  6    that we deliberately "negotiate from comparative weakness".
D11 0720  4    He bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically,
D11 0730  2    i&e&, by considering the worst possible outcome, namely,
D11 0740  2    the total domination of the world by Russia within
D11 0740 11    a few years. This would be by far the better choice,
D11 0750 10    when "it is a question of allowing the human race to
D11 0760  7    survive, possibly under the domination of a regime
D11 0770  4    which most of us detest, or of allowing it to destroy
D11 0780  2    itself in appalling and prolonged anguish". Nevertheless,
D11 0780  9    the consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere
D11 0790  8    subtly qualified: it is "a possible result, however
D11 0800  7    improbable"; "the worst, and least probable" result;
D11 0810  4    "if it didn't prevail mankind would still be given
D11 0820  4    the opportunity of prevailing"; for "surely anything
D11 0830  2    is better than a policy which allows for the possibility
D11 0840  1    of nuclear war". If we have not thought and made a
D11 0840 12    decision entirely in these terms, then we need to submit
D11 0850  9    ourselves to the following "simple test": "Have we
D11 0860  5    decided how we are to kill the other members of our
D11 0870  4    household in the event of our being less injured than
D11 0880  1    they are"? Thus, moral decision must be entirely deduced
D11 0880 10    backward from the likely eventuality; it is no longer
D11 0890  9    to be formulated in terms of the nature of present
D11 0900  6    action itself, its intention, and proximate effect
D11 0910  2    or the thing to be done.
D11 0910  8       Several of the replies to Mr& Toynbee, without conscious
D11 0920  6    resort to the traditional terminology with regard to
D11 0930  4    the permission of evil, succeed in restoring the actual
D11 0940  2    context in which present moral and political decisions
D11 0940 10    must be made, by distinguishing between choosing a
D11 0950  7    great evil and choosing in danger of this evil. "It
D11 0960  6    is worse for a nation to give in to evil **h than to
D11 0970  4    run the risk of annihilation". "I am consciously prepared
D11 0980  1    to run the continued risk of 'race suicide by accident'
D11 0980 11    rather than accept the alternative certainty of race
D11 0990  8    slavery by design. But I can only make this choice
D11 1000  7    because I believe that the risk need not increase,
D11 1010  3    but may be deliberately reduced" [by precautions against
D11 1020  1    accidents or by limiting war?] "Quoting Mr& Kennan's
D11 1030  1    phrase that anything would be better than a policy
D11 1030 10    which led inevitably to nuclear war, he [Toynbee] says
D11 1040  7    that anything is better than a policy which allows
D11 1050  4    for the possibility of nuclear war". "If asked to choose
D11 1060  4    between a terrible probability and a more terrible
D11 1060 12    possibility, most men will choose the latter". "If
D11 1070  8    **h Philip Toynbee is claiming that the choice lies
D11 1080  7    between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war, I
D11 1090  5    think he is right. I do not accept that the choice
D11 1100  1    is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear
D11 1100  9    war". Even Professor Arnold Toynbee, agreeing with
D11 1110  6    his son, does so in these terms: "Compared to continuing
D11 1120  5    to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the
D11 1130  5    human race, all other evils are lesser evils **h. Let
D11 1140  2    us therefore put first things first, and make sure
D11 1140 11    of preserving the human race at whatever the temporary
D11 1150  8    price may be".
D11 1160  1       Mr& Philip Toynbee affirms at one point that if
D11 1160  9    he shared the anticipations of Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-Four,
D11 1170  8    if he believed Communism was not only evil but "also
D11 1180  8    irredeemably evil", then he might "think it right to
D11 1190  7    do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist
D11 1200  5    world. Even a nuclear holocaust is a little less frightful
D11 1210  2    to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying
D11 1210 11    the earth until doomsday". No political order or economic
D11 1220  9    system is so clearly contrary to nature. But one does
D11 1230  9    not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable
D11 1240  6    in that sense, or a static order in which no changes
D11 1250  5    will take place in time, to be able truthfully to affirm
D11 1260  2    the following fact: there has never been justitia imprinted
D11 1270  1    in social institutions and social relationships except
D11 1270  8    in the context of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed
D11 1280  8    or naked force. On their way to the Heavenly City the
D11 1290  7    children of God make use of the pax-ordo of the earthly
D11 1300  4    city and acknowledge their share in responsibility
D11 1310  1    for its preservation. Not to repel injury and uphold
D11 1310 10    and improve pax-ordo means not simply to accept the
D11 1320  9    misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at
D11 1330  5    the moment, but also to start down the steep slope
D11 1340  2    along which justice can find no place whereon to stand.
D11 1340 12    Toynbee seems to think that there is some other way
D11 1350 10    to give justice social embodiment. "I would far rather
D11 1360  6    die after a Russian occupation of this country- by
D11 1370  4    some deliberate act of refusal- than die uselessly
D11 1380  1    by atomisation". Would such an act of refusal be useful?
D11 1380 11    He does not mean, in fact he addresses himself specifically
D11 1390  9    to reject the proposition, that "if we took the risk
D11 1400  8    of surrendering, a new generation in Britain would
D11 1410  4    soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order
D11 1420  1    to reverse the consequences of that surrender". He
D11 1420  9    wants to be "brutally frank and say that these rebellions
D11 1430  8    would be hopeless- far, far more hopeless than was
D11 1440  9    the Hungarian revolution of 1956". This is not a project
D11 1450  6    for regaining the ground for limited war, by creating
D11 1460  2    a monopoly in one power of the world's arsenal of unlimited
D11 1470  1    weapons. It is a proposal that justice now be served
D11 1470 11    by means other than those that have ever preconditioned
D11 1480  7    the search for it, or preconditioned more positive
D11 1490  3    means for attaining it, in the past. "It is no good
D11 1500  3    recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare
D11 1500  9    with the proviso that surrender could be followed by
D11 1510  7    the effective military resistance by occupied peoples.
D11 1520  4    Hope for the future **h would lie in the natural longing
D11 1530  3    of the human race for freedom and the right to develop".
D11 1540  1    This is to surrender in advance to whatever attack
D11 1540 10    may yet be mounted, to the very last; it is to stride
D11 1550  9    along the steep slope downward. The only contrary action,
D11 1560  5    in the future as in the past, runs the risk of war;
D11 1570  4    and, now and in the future unlike in the past, any
D11 1580  1    attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular
D11 1580 10    civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional
D11 1590  6    justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger
D11 1600  5    that an effect of it will, by human action, render
D11 1610  1    this planet less habitable by the human race. That
D11 1610 10    is why it is so very important that ethical analysis
D11 1620  7    keep clear the problem of decision as to "permitted"
D11 1630  4    effects, and not draw back in fright from any conceivable
D11 1640  3    contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities
D11 1650  1    or probabilities unrelated, or not directly morally
D11 1650  8    related, to what we can and may and must do as long
D11 1660 12    as human history endures.
D11 1670  1       Finally, just as no different issues are posed for
D11 1670 10    thoughtful analysis by the foreshortening of time that
D11 1680  8    may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth,
D11 1690  7    but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination,
D11 1700  1    the same thing must be said in connection with the
D11 1700 11    question of what we may perhaps already be doing, by
D11 1710 10    human action, to accelerate this end. We should not
D11 1720  6    allow the image of an immanent end brought about indirectly
D11 1730  3    by our own action in the continuing human struggle
D11 1740  1    for a just endurable order of existence to blind us
D11 1740 11    to the fact that in some measure accelerating the end
D11 1750  7    of our lease may be one consequence among others of
D11 1760  4    many other of mankind's thrusts toward we know not
D11 1770  2    what future.
D12 0010  1       MUCH MORE than shelter, housing symbolizes social
D12 0010  8    status, a sense of "belonging", acceptance within a
D12 0020  8    given group or neighborhood, identification with particular
D12 0030  4    cultural values and social institutions, feelings of
D12 0040  3    pride and worth, aspirations and hopes basic to human
D12 0050  2    well-being. For almost one-sixth of the national population
D12 0050 12    discrimination in the free selection of residence casts
D12 0060  8    a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as
D12 0070  6    self-evident by most Americans.
D12 0080  1       Few business groups in recent years have come under
D12 0080 10    heavier pressure to face these realities than real
D12 0090  7    estate brokers and home builders. This pressure has
D12 0100  4    urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying their
D12 0110  2    professional ethics; it has sought new sympathy for
D12 0110 10    the human aspirations of racial minority groups in
D12 0120  7    this country. It is not surprising that, as spokesman
D12 0130  4    for real estate interests, the National Association
D12 0140  1    of Real Estate Boards (~NAREB) and its local associations
D12 0150  1    have sought to limit and often ignore much of this
D12 0150 11    pressure.
D12 0160  1       How does the local realtor see himself in the context
D12 0160 11    of housing restrictions based on race, religion or
D12 0170  7    ethnic attachment? What does he conceive his role to
D12 0180  7    be in this area of social unrest? What ought to be,
D12 0190  4    what is his potential role as a force for constructive
D12 0190 14    social change? What social, ethical and theological
D12 0200  7    insights can the church and university help him bring
D12 0210  7    to bear upon his situation?
D12 0220  1       Recently, a group of the faculty at Wesleyan University's
D12 0220 10    Public Affairs Center sought some answers to these
D12 0230  8    questions. Several New England realtors were invited
D12 0240  6    to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers,
D12 0250  4    political scientists, economists, social psychologists,
D12 0260  1    social ethicists and theologians. Here, in an atmosphere
D12 0270  1    of forthrightness and mutual criticism, each sought
D12 0270  8    to bring his particular insights to bear upon the question
D12 0280  7    of discrimination in housing and the part each man
D12 0290  6    present played in it.
D12 0290 10       For a number of years, Wesleyan has been drawing
D12 0300  5    varied groups of political and business leaders into
D12 0310  3    these informal discussions with members of the faculty
D12 0320  1    and student body, attempting to explore and clarify
D12 0320  9    aspects of their responsibility for public policy.
D12 0330  5    This article presents our observations of that session,
D12 0340  4    of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty
D12 0350  2    and students saw them.
D12 0350  6       Such conversation quickly reveals an ethically significant
D12 0360  4    ambivalence in the self-images held by most realtors.
D12 0370  2    Within the membership of this group, as has been found
D12 0370 12    true of men in other professional or trade associations,
D12 0380  9    the most ready portrayal of oneself to "the public"
D12 0390  7    is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests
D12 0400  4    of a seller or buyer and mediating between them. Professional
D12 0410  3    responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving
D12 0420  1    the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient
D12 0420 11    manner. But as conversation goes on, particularly among
D12 0430  6    the realtors themselves, another image emerges, that
D12 0440  4    of considerable power and influence in the community.
D12 0450  1    Obviously, much more than customer expectation is determining
D12 0460  1    the realtor's role. Judgments are continually rendered
D12 0460  8    regarding the potential buyers' income, educational
D12 0470  6    level and above all, racial extraction; and whether
D12 0480  4    these would qualify them for "congenial", "happy" relations
D12 0490  3    to other people in certain community areas.
D12 0500  1    #A NARROW PROFESSIONALISM#
D12 0500  4    How explicit such factors have been historically is
D12 0510  3    evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases
D12 0520  1    or in a review of ~NAREB's Code of Ethics Article 34
D12 0520 12    in the Code, adopted in 1924, states that "a Realtor
D12 0530 10    should never be instrumental in introducing into a
D12 0540  6    neighborhood a character of property or occupancy,
D12 0550  3    members of any race or nationality, or any individuals
D12 0560  1    whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property
D12 0560  9    values in that neighborhood". Though the reference
D12 0570  5    to race was stricken by the association in 1950, being
D12 0580  4    an agent of such "detrimental" influences still appears
D12 0590  3    as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed
D12 0590 11    to avoid.
D12 0600  2       The rationale for this avoidance was most frequently
D12 0610  1    expressed in economic terms; all feared the supposed
D12 0610  9    stigma they believed would inevitably attach to any
D12 0620  6    realtor who openly introduced non-white, particularly
D12 0630  2    Negro, peoples into all-white, restricted areas. They
D12 0640  2    would become tagged as men not interested in being
D12 0640 11    purely real estate "professionals" but agitators for
D12 0650  6    some kind of "cause" or "reform", and this was no longer
D12 0660  8    to be a "pro".
D12 0660 12       Obviously what we are confronted with here is the
D12 0670  9    identification of "professional" with narrow skills
D12 0680  4    and specialization, the effective servicing of a client,
D12 0690  4    rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper
D12 0700  1    meaning and associations of one's work. These men-
D12 0700  9    for the most part educated in our "best" New England
D12 0710  8    colleges, well established financially and socially
D12 0720  4    in the community- under kindly but insistent probing,
D12 0730  2    reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria
D12 0730 10    or data for their generalizations about the interests
D12 0740  7    and attitudes of the people they claim to serve, or
D12 0750  7    about the public responses that actually follow their
D12 0760  3    occasional breach of a "client-service relationship".
D12 0770  1       This narrow "professionalism" does not even fit
D12 0770  8    the present realities of their situation, as the pressure
D12 0780  8    of minorities and the power and respectability of the
D12 0790  6    realtors increase. As our discussion continued, the
D12 0800  3    inadequacy of the "client relationship" as an interpretation
D12 0810  1    of their "way of operating" became evident. Realtors
D12 0820  1    live in their communities as specialists in a given
D12 0820 10    area of work, as members of social and professional
D12 0830  6    organizations, as citizens and civic leaders, as church
D12 0840  4    laymen, as university alumni, as newspaper readers,
D12 0850  1    etc&. From such communal roles the realtor finds the
D12 0860  9    substance that shapes his moral understanding.
D12 0870  5       It seems to us that choices exercised by realtors
D12 0880  3    in moral situations center in at least three areas:
D12 0890  1    (1) the various ways in which they interpret a particular
D12 0890 11    social issue; (2) their pattern of involvement in the
D12 0900  9    regular legal and political processes; and, most pervasively,
D12 0910  5    (3) their interpretation of who is a "real pro", of
D12 0920  7    what it means to be a professional man in a technical,
D12 0930  3    fragmented society.
D12 0930  5       (1) Most of the realtors minimized their own understanding
D12 0940  4    of and role in the racial issue, pleading that they
D12 0950  3    only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their
D12 0950 11    society. There is some reality to this; the Commission
D12 0960  9    on Race and Housing concluded that "there is no reason
D12 0970  7    to believe that real estate men are either more or
D12 0980  6    less racially prejudiced, on the whole, than any other
D12 0990  2    segment of the American population". But such a reaction
D12 0990 11    obscures the powerful efforts made in the past by both
D12 1000 10    ~NAREB and its local boards for the maintenance of
D12 1010  8    restrictive clauses and practices. Also, it does not
D12 1020  5    recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually
D12 1030  2    employed.
D12 1030  3       Like business and university groups generally, these
D12 1040  2    men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological
D12 1040 10    and psychological studies and findings that might illumine
D12 1050  8    the decisions they make. Realtors, both generally and
D12 1060  7    in this group, have invariably equated residential
D12 1070  3    integration with a decline in property values, a circumstance
D12 1080  3    viewed with considerable apprehension.
D12 1080  7       Recent studies by the Commission on Race and Housing
D12 1090  9    and others, however, point to a vast complex of factors
D12 1100  8    that often do not warrant this conclusion. There are
D12 1110  3    increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated
D12 1120  1    residentially without great loss of property values,
D12 1120  8    the white population having taken the initiative in
D12 1130  6    preparing the areas for an appreciation of the Negroes'
D12 1140  4    desire for well-kept housing, privacy, etc&. Data on
D12 1150  3    the decline of property values in an area after a new
D12 1150 14    racial group enters it has to be assessed in terms
D12 1160 10    of the trends in property values before the group comes
D12 1170  6    in. Often they are able to get in only because the
D12 1180  4    area is declining economically.
D12 1180  8       Significantly, no realtor and few of the faculty
D12 1190  8    present were familiar with any of the six volumes (published
D12 1200  5    by the University of California Press) that present
D12 1210  3    the commission's findings. No one anticipates any radical
D12 1220  1    shift in this situation, but questions concerning reading
D12 1220  9    habits, the availability of such data and the places
D12 1230  9    where it is discussed must surely be raised. The role
D12 1240  6    of both church and university as sources of information
D12 1250  3    and settings within which the implications of such
D12 1250 11    information may be explored needs consideration.
D12 1260  6       Relevant "facts", however, extend beyond considerations
D12 1270  4    of property values and maintenance of "harmonious"
D12 1280  3    neighborhoods. Discussion of minority housing necessarily
D12 1290  1    involves such basic issues as the intensity of one's
D12 1290 10    democratic conviction and religious belief concerning
D12 1300  6    equality of opportunity, the function and limitations
D12 1310  5    of government in the securing of such equality, and
D12 1320  3    the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents
D12 1330  1    of racial agitation and strife.
D12 1330  6    #"AGAINST THE GRAIN OF CREATION"#
D12 1340  1    (2) Realtors realize, of course, that they are involved
D12 1340 10    in an increasingly complex legal and political system
D12 1350  7    that is opening up opportunities for leverage on their
D12 1360  5    relation to clients as well as opportunities for evasion
D12 1370  3    of their responsibility for racial discrimination in
D12 1380  2    housing. On the positive side, recent Federal action
D12 1380 10    has largely undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed
D12 1390  8    by the segregationist position; anti-discriminatory
D12 1400  3    statutes in housing have now been adopted by thirteen
D12 1410  3    states and, while specific provisions have varied,
D12 1410 10    the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage.
D12 1420  7       Realtors in attendance at the colloquium expressed
D12 1430  5    interest, for example, in Connecticut's new housing
D12 1440  3    law as setting standards of equity that they would
D12 1450  1    like "to have to obey", but in support of which none
D12 1450 12    had been willing to go on public record. As far as
D12 1460  9    they were aware, the Connecticut Association of Real
D12 1470  4    Estate Boards had not officially opposed the bill's
D12 1480  3    passage or lobbied in its support. (This has not been
D12 1480 13    the case everywhere. In 1957, the Real Estate Boards
D12 1490  9    of New York City actively opposed the then pending
D12 1500  6    private housing anti-discrimination law. Official reasoning:
D12 1510  4    the bill was a "wanton invasion of basic property rights".)
D12 1520  5       There are sins of omission as well as commission;
D12 1530  4    the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations,
D12 1540  1    either negative or positive, plays a large part in
D12 1540 10    the public acceptance of such measures and the degree
D12 1550  8    to which they may be effectively enforced. Judicial
D12 1560  3    opinion since the Supreme Court decision on Shelley
D12 1570  3    v& Kraemer (1948) has rendered racial restrictive covenants
D12 1580  2    unenforcible. Such a decision should have placed a
D12 1580 10    powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing
D12 1590  9    industry, but there is little evidence that realtors,
D12 1600  4    or at least their associations, have repudiated the
D12 1610  2    principle in such clauses.
D12 1610  6       In the states that have passed laws preventing discrimination
D12 1620  4    in the sale or rental of housing, support by real estate
D12 1630  5    associations for compliance and broadened coverage
D12 1640  1    through additional legislation could help remove the
D12 1640  8    label of "social reformism" that most realtors individually
D12 1650  6    seem determined to avoid. But as yet, no real estate
D12 1660  8    board has been willing officially to support such laws
D12 1670  5    or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority
D12 1680  1    buyers into all-white neighborhoods.
D12 1680  6       One of the roles of the social scientist, ethicist
D12 1690  5    or theologian in our discussions with the realtors
D12 1700  3    became that of encouraging greater awareness of the
D12 1700 11    opportunities offered by the legal and political processes
D12 1710  8    for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in
D12 1730  6    their work. But responsiveness to these opportunities
D12 1740  3    presumes that all of us judge the good as a human good
D12 1750  2    and not simply as a professional, white, American good.
D12 1750 11    Such judgments are meaningful only in so far as persons
D12 1770  6    are members of a world, let us say a community, that
D12 1780  7    embraces Scarsdale or Yonkers, but is also infinitely
D12 1790  3    richer since it is all-inclusive.
D12 1790  9       That community of all creation is, then, the ultimate
D12 1800  8    object of our loyalty and the concrete norm of all
D12 1810  6    moral judgment. Racial discrimination is wrong, then,
D12 1820  2    not because it goes against the grain of a faculty
D12 1820 12    member trying to converse with a few realtors but because
D12 1830  9    it goes against the grain of creation and against the
D12 1840  7    will of the Creator. Thus, moral issues concerning
D12 1850  2    the nature of the legal and political processes take
D12 1860  1    on theological dimensions.
D12 1860  4    #A FRAGMENTED SOCIETY#
D12 1860  7    (3) Over the years, individuals engaged in the sale
D12 1870  6    of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the
D12 1880  4    methods and practices employed. Most realtors and real
D12 1890  2    estate brokers talk of themselves as "professional
D12 1890  9    people" with the cultural and moral values held by
D12 1900  9    the traditional professions. But what significance
D12 1910  4    attaches to "professional", beyond the narrow sense
D12 1920  2    of skillfulness in meeting a client's stated needs
D12 1920 10    as already noted? Our faculty and students pressed
D12 1930  7    this issue more than any other.
D12 1940  3       As a theologian in the group pointed out, a professional
D12 1950  1    was, before the modern period of technical specialization,
D12 1950  9    one who "professed" to be a bearer and critic of his
D12 1960 10    culture in the use of his particular skills.
D13 0010  1       If we look about the world today, we can see clearly
D13 0010 12    that there are two especially significant factors shaping
D13 0020  7    the future of our civilization: science and religion.
D13 0030  4    Science is placing in our hands the ultimate power
D13 0040  5    of the universe, the power of the atom. Religion, or
D13 0050  2    the lack of it, will decide whether we use this power
D13 0050 13    to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for
D13 0060 10    all mankind, or whether we misuse this power to leave
D13 0070  7    a world utterly destroyed. How can we have the wisdom
D13 0080  4    to meet such a new and difficult challenge?
D13 0090  1       We may feel pessimistic at the outlook. And yet
D13 0090  9    there is a note of hope, because this same science
D13 0110  5    that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving
D13 0120  3    us atomic vision. We are looking inside the atom and
D13 0120 13    seeing there a universe which is not material but something
D13 0130 10    beyond the material, a universe that in a word is not
D13 0140  9    matter but music. And it is in this new vision of the
D13 0150  7    atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration
D13 0160  1    of our faith.
D13 0160  4    #ATOMIC ENERGY#
D13 0160  6    To see this vision in perspective, we need first of
D13 0170  5    all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power
D13 0180  2    from the atom. You know that I could hold right here
D13 0180 13    in my hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was
D13 0190 10    the heart of the bomb that dropped on Hiroshima. It
D13 0200  6    was only about the size of a baseball; but packed in
D13 0210  4    that metallic ball there was the explosive force of
D13 0220  1    20,000 tons of ~TNT. That is enough ~TNT to fill the
D13 0220 12    tower of the Empire State Building; and with the availability
D13 0230 10    of bombs of that size, war became a new problem.
D13 0240  9       Now we might have restricted the use of uranium
D13 0250  5    bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because
D13 0260  2    it is found in only a few places in the world. But
D13 0260 14    we had hardly started to adjust our thinking to this
D13 0270  8    new uranium weapon when we were faced with the hydrogen
D13 0280  6    bomb. Hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce.
D13 0290  4    We know that we have hydrogen in water; water is **f
D13 0300  2    and the ~H stands for hydrogen; there is also hydrogen
D13 0300 12    in wood and hydrogen in our bodies. I have calculated
D13 0310  9    that if I could snap my fingers in one magic gesture
D13 0320  7    to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body,
D13 0330  4    I would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of
D13 0340  1    the kind that fell on Hiroshima. I won't try the experiment,
D13 0340 12    but I think you can see that if we all knew the secret
D13 0350 13    and we could all let ourselves go, there would be quite
D13 0360  7    an explosion. And then think how little hydrogen we
D13 0370  4    have in us compared with the hydrogen in Delaware Bay
D13 0380  2    or in the ocean beyond. Salt water is still **f, the
D13 0380 13    same hydrogen is there. And the size of the ocean shows
D13 0390 10    us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in
D13 0400  6    our hands today.
D13 0400  9       Of course, there is also an optimistic side to the
D13 0410  8    picture. For if I knew the secret of letting this power
D13 0420  5    in my body change directly into electricity, I could
D13 0430  3    rent myself out to the electric companies and with
D13 0430 12    just the power in my body I could light all the lights
D13 0440 10    and run all the factories in the entire United States
D13 0450  6    for some days. And think, if we all knew this secret
D13 0460  3    and we could pool our power, what a wonderful public
D13 0460 13    utility company we would make. With just the hydrogen
D13 0470  9    of our bodies, we could run the world for years. Then
D13 0480  8    think of Delaware Bay and the ocean and you see that
D13 0490  6    we have a supply of power for millions of years to
D13 0500  2    come. It is power with which we can literally rebuild
D13 0500 12    the world, provide adequate housing, food, education,
D13 0510  6    abundant living for everyone everywhere.
D13 0520  2    #AN OCTILLION ATOMS#
D13 0520  5    Now let us see where this power comes from. To grasp
D13 0530  5    our new view of the atom, we have to appreciate first
D13 0540  2    of all how small the atom is. I have been trying to
D13 0540 14    make this clear to my own class in chemistry. One night
D13 0550 10    there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table,
D13 0560  7    and these peas looked to me like a little group of
D13 0570  3    atoms; and I asked myself a question: Suppose I had
D13 0580  2    the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body,
D13 0580 14    how large an area would they cover?
D13 0590  5       I calculated first that there are about an octillion
D13 0600  4    atoms in the average human body; that is a figure one
D13 0610  2    with 27 ciphers, quite a large number. Then I calculated
D13 0610 12    that a million peas would just about fill a household
D13 0620  9    refrigerator; a billion peas would fill a small house
D13 0630  7    from cellar to attic; a trillion peas would fill all
D13 0640  4    the houses in a town of about ten thousand people;
D13 0650  1    and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings
D13 0650 10    in the city of Philadelphia.
D13 0660  1       I saw that I would soon run out of buildings at
D13 0670  1    this rate, so I decided to take another measure- the
D13 0670 11    whole state of Pennsylvania. Imagine that there is
D13 0680  6    a blizzard over Pennsylvania, but instead of snowing
D13 0690  5    snow, it snows peas; so we get the whole state covered
D13 0700  2    with peas, about four feet deep. You can imagine what
D13 0700 12    it would look like going out on the turnpike with the
D13 0710 10    peas banked up against the houses and covering the
D13 0720  6    cars; Pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about
D13 0730  3    a quintillion peas.
D13 0730  6       But we still have a long way to go. Next we imagine
D13 0740  7    our blizzard raging over all the land areas of the
D13 0750  3    entire globe- North America, South America, Europe,
D13 0750 10    Asia, and Africa, all covered with peas four feet deep;
D13 0760 10    then we have sextillion peas. Next we freeze over the
D13 0770  8    oceans and cover the whole earth with peas, then we
D13 0780  6    go out among the neighboring stars, collect 250 planets
D13 0790  3    each the size of the earth, and also cover each of
D13 0790 14    these with peas four feet deep; and then we have septillion.
D13 0800 11    Finally we go into the farthest reaches of the Milky
D13 0810  9    Way; we get 250,000 planets; we cover each of these
D13 0820  6    with our blanket of peas and then at last we have octillion
D13 0830  4    peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body.
D13 0840  1    So you see how small an atom is and how complicated
D13 0840 12    you are.
D13 0840 14    #A SPECK- AND SPACE#
D13 0850  3    Now although an atom is small, we can still in imagination
D13 0860  2    have a look at it. Let us focus on an atom of calcium
D13 0860 15    from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose
D13 0870 13    that I swallow a magic Alice in Wonderland growing
D13 0880  7    pill. I start growing rapidly and this calcium atom
D13 0890  5    grows along with me. I shoot up through the roof, into
D13 0900  3    the sky, past the clouds, through the stratosphere,
D13 0900 11    out beyond the moon, out among the planets, until I
D13 0910  9    am over a hundred and fifty million miles long. Then
D13 0920  6    this atom of calcium will swell to something like a
D13 0930  3    great balloon a hundred yards across, a balloon big
D13 0930 12    enough to put a football field inside. And if you should
D13 0940 11    step inside of such a magnified atom, according to
D13 0950  6    the physics of forty years ago, you would see circulating
D13 0960  4    over your head, down at the sides, and under your feet,
D13 0970  2    some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs.
D13 0970 11    These balls are moving in great circles and ellipses,
D13 0980  9    and are of course, the electrons, the particles of
D13 0990  5    negative electricity which by their action create the
D13 1000  3    forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring
D13 1010  1    atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of
D13 1010 11    my finger bone.
D13 1020  1       Since these electrons are moving like planets, you
D13 1020  9    may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center
D13 1030  9    of the atom. So you look down there and you see a tiny,
D13 1040  7    whirling point about the size of the head of a pin.
D13 1050  4    This is the atomic sun, the atomic nucleus. Even if
D13 1050 14    the atom were big enough to hold a football field,
D13 1060 10    this nucleus is still only about the size of a pinhead.
D13 1070  8    It is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive
D13 1080  3    charge of electricity holding these negatively charged
D13 1090  1    electrons in their orbits; it also contains nearly
D13 1090  9    all the mass, and the atomic energy.
D13 1100  5       You may ask what else there is, and the answer is
D13 1110  3    nothing- nothing but empty space. And since you are
D13 1110 12    made of atoms, you are nothing much but empty space,
D13 1120 10    too. If I could put your body in an imaginary atomic
D13 1130  7    press and squeeze you down, squeeze these holes out
D13 1140  4    of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge,
D13 1150  1    you would get smaller and smaller until finally when
D13 1150 10    the last hole was gone, you would be smaller than the
D13 1160  9    smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece
D13 1170  6    of paper. Someone has remarked that this is certainly
D13 1180  2    the ultimate in reducing. At any rate, it shows us
D13 1180 12    how immaterial we are.
D13 1190  3    #MUSIC OF THE SPHERES#
D13 1190  7    Now this 1920 view of the atom was on the whole a discouraging
D13 1200  8    picture. For we believed that the electrons obeyed
D13 1220  2    the law of mechanics and electrodynamics; and therefore
D13 1230  1    the atom was really just a little machine; and in mechanics
D13 1230 12    the whole is no more than the sum of the parts. So
D13 1240 12    if you are made of atoms, you are just a big machine;
D13 1250  8    and since the universe is also made of atoms, it is
D13 1260  5    just a supermachine. And this would mean that we live
D13 1270  2    in a mechanistic universe, governed by the laws of
D13 1270 11    cause and effect, bound in chains of determinism that
D13 1280  7    hold the universe on a completely predetermined course
D13 1290  3    in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human
D13 1300  3    freedom. And this is why so many scientists a half
D13 1300 13    a century ago were agnostics or atheists.
D13 1310  6       Then came the scientific revolution in the late
D13 1320  4    1920's. A suggestion from Louis de Broglie, a physicist
D13 1330  2    in France, showed us that these electrons are not point
D13 1330 12    particles but waves. And to see the meaning of this
D13 1340 10    new picture, imagine that you can put on more powerful
D13 1350  8    glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look
D13 1360  5    at it in the way we view it today. Now as you step
D13 1370  1    inside, instead of seeing particles orbiting around
D13 1370  8    like planets, you see waves and ripples very much like
D13 1380  8    the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when
D13 1390  5    you drop a stone into it. These ripples spread out
D13 1400  2    in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a
D13 1400 11    great cathedral. And as the waves flow back and forth
D13 1410  9    and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms,
D13 1420  4    you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music.
D13 1430  2    It is a music like the music from a great organ or
D13 1430 14    a vast orchestra playing a symphony. Harmony, melody,
D13 1440  6    counterpoint symphonic structure are there; and as
D13 1450  5    this music ebbs and flows, there is an antiphonal chorus
D13 1460  2    from all the atoms outside, in fact from the atoms
D13 1460 12    of the entire universe. And so today when we examine
D13 1470 10    the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the
D13 1480  8    universe, we are forced to conclude that the best word
D13 1490  5    to describe our universe is music.
D13 1500  1       The Island of Nantucket, part of the State of Massachusetts,
D13 1510  1    lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother
D13 1510 10    State. Some of the Island is sand and is not suitable
D13 1520  9    for living. The Island folk have their living almost
D13 1530  5    entirely from summer visitors; the rest is obtained
D13 1540  2    from harbor scallops. During about three and a half
D13 1540 11    months of the year, in the summer, there are three
D13 1550 10    boats that run from the mainland to the Island carrying
D13 1560  5    passengers, food, and cars; but the rest of the year
D13 1570  5    only one boat is needed, which ties up at the mainland
D13 1580  1    nights and makes the trip down to Nantucket in the
D13 1580 11    daytime. This is a fine trip, too, on a good day. With
D13 1590 11    Martha's Vineyard on one side and the open sea on the
D13 1600  8    other, it makes an excellent trip of about three hours.
D14 0010  1       TO WHAT extent and in what ways did Christianity
D14 0010 10    affect the United States of America in the nineteenth
D14 0020  9    century? How far and in what fashion did it modify
D14 0030  8    the new nation which was emerging in the midst of the
D14 0040  6    forces shaping the revolutionary age? To what extent
D14 0050  2    did it mould the morals and the social, economic, and
D14 0050 12    political life and institutions of the country?
D14 0060  7       A complete picture is impossible- partly because
D14 0070  3    of the limitations of space, partly because for millions
D14 0080  3    of individuals who professed allegiance to the Christian
D14 0090  1    faith data are unobtainable. Even more of an obstacle
D14 0090 10    is the difficulty of separating the influence of Christianity
D14 0100  7    from other factors.
D14 0110  1       Although a complete picture cannot be given, we
D14 0110  9    can indicate some aspects of life into which the Christian
D14 0120  9    faith entered as at least one creative factor. At times
D14 0130  7    we can say that it was the major factor.
D14 0140  2       What in some ways was the most important aspect
D14 0140 11    was the impact individually on the millions who constituted
D14 0150  8    the nation. As we have seen, a growing proportion,
D14 0160  7    although in 1914 still a minority, were members of
D14 0170  4    churches. Presumably those who did not have a formal
D14 0180  1    church connexion had also felt the influence of Christianity
D14 0180 10    to a greater or less extent. Many of them had once
D14 0190  9    been members of a church or at least had been given
D14 0200  7    instruction in Christianity but for one or another
D14 0210  2    reason had allowed the connexion to lapse. The form
D14 0210 11    of Christianity to which they were exposed was for
D14 0220  8    some the Protestantism of the older stock, for others
D14 0230  6    the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration;
D14 0240  2    for still others, mostly of the nineteenth-century
D14 0250  1    immigration, it was Roman Catholicism, and for a small
D14 0250 10    minority it was Eastern Orthodoxy. Upon all of them
D14 0260  7    played the intellectual, social, political, and economic
D14 0270  4    attitudes, institutions, and customs of the nation.
D14 0280  2    Upon most of these Christianity had left an impress
D14 0280 11    and through them had had a share in making the individual
D14 0290 10    what he was. Yet to determine precisely to what extent
D14 0300  7    and exactly in what ways any individual showed the
D14 0310  3    effects of Christianity would be impossible. At best
D14 0320  2    only an approximation could be arrived at. To generalize
D14 0320 11    for the entire nation would be absurd. For instance,
D14 0330  8    we cannot know whether even for church members the
D14 0340  6    degree of conformity to Christian standards of morality
D14 0350  3    increased or declined as the proportion of church members
D14 0360  1    in the population rose. The temptation is to say that,
D14 0360 11    as the percentage of church members mounted, the degree
D14 0370  7    of discipline exercised by the churches lessened and
D14 0380  6    the trend was towards conformity to the general level.
D14 0390  2    Yet this cannot be proved. We know that in the early
D14 0390 13    part of the century many Protestant congregations took
D14 0400  8    positive action against members who transgressed the
D14 0410  6    ethical codes to which the majority subscribed. Thus
D14 0420  3    Baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance of
D14 0430  2    charges against their members of drunkenness, fighting,
D14 0430  9    malicious gossip, lying, cheating, sexual irregularities,
D14 0440  6    gambling, horse racing, and failure to pay just debts.
D14 0450  7    If guilty, the offender might be excluded from membership.
D14 0460  3    As church membership burgeoned, such measures faded
D14 0470  2    into desuetude. But whether this was accompanied by
D14 0470 10    a general lowering of the moral life of the membership
D14 0480  9    we do not know.
D14 0480 13       What we can attempt with some hope of dependable
D14 0490  9    conclusions is to point out the manner in which Christianity
D14 0500  7    entered into particular aspects of the life of the
D14 0510  6    nation. We have already hinted at the fashion in which
D14 0520  2    Christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual
D14 0520 10    life. We will now speak of the ways in which it helped
D14 0530 12    shape the ideals of the country and of the manner in
D14 0540  9    which it stimulated efforts to attain those ideals
D14 0550  3    through reform movements, through programmes for bringing
D14 0560  1    the collective life to the nation to conformity to
D14 0560 10    Christian standards, and through leaders in the government.
D14 0570  7       Throughout the nineteenth century Christianity exerted
D14 0580  5    its influence on American society as a whole primarily
D14 0590  6    through the Protestantism of the older stock. By the
D14 0600  3    end of the century the Roman Catholic Church was beginning
D14 0610  1    to make itself felt, mainly through such institutions
D14 0610  9    as hospitals but also through its attitude towards
D14 0620  7    organized labour. In the twentieth century its influence
D14 0630  4    grew, as did that of the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century
D14 0640  4    immigration.
D14 0640  5    #THE AMERICAN DREAM#
D14 0640  8    The ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the
D14 0650  9    Protestantism of the older stock. Thus "America", the
D14 0660  6    most widely sung of the patriotic songs, was written
D14 0670  4    by a New England Baptist clergyman, Samuel Francis
D14 0680  1    Smith (1808-1895), while a student in Andover Theological
D14 0690  1    Seminary. With its zeal for liberty and its dependence
D14 0690 10    on God it breathed the spirit which had been nourished
D14 0700  8    on the Evangelical revivals. The great seal of the
D14 0710  6    United States was obviously inspired by the Christian
D14 0720  3    faith. Here was what was called the American dream,
D14 0720 12    namely, the effort to build a structure which would
D14 0730  9    be something new in history and to do so in such fashion
D14 0740  9    that God could bless it. Later in the century the dream
D14 0750  6    again found expression in the lines of Katherine Lee
D14 0760  2    Bates (1859-1929), daughter and granddaughter of New
D14 0760 10    England Congregational ministers, in her widely sung
D14 0770  7    hymn, written in 1893, "America the Beautiful", with
D14 0780  6    the words "O beautiful for pilgrim feet whose stern
D14 0790  6    impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom beat
D14 0800  2    across the wilderness. America, America, God mend thy
D14 0810  2    every flaw, confirm thy soul in self control, thy liberty
D14 0810 12    in law **h. O beautiful for patriot dream that sees
D14 0820  9    beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed
D14 0830  5    by human tears. America, America, God shed His grace
D14 0840  5    on thee, and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea
D14 0850  2    to shining sea".
D14 0850  5       The American dream was compounded of many strains.
D14 0860  3    Some were clearly of Christian origin, among them the
D14 0870  1    Great Awakening and other revivals which helped to
D14 0870  9    make Christian liberty, Christian equality, and Christian
D14 0880  6    fraternity the passion of the land. Some have seen
D14 0890  6    revivalism and the search for Christian perfection
D14 0900  1    as the fountain-head of the American hope. Here, too,
D14 0900 11    must be placed Unitarianism and, less obviously from
D14 0910  8    Christian inspiration, Emerson, Transcendentalism,
D14 0920  3    and the idealism of Walt Whitman. We must also remember
D14 0930  4    those who reacted against the dream as a kind of myth-
D14 0940  1    among them Melville, Hawthorne, and Henry James the
D14 0940  9    elder, all of them out of a Christian background.
D14 0950  9    #REFORM MOVEMENTS#
D14 0950 11    With such a dream arising, at least in part, from the
D14 0960 11    Protestant heritage of the United States and built
D14 0970  7    into the foundations of the nation, it is not surprising
D14 0980  5    that many efforts were made to give it concrete expression.
D14 0990  2    A number were in the nature of movements to relieve
D14 0990 12    or remove social ills.
D14 1000  4       Significantly, the initiation and leadership of
D14 1010  2    a major proportion of the reform movements, especially
D14 1010 10    those in the first half of the nineteenth century,
D14 1020  8    came from men and women of New England birth or parentage
D14 1030  6    and from either Trinitarian or Unitarian Congregationalism.
D14 1040  2    Several of the movements were given a marked impetus
D14 1050  2    by revivalism. Quakers, some from New England, had
D14 1050 10    a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength
D14 1060  7    would have warranted. We do well to remind ourselves
D14 1070  7    that from men and women of New England ancestry also
D14 1080  3    issued the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,
D14 1090  3    the Seventh Day Adventists, Christian Science, the
D14 1100  1    American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions,
D14 1100  8    the American Home Missionary Society, the American
D14 1110  6    Bible Society, and New England theology. The atmosphere
D14 1120  5    was one of optimism, of confidence in human progress,
D14 1130  4    and of a determination to rid the world of its ills.
D14 1140  1    The Hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence,
D14 1140  6    although holding to original sin and the doctrine of
D14 1150  8    election, inspired its adherents to heroic endeavours
D14 1160  4    for others, looked for the early coming of the Millennium,
D14 1170  2    and was paralleled by the confidence in man's ability
D14 1180  1    cherished by the Unitarians, Emerson, and the Transcendentalists.
D14 1180  9       We should recall the number of movements for the
D14 1190 10    service of mankind which arose from the kindred Evangelicalism
D14 1200  7    of the British Isles and the Pietism of the Continent
D14 1210  7    of Europe- among them prison reform, anti-slavery measures,
D14 1220  5    legislation for the alleviation of conditions of labour,
D14 1230  3    the Inner Mission, and the Red Cross.
D14 1230 10       We cannot take the space to record all the efforts
D14 1240 10    for the removal or alleviation of collective ills.
D14 1250  4    A few of the more prominent must serve as examples
D14 1260  3    of what a complete listing and description would disclose.
D14 1270  1    Several were born in the early decades and persisted
D14 1270 10    throughout the century. Others were ephemeral. Some
D14 1280  6    disappeared with the attainment of their purpose. Still
D14 1290  5    others sprang up late in the century to meet conditions
D14 1300  2    which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary
D14 1300 10    age.
D14 1310  1    #THE ANTI-SLAVERY MOVEMENT#
D14 1310  4    The movement to end Negro slavery began before 1815
D14 1320  3    and mounted after that year until, as a result of the
D14 1320 14    Civil War, emancipation was achieved.
D14 1330  5       Long before 1815 the Christian conscience was leading
D14 1340  4    some to declare slavery wrong and to act accordingly.
D14 1350  2    For example, in 1693 the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting
D14 1360  1    of Friends declared that its members should emancipate
D14 1360  9    their slaves and in 1776 it determined to exclude from
D14 1370  9    membership all who did not comply. In the latter year
D14 1380  6    Samuel Hopkins, from whom the Hopkinsian strain of
D14 1390  3    New England theology took its name, asked the Continental
D14 1400  1    Congress to abolish slavery. As we have seen, Methodism
D14 1400 10    early took a stand against slavery. Beginning at least
D14 1410  8    as far back as 1789 various Baptist bodies condemned
D14 1420  4    slavery.
D14 1420  5       After 1815 anti-slavery sentiment mounted, chiefly
D14 1430  4    among Protestants and those of Protestant background
D14 1440  2    of the older stock. The nineteenth-century immigration,
D14 1450  1    whether Protestant or Roman Catholic, was not so much
D14 1450 10    concerned, for very few if any among them held slaves:
D14 1460 10    they were mostly in the Northern states where slavery
D14 1470  5    had disappeared or was on the way out, or were too
D14 1480  4    poverty-stricken to own slaves.
D14 1480  9       The anti-slavery movement took many forms. Benjamin
D14 1490  5    Lundy (1789-1839), a Quaker, was a pioneer in preparing
D14 1500  5    the way for anti-slavery societies. It was he who turned
D14 1510  4    the attention of William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879)
D14 1520  1    to the subject. Garrison, Massachusetts born of Nova
D14 1520  9    Scotian parentage, was by temperament and conviction
D14 1530  6    a reformer. Chiefly remembered because of his incessant
D14 1540  5    advocacy of "immediate and unconditional abolition",
D14 1550  2    he also espoused a great variety of other causes- among
D14 1560  1    them women's rights, prohibition, and justice to the
D14 1560  9    Indians. Incurably optimistic, dogmatic, and utterly
D14 1570  5    fearless, in his youth a devout Baptist, in spite of
D14 1580  5    his friendship for the Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier
D14 1590  3    (1807-1892) he eventually attacked the orthodox churches
D14 1600  2    for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the
D14 1600 11    slavery issue and in his invariably ardent manner was
D14 1610  9    emphatically unorthodox and denied the plenary inspiration
D14 1620  6    of the Bible.
D14 1620  9       A marked impulse came to the anti-slavery movement
D14 1630  8    through the Finney revivals. Finney himself, while
D14 1640  4    opposed to slavery, placed his chief emphasis on evangelism,
D14 1650  3    but from his converts issued much of the leadership
D14 1650 12    of the anti-slavery campaign. Theodore Dwight Weld
D14 1660  8    (1803-1895) was especially active. Weld was the son
D14 1670  7    and grandson of New England Congregational ministers.
D14 1680  2    As a youth he became one of Finney's band of evangelists
D14 1690  3    and gave himself to winning young men. A strong temperance
D14 1700  1    advocate, through the influence of a favorite teacher,
D14 1700  9    Charles Stewart, another Finney convert, he devoted
D14 1710  7    himself to the anti-slavery cause. A group of young
D14 1720  6    men influenced by him enrolled in Lane Theological
D14 1730  1    Seminary and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery
D14 1740  1    position. The majority then went to the infant Oberlin.
D14 1740 10    They and others employed some of Finney's techniques
D14 1750  7    as they sought to win adherents to the cause. Weld
D14 1760  6    contributed to the anti-slavery convictions of such
D14 1770  3    men as Joshua R& Giddings and Edwin M& Stanton, enlisted
D14 1780  2    John Quincy Adams, and helped provide ideas which underlay
D14 1790  1    Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. He shunned
D14 1800  1    publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame.
D14 1800  9       Wendell Phillips (1811-1884), from a prominent Massachusetts
D14 1810  7    family, in his teens was converted under the preaching
D14 1820  6    of Lyman Beecher. Although he later broke with the
D14 1830  5    churches because he believed that they were insufficiently
D14 1840  1    outspoken against social evils, he remained a devout
D14 1840  9    Christian. He was remembered chiefly for his fearless
D14 1850  8    advocacy of abolition, but he also stood for equal
D14 1860  7    rights for women, for opportunity for the freedmen,
D14 1870  2    and for prohibition.
D14 1870  5       The anti-slavery movement and other contemporary
D14 1880  3    reforms and philanthropies were given leadership and
D14 1890  2    financial undergirding by Arthur Tappan (1786-1865)
D14 1890  9    and his younger brother, Lewis Tappan (1788-1873).
D15 0010  1       Individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal
D15 0010  8    power were transmuted at death into awesome spirits;
D15 0020  8    they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer,
D15 0030  5    even more terrible abilities. Their direct descendants
D15 0040  3    inherited not only their worldly fortunes, but also
D15 0050  1    the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the
D15 0050 11    other half of the universe. Royal lineages could be
D15 0060  7    based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated
D15 0070  3    into eternal otherworldly power.
D15 0070  7       Thus, the emperor could draw on sources not available
D15 0080  9    to those with less puissant ancestors. But this eminence
D15 0090  6    was not without its weighty responsibilities. Since
D15 0100  2    he possessed more power in an interdependent universe
D15 0110  1    of living beings and dead spirits, the emperor had
D15 0110 10    to use it for the benefit of the living. The royal
D15 0120  8    ritual generated power into the other world: it also
D15 0130  5    provided the living with a way to control the spirits,
D15 0140  2    and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday
D15 0140 12    affairs of the world. Proper ritual observance at any
D15 0150  9    level of society was capable of generating power for
D15 0160  6    use in the spirit world; but naturally, the royal ritual,
D15 0170  4    which provided unusual control over already supremely
D15 0180  1    powerful divine spirits, was held responsible for regulating
D15 0180  9    the universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom.
D15 0190  9       This is the familiar system of "cosmic government".
D15 0200  6    The Chinese emperor, by proper observance of ritual,
D15 0210  5    manifested divine powers. He regulated the dualities
D15 0220  3    of light and darkness, Yang and Yin, which are locked
D15 0230  2    in eternal struggle. By swaying the balance between
D15 0230 10    them, he effected the alternation of the seasons. His
D15 0240  8    power was so great that he even promoted and demoted
D15 0250  6    gods according to whether they had given ear or been
D15 0260  4    deaf to petitions.
D15 0260  7       In this system, no man is exempt from obligations.
D15 0270  3    Failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one's
D15 0280  1    family, outrages to community propriety, any departure
D15 0280  8    from rigid standards of moral excellence were offenses
D15 0290  7    against the dead. And to offend the dead meant to incur
D15 0300  7    their wrath, and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide
D15 0310  3    disasters. The family home was, in fact, a temple;
D15 0320  1    and the daily duties of individuals were basically
D15 0320  9    religious in nature. The dead spirits occupied a prominent
D15 0330  8    place in every hope and in every fear.
D15 0340  4       The common belief was that there existed one moral
D15 0350  2    order, which included everything. The dead controlled
D15 0350  9    the material prosperity of the living, and the living
D15 0360  8    adhered to strict codes of conduct in order not to
D15 0370  6    weaken that control. Men believed they could control
D15 0380  2    nature by obeying a moral code. If the moral code were
D15 0380 13    flouted, the proper balance of the universe would be
D15 0390  9    upset, and the disastrous result could be floods, plague,
D15 0400  6    or famine.
D15 0400  8       Modern Westerners have difficulty comprehending
D15 0410  4    this fusion of moral and material, largely because
D15 0420  3    in the West the historical trend has been to deny the
D15 0430  1    connection. Living in urban conditions, away from the
D15 0430  9    deadweight of village constraint and the constrictions
D15 0440  6    of a thatched-roof world view, the individual may find
D15 0450  5    it possible, say, to commit adultery not only without
D15 0460  2    personal misgivings, but also without suffering any
D15 0460  9    adverse effects in his worldly fortunes. Basing action
D15 0470  8    on the empirical determination of cause and effect
D15 0480  5    provides a toughness and bravado that no powerful otherworldly
D15 0490  3    ancestor could ever impart- plus the added liberation
D15 0500  1    from the constraint of silent burial urns.
D15 0500  8       In China, the magical system par excellence was
D15 0510  7    Taoism. The Taoists were Quietist mystics, who saw
D15 0520  4    an unchanging unity- the Tao- underlying all phenomena.
D15 0530  3    It was this timeless unity that was all-important,
D15 0530 12    and not its temporary manifestations in the world of
D15 0540  9    reality. The Taoists believed the unity could be influenced
D15 0550  7    by proper magical manipulation; in other words, they
D15 0560  5    were actually an organization of magicians.
D15 0570  1       Mahayana Buddhism was no exception to these prevailing
D15 0570  9    magical concepts. After this form of Indian Buddhism
D15 0580  8    had been introduced into China, it underwent extensive
D15 0590  6    changes. During its flowering in the sixth to the eighth
D15 0600  6    centuries, Mahayana offered a supernatural package
D15 0610  1    to the Chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly
D15 0610 11    digested philosophical Zen morsels offered to the modern
D15 0620  8    Western reader. Mahayana had gods, and magic, a pantheon,
D15 0630  7    heavens and hells, and gorgeously appareled priests,
D15 0640  3    monks, and nuns, all of whom wielded power over souls
D15 0650  2    in the other world. The self-realized Mahayana saint
D15 0650 11    possessed superhuman powers and magic. The Mahayana
D15 0660  7    that developed in the north was a religion of idolatry
D15 0670  7    and coarse magic, that made the world into a huge magical
D15 0680  5    garden. In its monastic form, Mahayana was merely an
D15 0690  2    organization of magic-practicing monks (bonzes), who
D15 0690  9    catered to the Chinese faith in the supernatural.
D15 0700  8       Nonmagical Confucianism was a secular, rational
D15 0710  5    philosophy, but even with this different orientation
D15 0720  2    it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government.
D15 0730  1    Confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue
D15 0730 11    had power. If a man lived a classical life, he need
D15 0740 10    not fear the spirits- for only lack of virtue gave
D15 0750  6    the spirits power over him. But let us not be mistaken
D15 0760  2    about Confucian "virtue"; this was not virtue as we
D15 0770  1    understand the word today, and it did not mean an abandonment
D15 0770 12    of the belief in magic manipulation. To the Confucian,
D15 0780  7    "virtue" simply meant mastery and correct observance
D15 0790  5    of three hundred major rules of ritual and three thousand
D15 0800  4    minor ones. Propriety was synonymous with ritual observance,
D15 0810  2    the mark of a true gentleman. To live correctly in
D15 0810 12    an interdependent moral and material universe of living
D15 0820  8    and dead was decisive for man's fate.
D15 0830  4       This, in brief, was the historical background out
D15 0840  2    of which Zen emerged. Promoters of Zen to the West
D15 0840 12    record its ancestry, and recognize that Zen grew out
D15 0850  9    of a combination of Taoism and Indian Mahayana Buddhism.
D15 0860  6    But the "marvelous person" that is supposed to result
D15 0870  6    from Zen exhibits more Chinese practicality than Indian
D15 0880  3    speculation- he possesses magical powers, and can use
D15 0890  2    them to order nature and to redeem souls. Proponents
D15 0890 11    of Zen to the West emphasize disproportionately the
D15 0900  6    amount of Mahayana Buddhism in Zen, probably in order
D15 0910  6    to dignify the indisputably magical Taoist ideas with
D15 0920  3    more respectable Buddhist metaphysic. But in the Chinese
D15 0930  1    mind, there was little difference between the two-
D15 0930  9    the bonzes were no more metaphysical than a magician
D15 0940  8    has to be.
D15 0940 11       Actually, Zen owes more to Chinese Quietism than
D15 0950  8    it does to Mahayana Buddhism. The Ch'an (Zen) sect
D15 0960  5    may have derived its metaphysic from Mahayana, but
D15 0970  3    its psychology was pure early Taoist. This is well
D15 0975  1    evidenced by the Quietist doctrines carried over in
D15 0980  8    Zen: the idea of the inward turning of thought, the
D15 0990  7    enjoinder to put aside desires and perturbations so
D15 1000  3    that a return to purity, peace, and stillness- a union
D15 1010  2    with the Infinite, with the Tao- could be effected.
D15 1010 11    In fact, the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed
D15 1020  7    by modern exponents as so uniquely characteristic of
D15 1030  4    the "direct thinking" Zennist was a feature of Taoism.
D15 1040  3    So, too, was the insistence on the relativity of the
D15 1050  1    external world, and the ideas that language and things
D15 1050 10    perceived by consciousness were poor substitutes indeed
D15 1060  6    for immediate perception by pure, indwelling spirit:
D15 1070  4    the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating
D15 1080  1    consciousness.
D15 1080  2       Zen maintains that cognitive things are only the
D15 1090  4    surface of experience. One of its features attractive
D15 1100  1    to the West is its irreverence for tradition and dogma
D15 1100 11    and for sacred texts. One patriarch is supposed to
D15 1110  7    have relegated sacred scriptures for use in an outhouse.
D15 1120  6    But this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom
D15 1130  1    of action for which the Westerner mistakes it. It is
D15 1130 11    simply that in Taoist tradition- as in all good mysticisms-
D15 1140  9    books, words, or any other manifestations that belong
D15 1150  7    to the normal state of consciousness are considered
D15 1160  3    only the surface of experience. The truth- the Eternal
D15 1170  2    Truth- is not transmittable by words. Reality is considered
D15 1180  1    not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge,
D15 1180 10    but a positive handicap. The technique of reality confusion-
D15 1190  9    the use of paradox and riddles to shake the mind's
D15 1200  8    grip on reality- originated with fourth and third century
D15 1210  6    B&C& Chinese Quietism: the koan is not basically a
D15 1230  6    new device.
D15 1230  8       It is important for an understanding of Zen to realize
D15 1240  6    that the esoteric preoccupations of the select few
D15 1250  4    cannot be the doctrine of the common man. In the supernatural
D15 1260  1    atmosphere of cosmic government, only the ruling elite
D15 1260  9    was ever concerned with a kingdom-wide ordering of
D15 1270  8    nature: popular religion aimed at more personal benefits
D15 1280  6    from magical powers. And this is only natural- witness
D15 1290  2    the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest
D15 1300  1    "wonder drug". Early Chinese anchoritism was theoretically
D15 1300  8    aimed at a mystic pantheist union with the divine,
D15 1310  9    personal salvation being achieved when the mystical
D15 1320  5    recluse united with divine essence. But this esoteric
D15 1330  3    doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special
D15 1330 12    powers. The anchorite strove, in fact, to magically
D15 1340  8    influence the world of spirits in the same way that
D15 1350  8    the divine emperor manifested his power. Thus, the
D15 1360  3    Mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation
D15 1360 10    was distilled down to a bare self-seeking, and for
D15 1370 10    this reason, the mystic in Asia did not long remain
D15 1380  7    in isolated contemplation. As the Zen literature reveals,
D15 1390  3    as soon as an early Zen master attained fame in seclusion,
D15 1400  2    he was called out into the world to exercise his powers.
D15 1410  1    The early anchorite masters attracted disciples because
D15 1410  8    of their presumed ability to perform miracles.
D15 1420  5       Exponents of Zen often insist that very early Zen
D15 1430  5    doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism of China,
D15 1440  3    and proposed instead a more mature, less credulous
D15 1440 11    view of the universe. In support of this, stories from
D15 1450  9    the early literature are cited to show that Zen attacks
D15 1460  7    the idea of supernatural power. But actually these
D15 1470  3    accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters
D15 1480  1    were in fact supposed to possess, as well as the extreme
D15 1480 12    degree of popular credulity: "Hwang Pah (O baku), one
D15 1490  8    day going up Mount Tien Tai **h which was believed
D15 1500  7    to have been inhabited by Arhats with supernatural
D15 1510  3    powers, met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange
D15 1510 12    light. They went along the pass talking with each other
D15 1520 10    for a short while until they came to a river roaring
D15 1530  8    with torrent. There being no bridge, the master had
D15 1540  4    to stop at the shore; but his companion crossed the
D15 1550  2    river walking on the water and beckoned to Hwang Pah
D15 1550 12    to follow him. Thereupon Hwang Pah said: "If I knew
D15 1560  9    thou art an Arhat, I would have doubled you up before
D15 1570  8    thou got over there"! The monk then understood the
D15 1580  4    spiritual attainment of Hwang Pah, and praised him
D15 1590  2    as a true Mahayanist. (1)"
D15 1590  7       A second tale shows still more clearly the kind
D15 1610  5    of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess: "On
D15 1620  2    one occasion Yang Shan (Kyo-zan) saw a stranger monk
D15 1620 12    flying through the air. When that monk came down and
D15 1630 10    approached him with a respectful salutation, he asked:
D15 1640  5    "Where art thou from"? "Early this morning", replied
D15 1650  4    the other, "I set out from India". "Why", said the
D15 1660  4    teacher, "art thou so late"? "I stopped", responded
D15 1670  2    the man, "several times to look at beautiful sceneries".
D15 1680  1    "Thou mayst have supernatural powers", exclaimed Yang
D15 1680  8    Shan, "yet thou must give back the Spirit of Buddha
D15 1690 10    to me". Then the monk praised Yang Shan saying: "I
D15 1700  8    have come over to China in order to worship Manjucri,
D15 1710  6    and met unexpectedly with Minor Shakya", and after
D15 1720  3    giving the master some palm leaves he brought from
D15 1720 12    India, went back through the air. (2)"
D15 1730  7       In the popular Chinese mind, Ch'an (Zen) was no
D15 1740  6    exception to the ideas of coarse magic that dominated.
D15 1750  2       A closer look at modern Zen reveals many magical
D15 1760  1    carryovers that are still part of popular Zen attitudes.
D15 1760 10    To the Zen monk the universe is still populated with
D15 1770  9    "spiritual beings" who have to be appeased. Part of
D15 1780  8    the mealtime ritual in the Zendo consists in offerings
D15 1790  3    of rice to the spiritual beings". Modern Zen presentation
D15 1800  1    to the West insists on the anti-authoritarian, highly
D15 1800 10    pragmatic nature of the Zen belief- scriptures are
D15 1810  8    burned to make fire, action is based on direct self-confidence,
D15 1820  8    and so on. This picture of extreme self-reliant individuation
D15 1830  6    is difficult to reconcile with such Zendo formulas
D15 1840  3    as: "O you, demons and other spiritual beings, I now
D15 1850  3    offer this to you, and may this food fill up the ten
D15 1850 15    quarters of the world and all the demons and other
D15 1860 10    spiritual beings be fed therewith. (3)"
D16 0010  1       Pope Leo /13,, on the 13th day of December 1898,
D16 0010 11    granted the following indulgences: "An indulgence of
D16 0020  7    three hundred days is granted to all the Faithful who
D16 0030  7    read the Holy Gospels at least a quarter of an hour.
D16 0040  5    A Plenary Indulgence under the usual conditions is
D16 0050  2    granted once a month for the daily reading". Pope Pius
D16 0050 12    the Sixth, at Rome, in april, 1778, wrote the following:
D16 0060  9    "The faithful should be excited to the reading of the
D16 0070  9    Holy Scriptures: For these are the most abundant sources
D16 0080  6    which ought to be left open to everyone, to draw from
D16 0090  4    them purity of morals and of doctrine, to eradicate
D16 0100  1    errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt
D16 0100 10    times". The American Bishops assembled at the Third
D16 0110  7    Plenary Council of Baltimore urged the Catholic people
D16 0120  5    to read the Holy Bible. "We hope", they said, "that
D16 0130  4    no family can be found amongst us without a correct
D16 0140  2    version of the Holy Scriptures". They recommended,
D16 0140  9    also, that "at a fixed hour, let the entire family
D16 0150 10    be assembled for night prayers, followed by a short
D16 0160  6    reading of the Holy Scriptures".
D16 0170  1       Since the Catholic Church expresses such desire
D16 0170  8    that the Sacred Scriptures be read, the following taken
D16 0180  7    from the Holy Bible (New Catholic Edition) will prove
D16 0190  5    a means of grace and a source of great spiritual blessing.
D16 0200  3    #THE NEED OF THE NEW BIRTH#
D16 0200  9    Do not wonder that I said to thee, "You must be born
D16 0210  9    again". St& John 3:7.
D16 0220  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE GOD IS HOLY._
D16 0220 10       But as the One who called you is holy, be you also
D16 0230  9    holy in all your behavior; for it is written, You shall
D16 0240  6    be holy, because I am holy. /1, St& Peter 1:15, 16.
D16 0250  3       Holiness without which no man will see God. Hebrews
D16 0260  2    12:14.
D16 0270  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE ALL HAVE SINNED._
D16 0270  1       As it is written, There is not one just man; there
D16 0270 12    is none who understands; there is none who seeks after
D16 0280  9    God. All have gone astray together; **h All have sinned
D16 0290  7    and have need of the glory of God. Romans 3:10-12,
D16 0300  5    23.
D16 0310  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE NATURAL MAN
D16 0310  3    IS SPIRITUALLY DEAD AND BLIND._
D16 0310  8       Therefore as through one man sin entered into the
D16 0320  7    world and through sin death, and thus death has passed
D16 0330  3    unto all men because all have sinned. Romans 5:12.
D16 0330 12       You also, when you were dead by reason of your offenses
D16 0340 12    and sins. Ephesians 2:1.
D16 0350  3       And if our gospel also is veiled, it is veiled only
D16 0360  2    to those who are perishing. In their case, the god
D16 0360 12    of this world [Satan] has blinded their unbelieving
D16 0370  7    minds, that they should not see the light of the gospel
D16 0380  8    of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. /2,
D16 0390  4    Corinthians 4:3, 4.
D16 0390  7       For his workmanship we are, created in Christ Jesus.
D16 0400  7    Ephesians 2:10.
D16 0410  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS EFFECTED THROUGH THE WORD OF GOD_
D16 0410  8       For you have been reborn, not from corruptible seed
D16 0420  5    but from incorruptible, through the word of God. /1,
D16 0430  3    St& Peter 1:23.
D16 0430  6       Of his own will he has begotten us by the word of
D16 0440  6    truth. St& James 1:18.
D16 0440 10       Amen, amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born
D16 0450 10    again of water [symbol of the Word of God, see Ephesians
D16 0460  6    5:26] and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom
D16 0470  4    of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and
D16 0480  2    that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. St& John
D16 0480 13    3:5, 6.
D16 0490  2    #EVIDENCES OF THE NEW BIRTH#
D16 0500  1    _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE HAVE FAITH IN CHRIST AS THE
D16 0500  6    ONLY SAVIOUR._
D16 0500  8       Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is
D16 0510  6    born of God. /1, St& John 5:1.
D16 0520  1       As many as received him **h were born **h of God.
D16 0520 12    St& John 1:12, 13.
D16 0530  2    _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE DO NOT PRACTICE SIN AS A
D16 0540  1    HABIT._
D16 0540  1       Whoever is born of God does not commit sin [That
D16 0540 11    is, he does not practice sin. Cf& /1, St& John 2:1].
D16 0550  8    /1, St& John 3:9.
D16 0560  1       We know that no one who is born of God commits sin.
D16 0560 13    /1, St& John 5:18. [The new nature, received at the
D16 0570 10    time of regeneration, is divine and holy, and as the
D16 0580  8    believer lives under the power of this new nature he
D16 0590  6    does not practice sin.]
D16 0600  1    _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE PRACTICE RIGHTEOUSNESS._
D16 0600  5       If you know that he [God] is just [righteous], know
D16 0610  3    that everyone also who does what is just [righteous]
D16 0620  1    has been born of him. /1, St& John 2:29.
D16 0630  1    _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE LOVE GOD._
D16 0630  7       Everyone who loves is born of God, and knows God.
D16 0640  3    /1, St& John 4:7.
D16 0650  1    _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE LOVE THE BRETHREN._
D16 0650  3       We know that we have passed from death to life,
D16 0650 13    because we love the brethren. He who does not love
D16 0660 10    abides in death. /1, St& John 3:14.
D16 0680  1    _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE OVERCOME THE WORLD._
D16 0680  1       All that is born of God overcomes the world; and
D16 0680 11    this is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith.
D16 0690  7    /1, St& John 5:4.
D16 0700  1    _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE GROW IN [NOT INTO, BUT IN]
D16 0700 14    GRACE._
D16 0700 15       But grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and
D16 0710 10    Savior, Jesus Christ. /2, St& Peter 3:18.
D16 0730  1    _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE PERSEVERE UNTO THE END._
D16 0730  3       I am convinced of this, that he who has begun a
D16 0730 14    good work in you will bring it to perfection until
D16 0740  9    the day of Christ Jesus. Philippians 1:6.
D16 0750  3       Now to him who is able to preserve you without sin
D16 0760  2    and to set you before the presence of his glory, without

D16 0800  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE SPIRITUAL KINGDOM
D16 0810  1    REQUIRES A SPIRITUAL NATURE._
D16 0810  1       Jesus answered and said to him [Nicodemus] "Amen,
D16 0810  9    amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he
D16 0820 10    cannot see the kingdom of God". **h "Amen, amen, I

D16 0840 14    That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that

D16 0870  9    #THE NATURE OF THE NEW BIRTH#
D16 0880  3    _THE NEW BIRTH IS A NEW CREATION._
D16 0880 10       For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision
D16 0890  5    but a new creation is of any account. Galatians 6:15.
D16 0900  5       If then any man is in Christ, he is a new creature
D16 0910  6    [literally, "He is a new creation"], the former things
D16 0920  3    have passed away; behold, they are made new! /2, Corinthians
D16 0930  1    5:17.
D16 0930  2       For by grace you have been saved through faith;
D16 0940  1    and that not from yourselves, for it is the gift of
D16 0940 12    God; not as the outcome of works, lest anyone may boast.
D16 0950 10    For his workmanship we are, created in Christ Jesus.
D16 0960  7    Ephesians 2:8-10.
D16 0970  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS THE IMPLANTATION OF A NEW LIFE._
D16 0970  8       I came that they may have life. St& John 10:10.
D16 0980  4       He who has the Son has the life. He who has not
D16 0990  4    the Son has not the life. /1, St& John 5:12.
D16 1000  1       He who believes in the Son [Jesus Christ, the Son
D16 1000 11    of God], has everlasting life. St& John 3:36.
D16 1020  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS THE IMPARTATION OF THE DIVINE NATURE._
D16 1020  6       Through which he has granted us the very great and
D16 1030  5    precious promises, so that through them you may become
D16 1040  1    partaker of the divine nature. /2, St& Peter 1:4.
D16 1050  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS CHRIST LIVING IN YOU BY FAITH._
D16 1050  9       Christ in you, your hope of glory. Colossians 1:27.
D16 1060  5       It is now no longer I that live, but Christ lives
D16 1070  4    in me. And the life that I now live in the flesh, I
D16 1080  2    live in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and
D16 1080 15    gave himself up for me. Galatians 2:20.
D16 1090  6       To have Christ dwelling through faith in your hearts.
D16 1100  5    Ephesians 3:17.
D16 1110  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS MIRACULOUS AND MYSTERIOUS._
D16 1110  3       The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its
D16 1120  2    sound but dost not know where it comes from or where
D16 1120 13    it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.
D16 1130 10    St& John 3:8.
D16 1140  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS IMMEDIATE AND INSTANTANEOUS._
D16 1140  7       Amen, amen, I say to you, he who hears my word,
D16 1150  7    and believes him who sent me, has life everlasting,
D16 1160  1    and does not come to judgment, but has passed from
D16 1160 11    death to life. St& John 5:24.
D16 1170  5    #THE MEANS OF THE NEW BIRTH#
D16 1180  1    _THE NEW BIRTH IS A WORK OF GOD._
D16 1180  7       But to as many as received him he gave the power
D16 1190  2    of becoming sons of God; to those who believe in his
D16 1190 13    name: Who were born not of blood, nor of the will of
D16 1200 12    the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. St&
D16 1210  8    John 1:12, 13.
D16 1210 11    #A FINAL WORD#
D16 1220  1    You may be very religious, a good church member, an
D16 1220 11    upright, honest and sincere person; you may be baptized,
D16 1230  8    confirmed, reverent and worshipful; you may attend
D16 1240  4    mass, do penance, say prayers and zealously keep all
D16 1250  3    the sacraments and ceremonies of the church; you may
D16 1250 12    have the final and extreme unction but if you are not
D16 1260 11    born again you are lost and headed for hell and eternal
D16 1270  7    punishment. You cannot be saved; you cannot go to heaven
D16 1280  6    unless you are born again. Our blessed Lord Jesus Christ,
D16 1290  3    the sinless Son of God, who could not lie, said, "Amen,
D16 1300  1    amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he
D16 1300 13    cannot see the kingdom of God" (St& John 3:3). "You
D16 1310  9    must be born again" (St& John 3:7).
D16 1320  4       Being convinced that salvation is alone by accepting
D16 1330  4    Christ as Saviour, and being convicted by the Holy
D16 1340  1    Spirit of my lost condition, I do repent of all effort
D16 1340 12    to be saved by any form of good works, and just now
D16 1350 10    receive Jesus as my personal Saviour and salvation
D16 1360  4    as a free gift from Him.
D16 1365  1       YOU MAY DO AS YOU PLEASE with God now. It is permitted.
D16 1370  8    God placed Himself in men's hands when He sent Jesus
D16 1380  6    Christ into the world as perfect God and perfect Man
D16 1390  4    in one Being. He was then in man's hands. They cursed
D16 1400  2    Him. It was permitted. Men spit on Him. God allowed
D16 1400 12    it. They called Him a devil. God withheld His wrath.
D16 1410 10    Finally men arrested Him, gave Him a mock trial, flogged
D16 1420  8    Him, nailed Him on a cross and hung Him between earth
D16 1430  6    and heaven; and God allowed it.
D16 1440  1       You can do likewise though Christ is not bodily
D16 1440 10    present. You can ignore Him. You can ignore His Book,
D16 1450  8    the Bible, and His church. You can laugh at His blood-bought
D16 1460  7    salvation, curse His followers, and laugh at hell.
D16 1470  4    It is permitted. The eternal Christ may knock at your
D16 1480  1    soul's door, calling you to give up sin and prepare
D16 1480 11    for heaven. You may refuse Him, spit on Him, call Him
D16 1490 10    a devil, curse Him. It is permitted. You may take His
D16 1500  7    name upon your lips in oaths and curses if you so choose.
D16 1510  5    He is in your hands- now.
D16 1510 11       On the other hand, you may seek His favor, humble
D16 1520  9    yourself before Him and beg His mercy, implore His
D16 1530  5    forgiveness, forsake your sins, and abandon your whole
D16 1540  3    life to Him. He has said, "Behold, I stand at the door,
D16 1550  1    and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door,
D16 1550 13    I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he
D16 1560 12    with me" (Revelation 3:20). The choice is up to you.
D16 1570  8    The latch is on your side of the door. The choice is
D16 1580  5    yours: the revellings and banquetings of this world
D16 1590  2    or quiet communion with God; the ever burning lusts
D16 1590 11    of the flesh or the powerful victory of Holy Spirit
D16 1600  8    discipline. The choice is yours: God is in your hands,
D16 1610  7    now.
D16 1610  8       God has already set the day when you will be in
D16 1620  8    His hands. What He does with you then depends on what
D16 1630  4    you do with Him now. Then it will be a "fearful thing
D16 1640  4    to fall into the hands of the living God" if you have
D16 1650  2    abused Him in your hands.
D17 0010  1    I am a magazine; my name is Guideposts; this issue
D17 0010 11    that you are reading marks my 15th anniversary.
D17 0020  6       When I came into being, 15 years ago, I had one
D17 0030  6    primary purpose: to help men and women everywhere to
D17 0040  2    know God better, and through knowing Him better to
D17 0040 11    become happier and more effective people. That purpose
D17 0050  7    has never changed.
D17 0060  1       When you read me, you are holding in your hands
D17 0060 11    the product of many minds and hearts. Some of the people
D17 0070  8    who speak through my pages are famous; others unknown.
D17 0080  4    Some work with their hands. Some have walked through
D17 0090  2    pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope.
D17 0090 12    Some are so filled with gratitude, for the gift of
D17 0100 10    life and the love of God, that their joy spills out
D17 0110  6    on the paper and brightens the lives of thousands whom
D17 0120  2    they have never known, and will never see.
D17 0120 10       Fifteen years ago, there were no Guideposts at all.
D17 0130  9    This month a million Guideposts will circulate all
D17 0140  5    over the world. Experts in the publishing field consider
D17 0150  3    this astounding. They do not understand how a small
D17 0160  1    magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale
D17 0160  9    could have achieved such a following.
D17 0170  4       To me, the explanation is very simple. I am not
D17 0180  3    doing anything, of myself. I am merely a channel for
D17 0180 13    **h something.
D17 0190  1       What is this something? I cannot define it fully.
D17 0200  1    It is the force in the universe that makes men love
D17 0200 12    goodness, even when they turn away from it. It is the
D17 0210 10    power that holds the stars in their orbits, but allows
D17 0220  5    the wind to bend a blade of grass. It is the whisper
D17 0230  2    in the heart that urges each one to be better than
D17 0230 13    he is. It is mankind's wistful yearning for a world
D17 0240  8    of justice and peace.
D17 0250  1       All things are possible to God, but He chooses-
D17 0250 10    usually- to work through people. Sometimes such people
D17 0260  7    sense that they are being used; sometimes not.
D17 0270  4       Fifteen years ago, troubled by the rising tide of
D17 0280  3    materialism in the post-war world, a businessman and
D17 0280 12    a minister asked themselves if there might not be a
D17 0290  9    place for a small magazine in which men and women,
D17 0300  6    regardless of creed or color, could set forth boldly
D17 0310  3    their religious convictions and bear witness to the
D17 0310 11    power of faith to solve the endless problems of living.
D17 0320 10       The businessman was Raymond Thornburg. The minister
D17 0330  6    was Norman Vincent Peale. Neither had any publishing
D17 0340  5    experience, but they had faith in their idea. They
D17 0350  3    borrowed a typewriter, raised about $2,000 in contributions,
D17 0360  1    hired a secretary, persuaded a couple of young men
D17 0360 10    to join them for almost no pay **h and began mailing
D17 0370  8    out a collection of unstapled leaflets that they called
D17 0380  4    Guideposts.
D17 0380  5       Compared to the big, established magazines, my first
D17 0390  4    efforts seemed feeble indeed. But from the start they
D17 0400  3    had two important ingredients: sincerity and realism.
D17 0400 10    The people who told the stories were sincere. And the
D17 0410 10    stories they told were true.
D17 0420  3       For example, early in my life, when one of my editorial
D17 0430  1    workers wanted to find out how churches and philanthropic
D17 0430 10    organizations met the needs of New York's down-and-outers,
D17 0440 10    he didn't just ask questions. Len LeSourd went and
D17 0450  8    lived in the slums as a sidewalk derelict for ten days.
D17 0460  5       That was nearly 13 years ago. Len LeSourd is my
D17 0470  4    executive editor today.
D17 0470  7       Many of you are familiar, I'm sure, with the story
D17 0480  6    of my early struggles: the fire in January, 1947, that
D17 0490  5    destroyed everything- even our precious list of subscribers.
D17 0500  3    The help and sympathy that were forthcoming from everywhere.
D17 0510  1    The crisis later on when debts seemed about to overwhelm
D17 0510 11    me.
D17 0520  1       That was when a remarkable woman, Teresa Durlach,
D17 0520  9    came to my aid- not so much with money, as with wisdom
D17 0530  9    and courage. "You're not living up to your own principles",
D17 0540  8    she told my discouraged people. "You're so preoccupied
D17 0550  4    that you've let your faith grow dim. What do you want-
D17 0560  5    a hundred thousand subscribers? Visualize them, then,
D17 0570  3    believe you are getting them, and you will have them"!
D17 0580  1       And the 100,000 subscribers became a reality. And
D17 0580  9    then 500,000. And now a million January Guideposts
D17 0590  7    are in circulation.
D17 0600  1       With our growth came expansion into new fields of
D17 0600 10    service. Today more than a thousand industries distribute
D17 0610  7    me to their employees. They say all personnel have
D17 0620  5    spiritual needs which Guideposts helps to meet. Hundreds
D17 0630  3    of civic clubs, business firms and individuals make
D17 0630 11    me available to school teachers throughout the land.
D17 0640  8    They say it helps them bring back into schools the
D17 0650  7    spiritual and moral values on which this country was
D17 0660  3    built.
D17 0660  4       Thousands of free copies are sent each month to
D17 0670  3    chaplains in the Armed Forces, to prison libraries
D17 0670 11    and to hospitals everywhere. Bedridden people say I
D17 0680  6    am easy to hold- and read. Three years ago it became
D17 0690  6    possible to finance a Braille edition for blind readers.
D17 0700  4       Throughout these exciting years I have been fortunate
D17 0710  2    for, although I have never offered great financial
D17 0710 10    inducements, talent has found its way to me: William
D17 0720  9    Boal who so ably organizes business operations; John
D17 0730  4    Beach who guides circulation; Irving Granville and
D17 0740  4    Nelson Rector who travel widely calling on business
D17 0750  1    firms.
D17 0750  2       Searching for the best in spiritual stories, my
D17 0760  1    roving editors cover not only the country, but the
D17 0760 10    whole world. Glenn Kittler has been twice to Africa,
D17 0770  7    once spending a week with Dr& Albert Schweitzer. Last
D17 0780  4    summer John and Elizabeth Sherrill were in Alaska.
D17 0790  3    Van Varner recently returned from Russia.
D17 0790  9       Twice a month the editorial staff meets in New York
D17 0800 10    for an early supper, then a long evening of idea-exchange.
D17 0810  8    Around the table sit Protestant, Catholic, and Jew.
D17 0820  4    Each contributes something different, and something
D17 0830  1    important: Ruth Peale, her wide experience in church
D17 0830  9    work; Sidney Fields, years of experience as a New York
D17 0840 10    columnist; Catherine Marshall LeSourd the insight that
D17 0850  6    has made her books world-famous and Norm Mullendore,
D17 0860  4    the keen perception of an advertising executive.
D17 0870  2       There are people who travel long distances to assure
D17 0880  1    my continued existence. Elaine St& Johns may fly in
D17 0880 10    from the West Coast for the editorial staff meetings.
D17 0890  7    Starr Jones gets up every morning at five o'clock,
D17 0900  5    milks his family cow, attends to farm chores, and then
D17 0910  3    takes a two-hour train trip to New York. Arthur Gordon
D17 0920  1    comes once a month all the way from Georgia.
D17 0920 10       We have also seen the power of faith at work among
D17 0930  9    us. Rose Weiss, who handles all the prayer-requests
D17 0940  4    that we receive, answering each letter personally,
D17 0950  1    has the serene selflessness that comes from suffering:
D17 0950  9    she has had many major operations, and now gets about
D17 0960  8    in a limited way on braces and crutches. Recently,
D17 0970  4    John Sherrill was stricken with one of the deadliest
D17 0980  2    forms of cancer. We prayed for John, during surgery,
D17 0980 11    we asked others to pray; all over the country a massive
D17 0990 11    shield of prayer was thrown around him. Today the cancer
D17 1000  8    is gone.
D17 1000 10       Perhaps it is not fair to mention some people without
D17 1010  9    mentioning all. But, you see, those who are not mentioned
D17 1020  7    will not resent it. That is the kind of people they
D17 1030  4    are.
D17 1030  5       Perhaps you think the editorial meetings are solemn
D17 1040  3    affairs, a little sanctimonious? Not so. Serious, yes,
D17 1050  1    but also much laughter. Sharp division of opinion,
D17 1050  9    too, and strenuous debate. There are brain-wracking
D17 1060  6    searches for the right word, the best phrase, the most
D17 1070  4    helpful idea. And there is also something intangible
D17 1080  1    that hovers around the table. A good word for it is
D17 1080 12    fellowship. A shorter word is love.
D17 1090  6       Each meeting starts with a prayer, offered spontaneously
D17 1100  2    by one member of the group. It takes many forms, this
D17 1110  2    prayer, but in essence it is always a request for guidance,
D17 1110 13    for open minds and gentle hearts, for honesty and sincerity,
D17 1120  9    for the wisdom and the insights that will help Guideposts'
D17 1130  8    readers.
D17 1130  9       For you, readers, are an all-important part of the
D17 1140  9    spiritual experiment that is Guideposts. I need your
D17 1150  6    support, your criticism, your encouragement, your prayers.
D17 1160  3       I am a magazine; my name is Guideposts. My message,
D17 1170  3    today, is the same as it was 15 years ago: that there
D17 1180  1    is goodness in people, and strength and love in God.
D17 1180 11       May He bless you all.
D17 1200  1       HAVANA was filled with an excitement which you could
D17 1200 10    see in the brightness of men's eyes and hear in the
D17 1210 11    pitch of their voices. The hated dictator Batista had
D17 1220  6    fled. Rumors flew from lip to lip that Fidel Castro
D17 1230  4    was on his way to Havana, coming from the mountains
D17 1240  1    where he had fought Batista for five years. Already
D17 1240 10    the city was filled with Barbudos, the bearded, war-dirty
D17 1250  8    Revolutionaries, carrying carbines, waving to the crowds
D17 1260  6    that lined the Prado.
D17 1260 10       And then Castro himself did come, bearded, smiling;
D17 1270  8    yet if you looked closely you'd see that his eyes did
D17 1280  7    not pick up the smile on his lips.
D17 1290  1       At first I was happy to throw the support of our
D17 1290 12    newspaper behind this man. I am sure that Castro was
D17 1300 10    happy, too, about that support. Diario de la Marina
D17 1310  5    was the oldest and most influential paper in Cuba,
D17 1320  3    with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny.
D17 1320 11    My grandfather had been stoned because of his editorials.
D17 1330  9    My own earliest memories are of exiles: my three brothers
D17 1340  8    and I were taken often to the United States "to visit
D17 1350  7    relatives" while my father stayed on to fight the dictator
D17 1360  6    Machado.
D17 1360  7       When it was my turn, I, too, printed the truth as
D17 1370  5    I knew it about Batista, and rejoiced to see his regime
D17 1380  3    topple. None of us was aware that the biggest fight
D17 1380 13    was still ahead.
D17 1390  3       I was full of hope as Fidel Castro came into Havana.
D17 1400  1    Within a week, however, I began to suspect that something
D17 1400 11    was wrong. For Castro was bringing Cuba not freedom,
D17 1410  9    but hatred. He spent long hours before the ~TV spitting
D17 1420  7    out promises of revenge. He showed us how he dealt
D17 1430  6    with his enemies: he executed them before ~TV cameras.
D17 1440  3    On home sets children were watching the death throes
D17 1450  1    of men who were shot before the paredon, the firing
D17 1450 11    wall.
D17 1450 12       Castro's reforms? He seemed bent on coupling them
D17 1460  8    with vengeance. New schools were rising, but with this
D17 1470  7    went a harsh proclamation: any academic degree earned
D17 1480  4    during Batista's regime was invalid.
D17 1490  1       Economic aid? He had promised cheaper housing: arbitrarily
D17 1490  8    he cut all rents in half, whether the landlord was
D17 1500  9    a millionaire speculator or a widow whose only income
D17 1510  7    was the rental of a spare room. Under another law,
D17 1520  3    hundreds of farms were seized. Farm workers had their
D17 1520 12    wages cut almost in half. Of this, only 50 cents a
D17 1530 11    day was paid in cash, the rest in script usable only
D17 1540  7    in "People's Stores".
D17 1550  1       A suspicion was growing that Fidel Castro was a
D17 1560  9    Communist. In my mind, I began to review: his use of
D17 1570  8    hate to gain support; his People's Courts; his division
D17 1580  4    of society into two classes, one the hero, the other
D17 1590  3    the villain. But most disturbing of all were the advisers
D17 1600  1    he called to sit with him in the Palace; many came
D17 1600 12    from Communist countries.
D17 1610  2       What should I do about it, I asked myself? I had
D17 1620  3    watched Castro handling his enemies before the paredon.
D17 1620 11    There was no doubt in my mind that if I crossed him,
D17 1630 12    mobs would appear outside our windows shouting "Paredon!
D17 1640  5    Paredon! **h"
D17 1640  7       What should I do? I was proud of the new buildings
D17 1650 11    which housed Diario now: the rotogravures, gleaming
D17 1660  5    behind glass doors; the thump and whir of our new presses.
D17 1670  7    Here was a powerful, ready-made medium, but it could
D17 1680  4    speak only if I told it to.
D17 1680 11       Then one day, early in January, 1960, I sat down
D17 1690  7    at my desk, and suddenly I was aware of the crucifix.
D17 1700  4    It was a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had
D17 1710  1    given me. I had mounted it on velvet and hung it over
D17 1710 13    my desk to remind me always to use the power of the
D17 1720  9    paper in a Christian manner. Now it seemed almost as
D17 1730  6    if Jesus were looking down at me with sadness in His
D17 1740  3    eyes, saying:
D17 1740  5       "You will lose the paper. You may lose your life.
D17 1750  4    But do you have any choice"?
D17 1750 10       I knew in that moment that I did not have any choice.
D17 1760  9    From that day on I began to write editorials about
D17 1770  5    the things I did not think correct in Fidel Castro's
D17 1780  3    regime.
