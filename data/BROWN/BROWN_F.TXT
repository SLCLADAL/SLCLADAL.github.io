F01 0010  1       In American romance, almost nothing rates higher
F01 0010  8    than what the movie men have called "meeting cute"-
F01 0020  7    that is, boy-meets-girl seems more adorable if it doesn't
F01 0030  7    take place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom.
F01 0040  4    Just about the most enthralling real-life example of
F01 0050  2    meeting cute is the Charles MacArthur-Helen Hayes saga:
F01 0060  1    reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts,
F01 0060 12    but he said simultaneously, "I wish they were emeralds".
F01 0070  7    Aside from the comico-romantico content here, a good
F01 0080  5    linguist-anthropologist could readily pick up a few
F01 0090  5    other facts, especially if he had a little more of
F01 0090 15    the conversation to go on.
F01 0100  5       The way MacArthur said his line- if you had the
F01 0110  4    recorded transcript of a professional linguist- would
F01 0120  1    probably have gone like this: **f Primary stresses
F01 0120  9    on emeralds and wish; note pitch 3 (pretty high) on
F01 0130  8    emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl, one degree
F01 0140  5    of oversoftness **h. Conclusions: The people involved
F01 0150  2    (and subsequent facts bear me out here) knew clearly
F01 0150 11    the relative values of peanuts and emeralds, both monetary
F01 0160  8    and sentimental. And the drawling, oversoft voice of
F01 0170  7    flirtation, though fairly overt, was still well within
F01 0180  5    the prescribed gambit of their culture.
F01 0190  1       In other words, like automation machines designed
F01 0190  7    to work in tandem, they shared the same programming,
F01 0200  5    a mutual understanding not only of English words, but
F01 0210  3    of the four stresses, pitches, and junctures that can
F01 0220  1    change their meaning from black to white. At this point,
F01 0220 11    unfortunately, romance becomes a regrettably small
F01 0230  6    part of the picture; but consider, if you can bear
F01 0240  5    it, what might have happened if MacArthur, for some
F01 0250  2    perverse, undaunted reason, had made the same remark
F01 0250 10    to an Eskimo girl in Eskimo. To her peanuts and emeralds
F01 0260  9    would have been just so much blubber. The point- quite
F01 0270  7    simply- is this: words they might have had; but communication,
F01 0280  6    no.
F01 0280  7       This basic principle, the first in a richly knotted
F01 0290  7    bundle, was conveyed to me by Dr& Henry Lee Smith,
F01 0300  3    Jr&, at the University of Buffalo, where he heads the
F01 0310  2    world's first department of anthropology and linguistics.
F01 0310  9    A brisk, amusing man, apparently constructed on an
F01 0320  8    ingenious system of spring-joints attuned to the same
F01 0330  7    peppery rhythm as his mind, Smith began his academic
F01 0340  4    career teaching speech to Barnard girls- a project
F01 0350  1    considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording
F01 0350  9    about "a young rat named Arthur, who never could make
F01 0360  8    up his mind". Later, he became one of the central spirits
F01 0370  7    of the Army Language Program and the language school
F01 0380  4    of Washington's Foreign Service Institute. It was there,
F01 0390  4    in the course of trying to prepare new men for the
F01 0390 15    "culture shock" they might encounter in remote overseas
F01 0400  8    posts, that he first began to develop a system of charting
F01 0410  9    the "norms of human communication".
F01 0420  1       To the trained ear of the linguist, talk has always
F01 0430  1    revealed a staggering quantity of information about
F01 0430  8    the talker- such things as geographical origin and/or
F01 0440  7    history, socio-economic identity, education. It is
F01 0450  4    only fairly recently, however, that linguists have
F01 0460  2    developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper
F01 0460 11    in a way that tells even more about the speakers and
F01 0470  9    about the success or failure of human communication
F01 0480  4    between two people. This, for obvious reasons, makes
F01 0490  2    their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric
F01 0500  1    interview, so useful, in fact, that they have been
F01 0500 10    successfully used to suggest ways to speed diagnosis
F01 0510  7    and to evaluate the progress of therapy.
F01 0520  1       In the early 1950's, Smith, together with his distinguished
F01 0530  1    colleague, George Trager (so austerely academic he
F01 0530  8    sometimes fights his own evident charm), and a third
F01 0540  9    man with the engaging name of Birdwhistell (Ray), agreed
F01 0550  5    on some basic premises about the three-part process
F01 0560  2    that makes communication: (1) words or language (2)
F01 0560 10    paralanguage, a set of phenomena including laughing,
F01 0570  7    weeping, voice breaks, and "tone" of voice, and (3)
F01 0580  7    kinesics, the technical name for gestures, facial expressions,
F01 0590  4    and body shifts- nodding or shaking the head, "talking"
F01 0600  3    with one's hands, et cetera.
F01 0600  8       Smith's first workout with stresses, pitches, and
F01 0610  7    junctures was based on mother, which spells, in our
F01 0620  5    culture, a good deal more than bread alone. For example,
F01 0630  3    if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person, there
F01 0630 12    are certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate
F01 0640  8    for addressing your mother. The usual U&S& norm would
F01 0650  6    be: **f Middle pitches, slight pause (juncture) before
F01 0660  4    mother, slight rise at the end. The symbols of mother's
F01 0670  3    status, here, are all usual for culture U&S&A&. Quite
F01 0680  2    other feelings are evidenced by this style: **f Note
F01 0680 11    the drop to pitch 1 (the lowest) on mother with no
F01 0690 11    rise at the end of the sentence; this is a "fade" ending,
F01 0700  7    and what you have here is a downtalking style of speech,
F01 0710  5    expressing something less than conventional respect
F01 0720  2    for mother. Even less regard for mom and mom's apple
F01 0720 12    pie goes with: **f In other words, the way the speaker
F01 0730 11    relates to mother is clearly indicated. And while the
F01 0740  7    meaning of the words is not in this instance altered,
F01 0750  4    the quality of communication in both the second and
F01 0760  2    third examples is definitely impaired. An accompanying
F01 0760  9    record of paralanguage factors for the second example
F01 0770  8    might also note a throaty rasp. With this seven-word
F01 0790  6    sentence- though the speaker undoubtedly thought he
F01 0800  3    was dealing only with the subject of food- he was telling
F01 0810  1    things about himself and, in the last two examples,
F01 0810 10    revealing that he had departed from the customs of
F01 0820  8    his culture.
F01 0820 10       The joint investigations of linguistics and psychiatry
F01 0830  5    have established, in point of fact, that no matter
F01 0840  6    what the subject of conversation is or what words are
F01 0850  2    involved, it is impossible for people to talk at all
F01 0850 12    without telling over and over again what sort of people
F01 0860  9    they are and how they relate to the rest of the world.
F01 0870  7    Since interviewing is the basic therapeutic and diagnostic
F01 0880  3    instrument of modern psychiatry, the recording of interviews
F01 0890  2    for playbacks and study has been a boost of Redstone
F01 0890 12    proportions in new research and training. Some of the
F01 0900  9    earliest recordings, made in the 1940's, demonstrated
F01 0910  6    that psychiatrists reacted immediately to anger and
F01 0920  4    anxiety in the sound track, whereas written records
F01 0930  1    of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy
F01 0930 11    which- if they were at all discernible in print- were
F01 0940  9    picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts.
F01 0950  5    In a general way, psychiatrists were able to establish
F01 0960  4    on a wide basis what many of them had always felt-
F01 0970  3    that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic,
F01 0970 12    that such things as stress and nagging are transmitted
F01 0980  8    by sound alone and not necessarily by words.
F01 0990  4       At a minimum, recording- usually on tape, which
F01 1000  2    is now in wide professional use- brings the psychiatric
F01 1000 11    interview alive so that the full range of emotion and
F01 1010 10    meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist
F01 1020  5    or by a battery of therapists. Newest to this high-powered
F01 1030  5    battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried
F01 1040  2    that minimum to a new level. By adding a systematic
F01 1040 12    analysis with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews,
F01 1050  9    they have supplied a new set of techniques for the
F01 1060  8    therapist. Linguistic charting of the transcribed interview
F01 1070  4    flags points where the patient's voice departs from
F01 1080  2    expected norms. It flags such possible breakdowns of
F01 1080 10    communication as rehearsed dialogue, the note of disapproval,
F01 1090  8    ambivalence or ambiguity, annoyance, resentment, and
F01 1100  6    the disinclination to speak at all- this last often
F01 1110  4    marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences.
F01 1120  1       Interpretation, naturally, remains the role of the
F01 1120  8    therapist, but orientation- not only the patient's
F01 1130  5    vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic
F01 1140  4    background, but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways
F01 1150  1    of danger spots in his relationship to people- can
F01 1150 10    be considerably beefed up by the linguist. His esoteric
F01 1160  8    chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas
F01 1170  5    where deeper probing may bring to light underlying
F01 1180  1    psychological difficulties, making them apparent first
F01 1180  7    to the therapist and eventually to the patient. In
F01 1190  8    one now-historic first interview, for example, the
F01 1210  4    transcript (reproduced from the book, The First Five
F01 1220  3    Minutes) goes like this: **f The therapist's level
F01 1230  1    tone is bland and neutral- he has, for example, avoided
F01 1230 11    stressing "you", which would imply disapproval; or
F01 1240  7    surprise, which would set the patient apart from other
F01 1250  7    people. The patient, on the other hand, is far from
F01 1260  5    neutral; aside from her specifically regional accent,
F01 1270  1    she reveals by the use of the triad, "irritable, tense,
F01 1270 11    depressed", a certain pedantic itemization that indicates
F01 1280  7    she has some familiarity with literary or scientific
F01 1290  5    language (i&e&, she must have had at least a high-school
F01 1300  7    education), and she is telling a story she has mentally
F01 1310  3    rehearsed some time before. Then she catapults into
F01 1310 11    "everything and everybody", putting particular violence
F01 1320  6    on "everybody", indicating to the linguist that this
F01 1330  7    is a spot to flag- that is, it is not congruent to
F01 1340  7    the patient's general style of speech up to this point.
F01 1350  4    Consequently, it is referred to the therapist for attention.
F01 1360  1    He may then very well conclude that "everybody" is
F01 1360 10    probably not the true target of her resentment. Immediately
F01 1370  9    thereafter, the patient fractures her rehearsed story,
F01 1380  6    veering into an oversoft, breathy, sloppily articulated,
F01 1390  3    "I don't feel like talking right now".
F01 1400  1       Within the first five minutes of this interview
F01 1400  9    it is apparent to the therapist that "everybody" truthfully
F01 1410  7    refers to the woman's husband. She says later, but
F01 1420  6    still within the opening five minutes, "I keep thinking
F01 1430  4    of a divorce but that's another emotional death".
F01 1440  1       The linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery
F01 1440  8    are all present in the voice chart for this sentence;
F01 1450 10    so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce.
F01 1460  8    By saying "another emotional death", she reveals that
F01 1470  5    there has been a previous one, although she has not
F01 1480  4    described it in words. This the therapist may pursue
F01 1481  1    in later questioning. The phrase, "emotional death",
F01 1490  7    interesting and, to a non-scientific mind, rather touching,
F01 1500  8    suggests that this woman may have some flair for words,
F01 1510  7    perhaps even something of the temperament regrettably
F01 1520  2    called "creative".
F01 1520  4       Since the psychiatric interview, like any other
F01 1530  4    interview, depends on communication, it is significant
F01 1540  1    to note that the therapist in this interview was a
F01 1540 11    man of marked skill and long experience. His own communication
F01 1550  8    apparatus operated superbly, and Lillian Ross readers
F01 1560  6    will note instantly its total lack of resemblance to
F01 1570  5    the blunted, monumentally unmeshed mechanism of Dr&
F01 1580  2    Blauberman. Interestingly enough- although none of
F01 1580  8    the real-life therapists involved could conceivably
F01 1590  5    compare with Blauberman- when groups of them began
F01 1600  8    playing back interviews, they discovered any number
F01 1610  3    of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview
F01 1620  1    techniques; almost everyone, on first hearing one of
F01 1620  9    his own sessions on tape, expressed some desire to
F01 1630  7    take the whole thing over again.
F01 1640  1       Yet, in spite of this, intensive study of the taped
F01 1640 11    interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists
F01 1650  7    laid bare the surprising fact that, in the first five
F01 1660  6    minutes of an initial interview, the patient often
F01 1670  2    reveals as many as a dozen times just what's wrong
F01 1670 12    with him; to spot these giveaways the therapist must
F01 1680  8    know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen.
F01 1690  6    Naturally, the patient does not say, "I hate my father",
F01 1700  5    or "Sibling rivalry is what bugs me". What he does
F01 1701  4    do is give himself away by communicating information
F01 1710  8    over and above the words involved. Some of the classic
F01 1720 10    indicators, as described by Drs& Pittenger, Hockett,
F01 1730  5    and Danehy in The First Five Minutes, are these:
F01 1740  5    _AMBIGUITY OF PRONOUNS:_
F01 1740  8       Stammering or repetition of I, you, he, she, et
F01 1750  9    cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty. On the
F01 1770  5    other hand significant facts may be concealed- she
F01 1780  4    may mean I; or everybody, as it did with the tense
F01 1790  1    and irritable woman mentioned before, may refer to
F01 1790  9    a specific person. The word that is not used can be
F01 1800  9    as important as the word that is used; therapist and/or
F01 1810  5    linguist must always consider the alternatives. When
F01 1820  2    someone says, for example, "They took ~X rays to see
F01 1830  2    that there was nothing wrong with me", it pays to consider
F01 1830 13    how this statement would normally be made. (This patient,
F01 1840  9    in actuality, was a neurasthenic who had almost come
F01 1850  8    to the point of accepting the fact that it was not
F01 1870  5    her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty.)
F01 1880  1    **h Amateur linguists note here that Pursewarden, in
F01 1880  9    Durrell's Alexandria Quartet, stammered when he spoke
F01 1890  7    of his wife, which is hardly surprising in view of
F01 1900  7    their disastrous relationship.
F02 0010  1       @ She was just another freighter from the States,
F02 0010 10    and she seemed as commonplace as her name. She was
F02 0020  8    the John Harvey, one of those Atlantic sea-horses that
F02 0030  7    had sailed to Bari to bring beans, bombs, and bullets
F02 0040  4    to the U&S& Fifteenth Air Force, to Field Marshal Montgomery's
F02 0050  3    Eighth Army then racing up the calf of the boot of
F02 0060  3    Italy in that early December of 1943.
F02 0060 10       The John Harvey arrived in Bari, a port on the Adriatic,
F02 0070  9    on November 28th, making for Porto Nuovo, which, as
F02 0080  7    the name indicates, was the ancient city's new and
F02 0090  4    modern harbor. Hardly anyone ashore marked her as she
F02 0100  2    anchored stern-to off Berth 29 on the mole. If anyone
F02 0100 13    thought of the John Harvey, it was to observe that
F02 0110 10    she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden
F02 0120  7    with high explosive and if they were hit the John Harvey
F02 0130  4    would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever
F02 0140  2    else it was that she carried.
F02 0140  8       Which was poison gas.
F02 0150  1    ##
F02 0150  2    It had required the approval of President Franklin
F02 0150 10    Delano Roosevelt before the John Harvey could be loaded
F02 0160  8    with 100 tons of mustard gas and despatched to the
F02 0170  7    Italian warfront. For in a world as yet unacquainted
F02 0180  4    with the horrors of the mushroom cloud, poison gas
F02 0190  1    was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons.
F02 0190 10       Throughout the early years of World War /2,, reports
F02 0200  9    persisted that the Axis powers had used gas- Germany
F02 0210  7    in Russia, Japan in China again. They were always denied.
F02 0220  5    Influential people in America were warning the Pentagon
F02 0230  3    to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by the
F02 0240  2    Germans in future campaigns. Some extremists went so
F02 0240 10    far as to urge our using it first. To silence extremists,
F02 0250  9    to warn the Axis, President Roosevelt issued this statement
F02 0260  5    for the Allies in August:
F02 0270  1       "From time to time since the present war began there
F02 0270 11    have been reports that one or more of the Axis powers
F02 0280 11    were seriously contemplating use of poisonous gas or
F02 0290  6    noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare.
F02 0300  3    I have been loath to believe that any nation, even
F02 0300 13    our present enemies, could or would be willing to loose
F02 0310 10    upon mankind such terrible and inhumane weapons.
F02 0320  5       "However, evidence that the Axis powers are making
F02 0330  5    significant preparations indicative of such an intention
F02 0340  2    is being reported with increasing frequency from a
F02 0340 10    variety of sources.
F02 0350  3       "Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general
F02 0360  2    opinion of civilized mankind. This country has not
F02 0360 10    used them, and I hope that we never will be compelled
F02 0370 10    to use them. I state categorically that we shall under
F02 0380  5    no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons
F02 0390  2    unless they are first used by our enemies".
F02 0390 10       The following month the invasion of Italy was begun,
F02 0400  9    and Roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consenting
F02 0410  7    to the stockpiling of poison gas in southern Italy.
F02 0420  3    Bari was chosen as a depot, not only for its seeming
F02 0430  1    safety, but because of its proximity to airfields.
F02 0430  9    Any retaliatory gas attack would be airborne. It would
F02 0440  8    be made in three waves- the first to lay down a smokescreen,
F02 0450  7    the second to drop the gas bombs, the third to shower
F02 0460  4    incendiaries which would burn everything below.
F02 0470  1       So the vile cargo went into the hole of the John
F02 0470 12    Harvey. A detachment of six men from the 701st Chemical
F02 0480  8    Maintenance Company under First Lt& Howard D& Beckstrom
F02 0490  6    went aboard, followed by Lt& Thomas H& Richardson,
F02 0500  4    the Cargo Security Officer. Secrecy was paramount.
F02 0510  3    Only a few other people- very important people- knew
F02 0520  1    of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks. No
F02 0520 10    one else must know. Thus, in the immemorial way- in
F02 0530  8    the way of the right hand that knows and the left that
F02 0540  6    does not- was the stage set for tragedy at Bari.
F02 0550  3       It was the night of December 2, 1943, and it was
F02 0550 14    growing dark in Bari. It was getting on toward 7 o'clock
F02 0560 11    and the German ~Me-210 plane had been and gone on its
F02 0580  8    eighth straight visit. Capt& A& B& Jenks of the Office
F02 0590  7    of Harbor Defense was very worried. He knew that German
F02 0600  6    long-range bombers had been returning to the attack
F02 0610  4    in Italy. On November 24th, they had made a raid on
F02 0610 15    La Maddalena. Two days later, some 30 of them had struck
F02 0620 11    at a convoy off Bougie, sinking a troopship- and it
F02 0630  8    had been that very night that the ~Me-210 had made
F02 0640  6    its first appearance. After it had reappeared the next
F02 0650  3    two nights, Jenks went to higher headquarters and said:
F02 0660  1       "For three days now a German reconnaissance plane
F02 0660  9    has been over the city taking pictures. They're just
F02 0670  8    waiting for the proper time to come over here and dump
F02 0680  8    this place into the Adriatic".
F02 0690  1       But the older and wiser heads had dismissed his
F02 0690 10    warning as alarmist. Even though it was known that
F02 0700  7    the Luftwaffe in the north was now being directed by
F02 0710  4    the young and energetic General Peltz, the commander
F02 0720  1    who would conduct the "Little Blitz" on London in 1944,
F02 0720 11    a major raid on Bari at this juncture of the war was
F02 0730 12    not to be considered seriously. True, there had been
F02 0740  6    raids on Naples- but Naples was pretty far north on
F02 0750  5    the opposite coast. No, Bari was out of range. More
F02 0760  2    than that, Allied air had complete superiority in the
F02 0760 11    Eighth Army's sector. So Captain Jenks returned to
F02 0770  8    his harbor post to watch the scouting plane put in
F02 0780  6    five more appearances, and to feel the certainty of
F02 0790  3    this dread rising within him. For Jenks knew that Bari's
F02 0800  1    defenses were made of paper. The Royal Air Force had
F02 0800 11    but a single light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon
F02 0810  8    units available. There were no R&A&F& fighter squadrons
F02 0820  6    on Bari airfield. The radar station with the best location
F02 0830  7    was still not serviceable. Telephone communication
F02 0840  2    was bad. And everywhere in evidence among the few remaining
F02 0850  2    defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster-
F02 0850 10    multiple command.
F02 0860  2       It had been made shockingly evident that very morning
F02 0870  1    to Ensign Kay K& Vesole, in charge of the armed guard
F02 0870 12    aboard the John Bascom. A British officer had come
F02 0880  8    aboard and told him that in case of enemy air attack
F02 0890  8    he was not to open fire until bombs were actually dropped.
F02 0900  4    Then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a radar-controlled
F02 0910  1    shore gun firing white tracers.
F02 0910  6       "This harbor is a bomber's paradise", the Britisher
F02 0920  6    had said with frank grimness. "It's up to you to protect
F02 0930  7    yourselves. We can't expect any help from the fighters
F02 0940  5    at Foggia, either. They're all being used on offensive
F02 0950  2    missions".
F02 0950  3       Vesole had been stunned. Not fire until the bombs
F02 0960  3    came down! He thought of the tons and tons of flammable
F02 0970  1    fluid beneath his feet and shook his head. Like hell!
F02 0970 11    Like hell he'd wait- and supposing the radar-controlled
F02 0980  8    gun got knocked out? What would his guns guide on then-
F02 0990  8    the North Star? Ensign Vesole decided that he would
F02 1000  6    not tarry until he heard the whispering of the bombs,
F02 1010  4    and when night began to fall, he put Seaman 2/~c Donald
F02 1020  1    L& Norton and Seaman 1/~c William A& Rochford on the
F02 1020 11    guns and told them to start shooting the moment they
F02 1030 10    saw an enemy silhouette. Below decks, Seaman 1/~c Stanley
F02 1040  6    Bishop had begun to write a letter home.
F02 1050  4    ##
F02 1050  5    Above decks on the John Harvey, Lieutenant Richardson
F02 1060  2    gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall
F02 1060 12    and felt uneasy. There were lights glinting in the
F02 1070  9    city, too, even though it was now dark enough for a
F02 1080  8    few stars to become visible. Bari was asking for it,
F02 1090  4    he thought.
F02 1090  6       For five days now, they had been in port and that
F02 1100  5    filthy stuff was still in the hold. Richardson wondered
F02 1110  1    when it would be unloaded. He hoped they would put
F02 1110 11    it somewhere way, way down in the earth. The burden
F02 1120  8    of his secret was pressing down on him, as it was on
F02 1130  7    Lieutenant Beckstrom and his six enlisted men. Lieutenant
F02 1140  2    Richardson could envy the officers and men of the John
F02 1150  1    Harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained
F02 1150 10    nothing more dangerous than high explosive bombs. They
F02 1160  8    seemed happy at the delay in unloading, glad at the
F02 1170  7    chance to go ashore in a lively liberty port such as
F02 1180  4    Bari. Nine of them had gone down the gangplank already.
F02 1190  1    Deck Cadet James L& Cahill and Seaman Walter Brooks
F02 1190 10    had been the first to leave. Richardson had returned
F02 1200  9    their departing grins with the noncommittal nod that
F02 1210  6    is the security officer's stock in trade.
F02 1220  2       The other half of the crew, plus Beckstrom and his
F02 1220 12    men, had remained aboard. Richardson glanced to sea
F02 1230  8    and started slightly. Damned if that wasn't a sailing
F02 1240  7    ship standing out of the old harbor- Porto Vecchio.
F02 1250  5    The night was so clear that Richardson had no difficulty
F02 1260  2    making out the silhouette. Then the thought of a cloudless
F02 1270  1    sky made him shiver, and he glanced upward. His eyes
F02 1270 11    boggled.
F02 1280  1       It was a clear night and it was raining!
F02 1280 10       Capt& Michael A& Musmanno, Military governor of
F02 1290  6    the Sorrentine Peninsula, had also seen and felt the
F02 1300  6    "rain". But he had mistaken it for bugs.
F02 1310  1       Captain Musmanno's renovated schooner with the flamboyant
F02 1320  1    name Unsinkable had just left Porto Vecchio with a
F02 1320 10    cargo of badly-needed olive oil for the Sorrentine's
F02 1330  6    civilian population. Musmanno was on deck. At exactly
F02 1340  6    7:30, he felt a fluttering object brush his face. He
F02 1350  4    snatched at it savagely. He turned the beam of his
F02 1350 14    flashlight on it. He laughed. It was the silver foil
F02 1360 10    from the chocolate bar he had been eating. He frowned.
F02 1370  8    But how could-? Another, longer strip of tinsel whipped
F02 1390  6    his mouth. It was two feet long. It was not candy wrapping.
F02 1400  4       It was "window"- the tinsel paper dropped by bombers
F02 1410  4    to jam radar sets, to fill the scope with hundreds
F02 1420  1    of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers.
F02 1420 10       "Fermate"! Musmanno bellowed to his Italian crewmen.
F02 1430  7    "Stop! Stop the engines"!
F02 1440  3       Unsinkable slowed and stopped, hundreds of brilliant
F02 1450  3    white flares swayed eerily down from the black, the
F02 1450 12    air raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek, the
F02 1460 10    anti-aircraft guns coughed and chattered- and above
F02 1470  5    it all motors roared and the bombs came whispering
F02 1480  2    and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor
F02 1490  1    at Bari.
F02 1490  3       They had come from airports in the Balkans, these
F02 1500  1    hundred-odd Junkers 88's. They had winged over the
F02 1500 10    Adriatic, they had taken Bari by complete surprise
F02 1510  7    and now they were battering her, attacking with deadly
F02 1520  4    skill. They had ruined the radar warning system with
F02 1530  2    their window, they had made themselves invisible above
F02 1530 10    their flares. And they also had the lights of the city,
F02 1540 10    the port wall lanterns, and a shore crane's spotlight
F02 1550  6    to guide on. After the first two were blacked out,
F02 1560  4    the third light was abandoned by a terrified Italian
F02 1570  1    crew, who left their light to shine for nine minutes
F02 1570 11    like an unerring homing beacon until British ~MP's
F02 1580  6    shot it out.
F02 1580  9       In that interval, the German bombers made a hell
F02 1590  8    of Bari harbor.
F02 1590 11       Merchant ships illuminated in the light of the flares,
F02 1600  9    made to seem like stones imbedded in a lake of polished
F02 1610  8    mud, were impossible to miss. The little Unsinkable
F02 1620  4    sank almost immediately. Captain Musmanno roared at
F02 1630  3    his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together
F02 1630 15    for a raft. They got it over the side and clambered
F02 1640 11    aboard only a few minutes before their schooner went
F02 1650  6    under.
F02 1650  7       John Bascom went down early, too. Ensign Vesole
F02 1660  7    and his gunners had fought valiantly, but they had
F02 1670  4    no targets. Most of the Junkers were above the blinding
F02 1680  2    light of the flares, and the radar-controlled shore
F02 1680 11    gun had been knocked out by one of the first sticks
F02 1690 10    of bombs. Vesole rushed from gun to gun, attempting
F02 1700  6    to direct fire. He was wounded, but fought on. Norton
F02 1710  3    and Rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors.
F02 1720  1    Bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20~mm gun, pumping
F02 1720 11    out 400 rounds before sticks of three bombs each crashed
F02 1730  8    into Holds One, Three and Five. Now the Bascom was
F02 1740  6    mortally wounded. Luckily, she was not completely aflame
F02 1750  4    and would go down before the gasoline could erupt.
F02 1760  1       The order to abandon ship was given, but cries of
F02 1760 11    pain could be heard from the wounded below decks.
F03 0010  1       THERE IS a pause in the merriment as your friends
F03 0010 11    gaze at you, wondering why you are staring, open-mouthed
F03 0020  9    in amazement. You explain, "I have the strangest feeling
F03 0030  6    of having lived through this very same event before.
F03 0040  5    I can't tell when, but I'm positive I witnessed this
F03 0050  2    same scene of this particular gathering at some time
F03 0050 11    in the past"!
F03 0060  3       This experience will have happened to many of you.
F03 0070  2       Emerson, in his lecture, refers to the "**h startling
F03 0070 11    experience which almost every person confesses in daylight,
F03 0080  8    that particular passages of conversation and action
F03 0090  6    have occurred to him in the same order before, whether
F03 0100  4    dreaming or waking, a suspicion that they have been
F03 0110  2    with precisely these persons in precisely this room,
F03 0110 10    and heard precisely this dialogue, at some former hour,
F03 0120  8    they know not when".
F03 0130  1       Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that
F03 0130  8    weird feeling as the deja vue (already seen) illusion,
F03 0140  8    just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences.
F03 0150  5    In this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless
F03 0160  2    investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which
F03 0170  1    all of us grope continually.
F03 0170  6       When a man recognizes a certain experience as the
F03 0180  4    exact pattern of a previous dream, we have an instance
F03 0185  1    of deja vue, except for the fact that he knows just
F03 0190  9    why the experience seems familiar. Occasionally there
F03 0200  5    are examples of prevision which cannot be pushed aside
F03 0210  6    without confessing an unscientific attitude.
F03 0220  1       One day Maeterlinck, coming with a friend upon an
F03 0220 10    event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a
F03 0230 10    previous dream, detailed the ensuing occurrences in
F03 0240  5    advance so accurately that his companion was completely
F03 0250  3    mystified.
F03 0250  4       Rudyard Kipling's scorn for the "jargon" of psychical
F03 0260  3    research was altered somewhat when he wondered "**h
F03 0270  2    how, or why, had I been shown an unreleased roll of
F03 0270 13    my life film"? The famous author tells us of the strange
F03 0280 10    incident in Something About Myself.
F03 0290  3       One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony
F03 0300  2    in Westminster Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout
F03 0310  1    man on his left, his attention turned to the irregular
F03 0310 11    pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone, clasping
F03 0320  7    him by the arm, whispered, "I want a word with you,
F03 0330  7    please". At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with
F03 0340  3    awed amazement, suddenly recalling that these identical
F03 0350  1    details of scene, action and word had occurred to him
F03 0350 11    in a dream six weeks earlier.
F03 0360  3       Freud probably contributed more than anyone else
F03 0370  1    to the understanding of dreams, enabling us to recognize
F03 0370 10    their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts. However,
F03 0380  6    readers who accept Freud's findings and believe that
F03 0390  5    he has solved completely the mystery of dreams, should
F03 0400  3    ponder over the following words in his Interpretation
F03 0410  1    Of Dreams, Chapter /1,: "**h as a matter of fact no
F03 0410 12    such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished
F03 0420 10    in any case, and what is more, every one attempting
F03 0430  8    such solution has found that in most cases there have
F03 0440  6    remained a great many components of the dream the source
F03 0450  3    of which he has been unable to explain **h nor is the
F03 0450 15    discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic
F03 0460 10    power of dreams".
F03 0470  1       Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy, clairvoyance,
F03 0480  1    prevision and retrovision. The basic mystery of dreams,
F03 0480  9    which embraces all the others and challenges us from
F03 0490  8    even the most common typical dream, is in the fact
F03 0500  6    that they are original, visual continuities.
F03 0510  1       I recall the startling, vivid realism of a dream
F03 0510 10    in which I lived through the horror of the bombing
F03 0515  8    of a little Korean town. I am sure that nothing within
F03 0520  5    me is capable of composing that life-like sequence,
F03 0530  1    so complete in detail, from the hodge-podge of news
F03 0530 11    pictures I have seen. And when psychology explains
F03 0540  8    glibly, "but the subconscious mind is able to produce
F03 0550  6    it" it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified
F03 0560  2    that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably
F03 0570  1    as part of the individual mind.
F03 0570  7       Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of
F03 0580  5    dreams as things they have never personally observed,
F03 0590  2    but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright
F03 0590 12    avoidance of routine evidence.
F03 0600  4       The question becomes, "What is a dream"?
F03 0610  3       Is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie?
F03 0620  1       Every dream, and this is true of a mental image
F03 0620 11    of any type even though it may be readily interpreted
F03 0630  8    into its equivalent of wakeful thought, is a psychic
F03 0640  5    phenomenon for which no explanation is available. In
F03 0650  2    most cases we recognize certain words, persons, animals
F03 0650 10    or objects. But these are dreamed in original action,
F03 0660  8    in some particular continuity which we don't remember
F03 0670  5    having seen in real life. For instance, the dreamer
F03 0680  3    sees himself seated behind neighbor Smith and, with
F03 0690  1    photographic realism, sees Smith driving the car; whereas,
F03 0690  9    it is a matter of fact that Smith cannot drive a car.
F03 0700 11    There is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter
F03 0710  7    past impressions to fit into an original, realistic
F03 0720  2    and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams.
F03 0720 10       The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical
F03 0730 10    basis of a mental image can find no logical support.
F03 0740  9    A "mental image" subconsciously impressing us from
F03 0750  4    beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought, or
F03 0760  3    consciously in light sleep, is actually not an image
F03 0760 12    at all but is comprised of realities, viewed not in
F03 0770 10    the concurrent sensory stream, but within the depths
F03 0780  6    of the fourth dimension.
F03 0780 10       Dreams that display events of the future with photographic
F03 0790  9    detail call for a theory explaining their basic mystery
F03 0800  8    and all its components, including that weird feeling
F03 0810  4    of deja vue, inevitably fantastic though that theory
F03 0820  3    must seem.
F03 0820  5       As in the theory of perception, established in
F03 0830  2    psycho-physiology,
F03 0830  4    the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain.
F03 0840  4    But then this theory confesses that it is completely
F03 0840 13    at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received
F03 0850 12    by the brain. The opening paragraph of the chapter
F03 0860  6    titled The Theory Of Representative Perception, in
F03 0870  3    the book Philosophies Of Science by Albert G& Ramsperger
F03 0880  4    says, "**h passed on to the brain, and there, by some
F03 0890  3    unexplained process, it causes the mind to have a perception".
F03 0900  1       But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal
F03 0900 10    image within the brain? As retinal images are conceded
F03 0910  9    to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical
F03 0920  8    to suppose that the nerves, between the inner brain
F03 0930  4    and the eyes, carry the direct drive for cooperation
F03 0940  1    from the various brain centers- rather than to theorize
F03 0940 10    on the transmission of an image which is already in
F03 0950  8    required location. Hereby, the external object viewed
F03 0960  5    by the eyes remains the thing that is seen, not the
F03 0970  3    retinal image, the purpose of which would be to achieve
F03 0970 13    perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses
F03 0980  6    in the other sensory centers, motor tensions, associated
F03 0990  5    word symbols, and consciousness.
F03 1000  1       Modern physics has developed the theory that all
F03 1000  9    matter consists of minute waves of energy. We know
F03 1010  8    that the number of radio and television impulses, sound
F03 1020  4    waves, ultra-violet rays, etc&, that may occupy the
F03 1030  2    very same space, each solitary upon its own frequency,
F03 1030 11    is infinite. So we may conceive the coexistence of
F03 1040  8    the infinite number of universal, apparently momentary
F03 1050  3    states of matter, successive one after another in consciousness,
F03 1060  4    but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive
F03 1070  3    frequencies. This theory makes it possible for any
F03 1080  1    event throughout eternity to be continuously available
F03 1080  8    at any moment to consciousness.
F03 1090  2       Space in any form is completely measured by the
F03 1100  1    three dimensions. If the fourth dimension is a physical
F03 1100 10    concept and not purely metaphysical, through what medium
F03 1110  7    does it extend? It is not through space nor time that
F03 1120  7    the time machine most approved by science fiction must
F03 1130  3    travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past,
F03 1140  1    or the ever-existent past-fantasy future. Three seconds
F03 1140 10    flat is the usual time, and the space is crossed by
F03 1150  9    moderate mileage, while the overwhelming immensity
F03 1160  3    of such journeys must be conceived as a static pulsation
F03 1170  2    through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies
F03 1170  9    which perpetuate all events.
F03 1180  4       The body, senses and brain, in common with all matter,
F03 1190  3    have their counterpart on each of a countless number
F03 1190 12    of frequencies. The senses in each counterpart bear
F03 1200  8    the impression only of phenomena that share its own
F03 1210  7    frequency, whereas those upon all other frequencies
F03 1220  2    are invisible, inaudible and intactible to them. Consciousness
F03 1230  1    is the factor that provides the progressive continuity
F03 1230  9    to sensory impressions. When consciousness deserts
F03 1240  5    the sleeping body and the wakeful world, it continues
F03 1250  5    in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past
F03 1260  2    and future, in a life as vibrant and real as the one
F03 1260 14    left when the body tired and required sleep.
F03 1270  8       If the photographically realistic continuity of
F03 1280  4    dreams, however bizarre their combinations, denies
F03 1290  2    that it is purely a composition of the brain, it must
F03 1290 13    be compounded from views of diverse realities, although
F03 1300  7    some of them may never be encountered in what we are
F03 1310  7    pleased to call the real life.
F03 1320  1       Dr& H& V& Hilprecht, Professor of Assyrian at the
F03 1320  9    University of Pennsylvania, dreamed that a Babylonian
F03 1330  7    priest, associated with the king Kurigalzu, (1300 B&C&)
F03 1340  6    escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple
F03 1350  5    of Bel, gave him six novel points of information about
F03 1360  2    a certain broken relic, and corrected an error in its
F03 1360 12    identification. As a matter of fact, the incorrect
F03 1370  8    classification, the result of many weeks of labor by
F03 1380  7    Dr& Hilprecht, was about to be published by him the
F03 1390  4    following day. Some time later the missing part of
F03 1390 13    the relic was found and the complete inscription, together
F03 1400  8    with other new evidence, fully corroborated the ancient
F03 1410  5    priest's information. Dr& Hilprecht was uncertain as
F03 1420  5    to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream.
F03 1430  4    He was almost positive it was not Assyrian nor Cassite,
F03 1440  1    and imagined it must have been German or English.
F03 1440 10       We may conclude that all six points of information,
F03 1450  8    ostensibly given by the dream priest, could have been
F03 1460  6    furnished by Dr& Hilprecht's subconscious reasoning.
F03 1470  3    But, in denying any physical reality for this dream,
F03 1480  3    how could the brain possibly compose that realistic,
F03 1480 11    vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout,
F03 1490  7    violent break or sudden substitution? Which theory
F03 1500  5    is more fantastic: 1. that the perfect continuity was
F03 1510  4    composed from the joblot of memory impressions in the
F03 1520  3    professor's brain, or 2. that the dream was a reality
F03 1520 13    on the infinite progressions of universal, gradient
F03 1530  6    frequencies, across which the modern professor and
F03 1540  5    the priest of ancient Nippur met?
F03 1550  1       The degree of circumstance, the ratio of memory
F03 1550  9    to forgetfulness, determines whether a dream will be
F03 1560  6    a recognized, fulfilled prevision, or the vaguely,
F03 1570  3    effective source of the weird deja vue feeling. No
F03 1580  1    doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave
F03 1580 10    no trace on the sleeper's mind. Probably less than
F03 1590  6    one percent of our previsions escape final obliteration
F03 1600  4    before we wake. When we arrive at the events concerned
F03 1610  2    in the vanished majority, they, of course, cannot impress
F03 1620  1    us as anything familiar. Nevertheless, there are notably
F03 1620  9    frequent instances of deja vue, in which our recognition
F03 1630  9    of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived
F03 1640  8    through it before, a feeling which, though vague, withstands
F03 1650  4    the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of
F03 1660  3    psychologists. If deja vue is an illusion, then peculiarly,
F03 1670  1    it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting
F03 1670  9    even the most level-headed people.
F03 1680  4       Chauncey Depew, one-time runner-up for the Republican
F03 1690  3    Presidential nomination, was attending a convention
F03 1700  1    at Saratoga, where he was scheduled to nominate Colonel
F03 1700 10    Theodore Roosevelt for Governor of New York when he
F03 1710  8    noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had
F03 1720  7    never met. After the preliminary business affair was
F03 1730  3    finished Depew arose and delivered the convincing speech
F03 1740  1    that clinched the nomination for Roosevelt. If Depew
F03 1740  9    had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird
F03 1750  8    feeling of having lived through that identical convention
F03 1760  4    session at some time in the past, he would have been
F03 1770  3    informed that he was a victim of deja vue. But the
F03 1770 14    famous orator felt more than vague recognition for
F03 1780  8    the scene. He remembered exactly when he had lived
F03 1790  6    through it before, and he had something to prove he
F03 1800  4    had.
F03 1800  5       One week before the convention, Depew was seated
F03 1810  2    on the porch of a country home on the Hudson, gazing
F03 1810 13    at the opposite shore.
F04 0010  1       "THE FOOD IS WONDERFUL and it is a lot of fun to
F04 0010 13    be here"!
F04 0020  1       So wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his
F04 0020 13    parents from North Country School, Lake Placid, New
F04 0030  8    York. In this one sentence, he unwittingly revealed
F04 0040  6    the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological
F04 0050  3    programs in operation at the school.
F04 0060  1       Because the food is selected with thought for its
F04 0060  9    nutritional value, care for its origin, and prepared
F04 0070  6    in a manner that retains the most nutrients, the food
F04 0080  3    does taste good. When served in a psychological atmosphere
F04 0090  2    that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest
F04 0090 10    good from what they eat because they are free from
F04 0100  9    tension, a foundation is laid for a high level of health
F04 0110  7    that releases the children from physical handicaps
F04 0120  2    to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments,
F04 0120 10    the athletic programs and the most important phase,
F04 0130  8    the educational opportunities.
F04 0140  1       Situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain
F04 0150  1    scenery in the country, the school buildings are located
F04 0150 10    amid open fields and farm lands. These contemporary
F04 0160  6    structures, beautifully adapted to a school in the
F04 0170  5    country, are home to 60 children, ages eight to fourteen,
F04 0180  1    grades four through eight. From fourteen states and
F04 0180  9    three foreign countries they come to spend the months
F04 0190  8    from mid-September to June.
F04 0200  1       The Director, Walter E& Clark, believes that a school
F04 0210  1    with children living full time in its care must take
F04 0210 11    full responsibility for their welfare. To him this
F04 0220  7    means caring for the whole child, providing basic nutrition,
F04 0230  4    and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom for the
F04 0240  3    development of the mind.
F04 0240  7    #IMPROVED FARMING METHODS#
F04 0240 10    The concept of good nutrition really began with the
F04 0250  9    garden. The school has always maintained a farm to
F04 0260  6    supply the needs of the school. In a climate hostile
F04 0270  2    to agriculture, Mr& Clark has had to keep alert to
F04 0270 12    the most productive farm techniques.
F04 0280  5       Where a growing season may, with luck, allow 60
F04 0290  5    days without frost, and where the soil is poor, sandy,
F04 0300  2    quick-drying and subject to erosion, many farmers fail.
F04 0300 11    Throughout the Adirondack region abandoned farm homes
F04 0310  7    and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their
F04 0320  5    owners met defeat.
F04 0320  8       Mr& Clark found that orthodox procedures of deep
F04 0330  7    plowing, use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides,
F04 0340  3    plus the application of conservation principles of
F04 0350  2    rotation and contouring, did not prevent sheet erosion
F04 0350 10    in the potato fields and depreciation of the soil.
F04 0360  7       "To give up these notions required a revolution
F04 0370  5    in thought", Mr& Clark said in reminiscing about the
F04 0380  3    abrupt changes in ideas he experienced when he began
F04 0390  1    reading "Organic Gardening" and "Modern Nutrition"
F04 0390  7    in a search for help with his problems.
F04 0400  7       "Louis Bromfield's writings excited me as a conservationist".
F04 0410  6    By 1952 he was convinced he would no longer spray.
F04 0420  5    He locked his equipment in a cabinet where it still
F04 0430  2    remains. After reading "Plowman's Folly" by Edward
F04 0430  9    H& Faulkner, he stopped plowing.
F04 0440  5       The basis for compost materials already existed
F04 0450  3    on the school farm with a stable of animals for the
F04 0460  1    riding program, poultry for eggs, pigs to eat garbage,
F04 0460 10    a beef herd and wastes of all kinds. Separate pails
F04 0470  8    were kept in the kitchen for coffee grounds and egg
F04 0480  5    shells.
F04 0480  6       All these materials and supplementary manure and
F04 0490  3    other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry
F04 0500  1    farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year.
F04 0500 11    It was applied with a compost shredder made from a
F04 0510  8    converted manure spreader.
F04 0520  1       Years of patient application of compost and leaf
F04 0520  8    mulching has changed the structure of the soil and
F04 0530  7    its water-holding capacity. Soon after the method changed,
F04 0540  4    visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate his
F04 0550  2    soil to keep it looking moist, when in reality, it
F04 0550 12    was the soil treatment alone that accomplished this.
F04 0560  5       To demonstrate the soil of his vegetable gardens
F04 0570  5    as it is today, Mr& Clark stooped to scoop up a handful
F04 0580  4    of rich dark earth. Sniffing its sweet smell and letting
F04 0590  1    it fall to show its good crumbly consistency, he pointed
F04 0590 11    to the nearby driveway and said, "This soil used to
F04 0600  8    be like that hard packed road over there".
F04 0610  4       "People and soils respond slowly", says Walter Clark,
F04 0620  3    "but the time has now come when the gardens produce
F04 0630  1    delicious long-keeping vegetables due to this enrichment
F04 0630  9    program. No chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides
F04 0640  6    and fungicides are used".
F04 0650  2       The garden supplies enough carrots, turnips, rutabagas,
F04 0660  1    potatoes, beets, cabbage and squash to store for winter
F04 0660 10    meals in the root cellar. The carrots sometimes don't
F04 0670  7    make it through the winter; the cabbage and squash
F04 0680  5    keep until March or April. There is never enough corn,
F04 0690  3    peas or strawberries.
F04 0690  6       Mr& Clark still has to use rotenone with potatoes
F04 0700  6    grown on the least fertile fields, but he has watched
F04 0710  3    the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that
F04 0710 11    continued use of compost and leaf mulch will allow
F04 0720  9    him to do without it in the future. A new project planned
F04 0740  6    is the use of Bio-Dynamic Starter.
F04 0750  1       New ideas for improving nutrition came with the
F04 0750  9    study of soil treatment. "After the soil, the kitchen",
F04 0760  7    says Mr& Clark. The first major change was that of
F04 0770  7    providing wholewheat bread instead of white bread.
F04 0780  3       "Adults take a long time to convince and you are
F04 0790  1    thwarted if you try to push". At first the kitchen
F04 0790 11    help was tolerant, but ordered their own supply of
F04 0800  7    white bread for themselves. "You can't make French
F04 0810  4    toast with whole-wheat bread", was an early complaint.
F04 0820  2    Of course they learned in time that they not only could
F04 0820 13    use whole-wheat bread, but the children liked it better.
F04 0830 10    #HOMEMADE BREAD#
F04 0840  1    Mrs& Clark, as house manager, planned the menus and
F04 0840 10    cared for the ordering. Then Miss Lillian Colman came
F04 0850  8    from Vermont to be kitchen manager. Today whole grains
F04 0860  6    are freshly ground every day and baked into bread.
F04 0870  4    Mr& Clark's studies taught him that the only way to
F04 0880  3    conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt
F04 0880 12    use of the flour. Once the grains are ground, vitamin
F04 0890  8    ~E begins to deteriorate immediately and half of it
F04 0900  6    is lost by oxidation and exposure to the air within
F04 0910  3    one week.
F04 0910  5       A mill stands in a room off the kitchen. Surrounding
F04 0920  2    it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms
F04 0920 12    in the state. Miss Colman pours measures of whole wheat,
F04 0930 10    oats, and soy beans and turns on the motor. She goes
F04 0940  9    on about her work and listens for the completion of
F04 0950  5    the grinding. The bread baked from this mixture is
F04 0960  2    light in color and fragrant in aroma. It is well liked
F04 0960 13    by the children and faculty.
F04 0970  3       There is one problem with the bread. "Lillian's
F04 0980  1    bread is so good and everything tastes so much better
F04 0980 11    here that it is hard not to eat too much", said the
F04 0990 12    secretary ruefully eyeing her extra pounds.
F04 1000  4    #HOT, FRESHLY-GROUND CEREAL#
F04 1000  8    The school has not used cold prepared cereals for years,
F04 1010  8    though at one time that was all they ever served. When
F04 1020  6    the chance came, they first eliminated cold cereal
F04 1030  3    once a week, then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground
F04 1040  1    cereal every day.
F04 1040  4       They serve cracked wheat, oats or cornmeal. Occasionally,
F04 1050  2    the children find steamed, whole-wheat grains for cereal
F04 1060  1    which they call "buckshot". At the beginning of the
F04 1060 10    school year, the new students don't eat the cereal
F04 1070  8    right away, but within a short time they are eating
F04 1080  5    it voraciously.
F04 1080  7       When they leave for vacations they miss the hot
F04 1090  5    cereal. The school has received letters from parents
F04 1100  2    asking, "What happened to Johnny? He never used to
F04 1100 11    like any hot cereal, now that's the only kind he wants.
F04 1110 11    Where can we get this cereal he likes so much"?
F04 1120  8    #BODY-BUILDING FOODS#
F04 1120 11    Salads are served at least once a day. Vegetables are
F04 1130 10    served liberally. Most come from the root cellar or
F04 1140  7    from the freezer. Home-made sauerkraut is served once
F04 1150  4    a week. Sprouted grains and seeds are used in salads
F04 1160  1    and dishes such as chop suey. Sometimes sprouted wheat
F04 1160 10    is added to bread and causes the children to remark,
F04 1170  8    "Lillian, did you put nuts in the bread today"?
F04 1180  5       Milk appears twice a day. The school raises enough
F04 1190  3    poultry, pigs, and beef cattle for most of their needs.
F04 1200  1    Lots of cheese made from June grass milk is served.
F04 1200 11    Hens are kept on the range and roosters are kept with
F04 1210  9    them for their fertility.
F04 1220  1       Organ meats such as beef and chicken liver, tongue
F04 1220 10    and heart are planned once a week. Also, salt water
F04 1230  8    fish is on the table once a week.
F04 1240  1       For deserts, puddings and pies are each served once
F04 1240 10    a week. Most other desserts are fruit in some form,
F04 1250  9    fresh fruits once daily at least, sometimes at snack
F04 1260  6    time. Dried fruits are purchased from sources where
F04 1270  2    they are neither sulphured nor sprayed. Apples come
F04 1271  1    from a farm in Vermont where they are not sprayed.
F04 1280 10    Oranges and grapefruit are shipped from Florida weekly
F04 1290  6    from an organic farm.
F04 1290 10       Finding sources for these high quality foods is
F04 1300  8    a problem. Sometimes the solution comes in unexpected
F04 1310  5    ways. Following a talk by Mr& Clark at the New York
F04 1320  5    State Natural Food Associates Convention, a man from
F04 1330  2    the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to
F04 1330 11    the school from Vermont.
F04 1340  3       Wheat-germ, brewer's yeast and ground kelp are used
F04 1350  2    in bread and in dishes such as spaghetti sauce, meat
F04 1350 12    loaves. Miss Colman hopes to find suitable shakers
F04 1360  7    so that kelp can be available at the tables. Raw wheat-germ
F04 1370  7    is available on the breakfast table for the children
F04 1380  4    to help themselves.
F04 1380  7       Very few fried foods are used and the use of salt
F04 1390  7    and pepper is discouraged. Drinking with meals is also
F04 1400  3    discouraged; pitchers of water merely appear on the
F04 1400 11    tables.
F04 1410  1       Nothing is peeled. The source is known so there
F04 1410 10    is no necessity to remove insecticide residues. The
F04 1420  6    cooking conserves a maximum of the vitamin ~C content
F04 1430  6    of vegetables by methods which use very little water
F04 1440  3    and cook in the shortest time possible.
F04 1440 10    #WHOLESOME SNACKS, NO CANDY#
F04 1450  3    Since Mr& Clark believes firmly that the chewing of
F04 1460  2    hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth, raw
F04 1460 11    vegetables and raw whole-wheat grains are handed out
F04 1470  8    with fresh fruit and whole-wheat cookies at snack time
F04 1480  5    in the afternoons. To solve the problem of the wheat
F04 1490  2    grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot,
F04 1490 10    a ball of maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was
F04 1500  8    invented to hold the grains.
F04 1510  1       On their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains,
F04 1510  9    the children carry whole grains to munch along the
F04 1520  8    trail. They learn to like these so well that it isn't
F04 1540  7    surprising to hear that one boy tried the oats he was
F04 1550  4    feeding his horse at chore time. They tasted good to
F04 1550 14    him, so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his
F04 1560 11    cereal bowl with milk and honey.
F04 1570  3       Maple syrup is made by the children in the woods
F04 1580  1    on the school grounds. This and raw sugar replace ordinary
F04 1580 11    refined sugar on the tables and very little sugar is
F04 1590  9    used in cooking. Candy is not allowed. Parents are
F04 1600  5    asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats consisting
F04 1610  2    of fruit and nuts, but no candy.
F04 1610  9    #NOURISHING MEALS#
F04 1620  1    Mr& Clark believes in a good full breakfast of fruit,
F04 1620 11    hot cereal, milk, honey, whole-wheat toast with real
F04 1630  8    butter and eggs. The heavy meal comes in the middle
F04 1640  6    of the day. Soup is often the important dish at supper.
F04 1650  3    Homemade of meat, bones and vegetables, it is rich
F04 1650 12    in dissolved minerals and vitamins.
F04 1660  4       The school finds that the children are satisfied
F04 1670  3    with smaller amounts of food since all of it is high
F04 1680  1    in quality. The cost to feed one person is just under
F04 1680 12    one dollar a day.
F04 1690  2    #OUTDOOR EXERCISES#
F04 1690  4    Even before he saw the necessity of growing better
F04 1700  2    food and planning good nutrition, Mr& Clark felt the
F04 1700 11    school had a good health program. Rugged outdoor exercise
F04 1710  9    for an hour and a half every day in all kinds of weather
F04 1720 10    was the rule. A vigorous program existed in skiing,
F04 1730  5    skating sports and overnight hiking.
F04 1730 10    #HEALTHIER CHILDREN#
F04 1740  2    Since the change to better nutrition, he feels he can
F04 1750  2    report on improvements in health, though he considers
F04 1750 10    the following statements observations and not scientific
F04 1760  6    proof.
F04 1760  7       Visitors to the school ask what shampoo they use
F04 1770  8    on the children's hair to bring out the sheen. The
F04 1780  5    ruddy complexion of the faces also brings comment.
F05 0010  1       BUFFETED by swirling winds, the little green biplane
F05 0010  9    struggled northward between the mountains beyond Northfield
F05 0020  7    Gulf. Wires whined as a cold November blast rocked
F05 0030  8    the silver wings, but the engine roar was reassuring
F05 0040  4    to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit. He peered
F05 0050  2    ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into
F05 0050 11    view again below.
F05 0060  2       "Good old iron compass"! he thought.
F05 0060  8       A plume of smoke rose from a Central Vermont locomotive
F05 0070  9    which idled behind a string of gravel cars, and little
F05 0080  8    figures that were workmen labored to set the ruptured
F05 0090  5    roadbed to rights. The girders of a shattered Dog River
F05 0100  3    bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream. Vermont's
F05 0110  1    main railroad line was prostrate. And in the dark days
F05 0110 11    after the Great Flood of 1927- the worst natural disaster
F05 0120  8    in the state's history- the little plane was its sole
F05 0130  9    replacement in carrying the United States mails.
F05 0150  3       Rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen for
F05 0160  2    three full days and it was still raining on the morning
F05 0160 13    of Friday, November 4, 1927, when officials of the
F05 0170  8    Post Office Department's Railway Mail Service realized
F05 0180  5    that their distribution system for Vermont had been
F05 0190  4    almost totally destroyed overnight. Clerks and postmasters
F05 0200  1    shoveled muck out of their offices- those who still
F05 0200 10    had offices- and wondered how to move the mail. The
F05 0210 11    state's railroad system counted miles of broken bridges
F05 0220  6    and missing rights-of-way: it would obviously remain
F05 0230  3    out of commission for weeks. And once medicine, food,
F05 0240  2    clothing and shelter had been provided for the flood's
F05 0240 11    victims, communications and the mail were the next
F05 0250  8    top problems.
F05 0250 10       From Burlington, outgoing mail could be ferried
F05 0260  7    across Lake Champlain to the railroad at Port Kent,
F05 0270  7    N& Y&. But what came in was piling up. The nearest
F05 0280  4    undisrupted end of track from Boston was at Concord,
F05 0290  1    N& H&. When Governor Al Smith offered New York National
F05 0300  1    Guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state,
F05 0300 13    it seemed a likely temporary solution, easing Burlington's
F05 0310  7    bottleneck and that at Montpelier too.
F05 0320  4       The question was "Where to land"? There was no such
F05 0330  5    thing as an airport in Vermont. Burlington aviator
F05 0340  1    John J& Burns suggested the parade ground southwest
F05 0340  9    of Fort Ethan Allen, and soon a dozen hastily-summoned
F05 0350  9    National Guard pilots were bringing their wide-winged
F05 0360  6    "Jenny" and DeHaviland two-seaters to rest on the frozen
F05 0370  6    sod of the military base.
F05 0370 11       The only available field that could be used near
F05 0380  8    flood-ravaged Montpelier was on the Towne farm off
F05 0390  6    upper Main Street, a narrow hillside where takeoffs
F05 0400  2    and landings could be safely made only under light
F05 0400 11    wind conditions. Over in Barre the streets had been
F05 0410  8    deep in swirling water, and bridges were crumpled and
F05 0420  5    gone. Anticipating delivery of medicines and yeast
F05 0430  3    by plane, Granite City citizens formed an airfield
F05 0430 11    committee and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172nd
F05 0440 10    Infantry, Vermont National Guard, laid out runways
F05 0450  5    on Wilson flat, high on Millstone Hill. The "Barre
F05 0460  3    Aviation Field" was set to receive its first aircraft
F05 0470  2    the Sunday following the flood.
F05 0470  7       Though the makeshift airports were ready, the York
F05 0480  6    State Guard flyers proved unable to keep any kind of
F05 0490  5    mail schedule. They had courage but their meager training
F05 0500  1    consisted of weekend hops in good weather, in and out
F05 0500 11    of established airports, And the increasingly cold
F05 0510  6    weather soon raised hob with the water cooled engines
F05 0520  5    of their World War /1, planes. It seemed like a good
F05 0530  4    time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering
F05 0540  1    the post office department to contract for the transport
F05 0540 10    of first class mail by air. They had to act fast, for
F05 0550 11    letters were clogging the terminals.
F05 0560  2       Down in Concord, New Hampshire, was a flier in the
F05 0570  3    right place at the right time: Robert S& Fogg, a native
F05 0580  1    New Englander, had been a World War /1, flying instructor,
F05 0580 11    barnstormer, and one of the original planners of the
F05 0590  9    Concord Airport. Tall, wiry, dark-haired Bob Fogg had
F05 0600  7    already racked up one historical first in air mail
F05 0610  5    history. Piloting a Curtiss Navy ~MF flying boat off
F05 0620  3    Lake Winnipesaukee in 1925, he had inaugurated the
F05 0620 11    original Rural Delivery air service in America.
F05 0630  7       During the excitement following Lindbergh's flight
F05 0640  4    to Paris earlier in 1927, dare devil aviators overnight
F05 0650  3    became legendary heroes. In Concord, Bob Fogg was the
F05 0670  3    most prominent New Hampshire boy with wings. Public-spirited
F05 0680  1    backers staked him to a brand-new airplane, aimed at
F05 0680 11    putting their city and state on the flying map. The
F05 0690  9    ship was a Waco biplane, one of the first two of its
F05 0700  7    type to be fitted with the air cooled, 225~HP Wright
F05 0710  2    radial engine known as the Whirlwind. A trim green
F05 0710 11    and silver-painted craft only 22-1/2 feet long, the
F05 0720  8    Waco was entered to compete in the "On-to-Spokane"
F05 0730  7    Air Derby of 1927. As a matter of fact, Fogg and his
F05 0740  6    plane didn't get beyond Pennsylvania in the race- an
F05 0750  2    engine oil leak forced him down- but the flying service
F05 0760  1    and school he started subsequently were first steps
F05 0760  9    in paying off his wry-faced backers. So with all this
F05 0770  8    experience, Bob Fogg was a natural choice to receive
F05 0780  4    the first Emergency Air Mail Star Route contract. His
F05 0790  2    work began just six days after the flood.
F05 0790 10       By airline from Concord to Burlington is a distance
F05 0800  8    of about 150 miles, counting a slight deviation for
F05 0810  5    the stop at either Barre or Montpelier. The first few
F05 0820  4    days Bob Fogg set his plane down on Towne field back
F05 0830  1    of the State House when the wind was right, and used
F05 0830 12    Wilson flat above Barre when it wasn't. Between the
F05 0840  8    unsafe Towne field and the long roundabout back road
F05 0850  5    haul that was necessary to gain access to Wilson flat,
F05 0860  3    arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory.
F05 0870  1    Each time in, the unhappy pilot, pushing his luck,
F05 0870 10    begged the postal officials that met him to find a
F05 0880  8    safer landing place, preferably on the flat-topped
F05 0890  5    hills across the Winooski River.
F05 0890 10       "But Fogg", they countered, "we can't get over there.
F05 0900  9    And besides you seem to make it all right here". It
F05 0910  9    took a tragedy to bring things to a head. After a week
F05 0920  7    of precarious uphill landings and downwind takeoffs,
F05 0930  2    Fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage
F05 0940  1    of an Army plane strewn across snow-covered Towne field.
F05 0940 11    Sent to Montpelier by Secretary Herbert Hoover, Red
F05 0950  7    Cross Aide Reuben Sleight had been killed, and his
F05 0960  7    pilot, Lt& Franklin Wolfe, badly injured. With the
F05 0970  4    field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply
F05 0980  1    flown into the hillside.
F05 0980  5       Faced with this situation, Postmaster Charles F&
F05 0990  3    McKenna of Montpelier went with Fogg on a Burlington
F05 1000  1    trip, and together they scouted the terrain on the
F05 1000 10    heights of Berlin. A long flat known as the St& John
F05 1010 11    field seemed to answer their purpose, and since the
F05 1020  6    Winooski bridges were at last passable, they decided
F05 1030  3    to use it.
F05 1030  6       With a wary eye on the farmer's bull, Fred Somers
F05 1040  4    of Montpelier and Mr& St& John marked the field with
F05 1050  3    a red table cloth. As a wind direction indicator, they
F05 1050 13    tied a cotton rag to a sapling. With these aids, and
F05 1060 11    a pair of skiis substituting for wheels on the Waco,
F05 1070  6    Bob Fogg made the first landing on what is now part
F05 1080  5    of the Barre-Montpelier Airport on November 21, 1927.
F05 1090  2       Each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with
F05 1090 11    mail pouches. During the second week of operations,
F05 1100  8    Fogg received a telegram from the Post Office Department,
F05 1110  6    asking him to "put on two airplanes and make two flights
F05 1120  5    daily, plus one Sunday trip". Since Fogg's was a one-man,
F05 1130  6    one-plane flying service, this meant that he would
F05 1140  2    have to do both trips, flying alone 600 miles a day,
F05 1140 13    under sub-freezing temperature conditions.
F05 1150  3       Over the weeks, America's first Star Route Air Mail
F05 1160  6    settled into a routine pattern despite the vagaries
F05 1170  2    of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids
F05 1170 12    to navigation. Each morning at five Fogg crawled out
F05 1180  8    of bed to bundle into flying togs over the furnace
F05 1190  6    register of his home. Always troubled by poor circulation
F05 1200  4    in his feet, he experimented with various combinations
F05 1210  1    of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style
F05 1210 10    felt farmer's boots with his sheepskin flying boots
F05 1220  7    pulled over them. A sheep-lined leather flying suit,
F05 1230  4    plus helmet, goggles and mittens completed his attire
F05 1240  3    for the rigors of the open cockpit. The airman's stock
F05 1240 13    answer to "Weren't you cold"? became "Yes, the first
F05 1250  9    half hour is tough, but by then I'm so numb I don't
F05 1260 11    notice it"!
F05 1270  1       As daylight began to show through the frosty windows,
F05 1270 10    Fogg would place a call to William A& Shaw at the U&
F05 1280 11    S& Weather Station at Northfield, Vermont, for temperature
F05 1290  6    and wind-velocity readings. Shaw could also give the
F05 1300  6    flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility by a visual
F05 1310  4    check of the mountains to be seen from his station.
F05 1320  1    "Ceilings" were judged by comparison with known mountain
F05 1320  9    heights and cloud positions. Later on in the day Fogg
F05 1330 10    could get a better weather picture from the Burlington
F05 1340  5    Weather Bureau supervised by Frank E& Hartwell.
F05 1350  3       Out at the airport each morning, Fogg's skilled
F05 1360  2    mechanic Caleb Marston would have the Waco warmed up
F05 1360 11    and running in the drafty hangar. (He'd get the engine
F05 1370  9    oil flowing with an electric heater under a big canvas
F05 1380  7    cover.) Wishing to show that aviation was dependable
F05 1390  3    and here to stay, Bob Fogg always made a point of taking
F05 1400  3    off each morning on the dot of seven, disregarding
F05 1400 12    rain, snow and sleet in true postal tradition. Concord
F05 1410  8    learned to set its clocks by the rackety bark of the
F05 1420  7    Whirlwind's exhaust overhead. Sometimes the pilot had
F05 1430  4    to turn back if fully blocked by fog, but 85% of his
F05 1440  1    trips were completed.
F05 1440  4       Plane radios were not yet available, and once in
F05 1450  4    the air, Fogg flew his ship by compass, a good memory
F05 1450 15    for landmarks as seen from above, and a capacity for
F05 1460 10    dead reckoning and quick computation. Often, threading
F05 1470  4    through the overcast, he was forced to fly close to
F05 1480  5    the ground by a low ceiling, skimming above the Winooski
F05 1490  1    or the White River along the line of the broken railroad.
F05 1490 12    When driving rain or mist socked in one valley, Fogg
F05 1500 10    would chandelle up and over to reverse course and try
F05 1510  8    another one, ranging from the Ottauquechee up to Danville
F05 1520  4    in search of safe passage through the mountain passes.
F05 1530  2       The dependable Wright engine was never stopped on
F05 1540  1    these trips. It ticked over smoothly, idling while
F05 1540  9    Fogg exchanged mails with the armed messenger from
F05 1550  7    Burlington at Fort Ethan Allen, and one from Montpelier
F05 1560  5    and Barre at the St& John field.
F05 1570  1       Sometimes, on a return trip, the aviator would "go
F05 1570 10    upstairs" high over the clouds. There he'd take a compass
F05 1580  9    heading, figure his air speed, and deduce that in a
F05 1590  8    certain number of minutes he'd be over the broad meadows
F05 1600  4    of the Merrimack Valley where it would be safe to let
F05 1610  3    down through the overcast and see the ground before
F05 1610 12    it hit him. Bob Fogg didn't have today's advantages
F05 1620  7    of Instrument Flight and Ground Control Approach systems.
F05 1630  6    At the end of the calculated time he'd nose the Waco
F05 1640  6    down through the cloud bank and hope to break through
F05 1650  2    where some feature of the winter landscape would be
F05 1650 11    recognizable.
F05 1660  1       Usually back in Concord by noon, there was just
F05 1660 10    time to get partially thawed out, refuel, and grab
F05 1670  9    a bit of Mrs& Fogg's hot broth before starting the
F05 1680  6    second trip. Day after day Fogg shuttled back and forth
F05 1690  4    on his one-man air mail route, until the farmers in
F05 1700  2    their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to
F05 1700 11    recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest
F05 1710  9    of the country.
F05 1710 12       The flyer had his share of near-misses. At Fort
F05 1720 10    Ethan Allen the ever-present wind off Lake Champlain
F05 1730  5    could readily flip a puny man-made thing like an airplane
F05 1740  4    if the pilot miscalculated. Once the soldiers from
F05 1750  1    the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away
F05 1750 11    while Fogg revved the engine and got the tail up. At
F05 1760  9    a nod of his head they let go, turning to cup their
F05 1770  5    ears against the icy slipstream. Tracks in the snow
F05 1780  2    showed the plane was airborne in less than a hundred
F05 1780 12    feet.
F05 1790  1       One afternoon during a cold, powdery snowstorm,
F05 1790  8    Fogg took off for Concord from the St& John field.
F06 0010  1    Are you retiring now? If so, are you saying, "Where
F06 0010 11    did the last few years go? How did I get to be sixty-five
F06 0020 12    so fast? What do I do now"?
F06 0030  4       Yes, retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly.
F06 0040  1    Somehow we old-timers never figured we would ever retire.
F06 0040 11    We always thought we would die with our boots on. Out
F06 0050 10    of the blue comes talk of pension plans. Compulsory
F06 0060  5    retirement at sixty-five looms on our horizon. Still,
F06 0070  3    it seems in the far future. Suddenly, one day, up it
F06 0080  1    pops! Sixty-five years and you've had it!
F06 0080  9       So, now what? Oh sure! You've thought about it before
F06 0090  8    in a hazy sort of way. But! It never seemed real; never
F06 0100  7    seemed as if it could happen to you; only to the other
F06 0110  7    fellow.
F06 0110  8       Now! Here it is! How am I going to live? What am
F06 0120  8    I going to do? Where do I go from here?
F06 0130  2       A great many retired people are the so-called white
F06 0140  1    collar workers. Are you one of these?
F06 0140  8       If so, you are of the old school. You are conscientious,
F06 0150  6    hard working, honest, accurate, a good penman, and
F06 0160  5    a stickler for a job well done, with no loose ends.
F06 0170  1    Everything must balance to the last penny. Also you
F06 0170 10    can spell, without consulting a dictionary for every
F06 0180  6    other word. You never are late for work and seldom
F06 0190  5    absent.
F06 0190  6    ##
F06 0190  7    Actually, you can take no special credit for this.
F06 0200  4    It is the way you were taught and your way of life.
F06 0210  2    All this is standard equipment for a man of your day;
F06 0210 13    your stock in trade; your livelihood.
F06 0220  5       However, the last few years of your life, things
F06 0230  5    seem to be changing. Your way doesn't seem to be so
F06 0240  3    darned important any more. You realize you are getting
F06 0240 12    in the old fogy class. To put it bluntly, you are getting
F06 0250 10    out-moded.
F06 0260  1       What's happened? The answer is a new era.
F06 0260  8       Now, looming on the horizon are such things as estimated
F06 0270  8    totals, calculated risks and I&B&M& machines. The Planning
F06 0280  5    Dept& comes into existence. All sorts of plans come
F06 0290  6    to life. This is followed by a boom in conferences.
F06 0300  1    Yes sir! Conferences become very popular. When a plan
F06 0310  1    burst its seams, hasty conferences supply the necessary
F06 0310  9    patch, and life goes merrily on. That's called progress!
F06 0320  7    The new way of life! Let's face it! You had your day
F06 0330  8    and it was a good day. Let this generation have theirs.
F06 0340  4    Time marches on!
F06 0340  7       Well, to get back to the problem of retirement.
F06 0350  6    Every retiring person has a different situation facing
F06 0360  3    him. Some have plenty of money- some have very little
F06 0370  1    money. Some are blest with an abundance of good health-
F06 0370 11    some are in poor health and many are invalids. Some
F06 0380 10    have lovely homes- some live in small apartments. Some
F06 0390  7    have beautiful gardens- some not even a blade of grass.
F06 0400  6    Some have serenity of mind, the ability to accept what
F06 0410  2    they have, and make the most of it (a wonderful gift
F06 0410 13    to have, believe me)- some see only darkness, the bitter
F06 0420  9    side of everything. Well, whatever you have, that's
F06 0430  6    it! You've got to learn to live with it.
F06 0440  4       Now! The question is "How are you going to live
F06 0450  2    with it"?
F06 0450  4    ##
F06 0450  5    You can sit back and moan and bewail your lot. Yes!
F06 0460  3    You can do this. But, if you do, your life will be
F06 0470  2    just one thing- unhappiness- complete and unabridged.
F06 0470  9       It seems to me, the first thing you've got to do,
F06 0480 11    to be happy, is to face up to your problems, no matter
F06 0490  8    what they may be. Make up your mind to pool your resources
F06 0500  5    and get the most out of your remaining years of life.
F06 0510  3    One thing, I am sure of, you must get an interest in
F06 0510 15    life. You've got to do something.
F06 0520  6       Many of you will say, "Well, what can I do"?
F06 0530  5       Believe me! There are many, many things to do. Find
F06 0540  4    out what you like to do most and really give it a whirl.
F06 0550  1    If you can't think of a thing to do, try something-
F06 0550 12    anything. Maybe you will surprise yourself.
F06 0560  6       True! We are not all great artists. I, frankly,
F06 0570  4    can't draw a straight line. Maybe you are not that
F06 0580  3    gifted either, but how about puttering around with
F06 0580 11    the old paints? You may amaze yourself and acquire
F06 0590  7    a real knack for it. Anyway, I'll bet you have a lot
F06 0600  7    of fun.
F06 0600  9       Do you like to sew? Does making your own clothes
F06 0610  5    or even doll clothes, interest you? Do you love to
F06 0620  4    run up a hem, sew on buttons, make neat buttonholes?
F06 0620 14    If you do, go to it. There is always a market for this
F06 0630 13    line of work. Some women can sit and sew, crochet,
F06 0640  7    tat or knit by the hour, and look calm and relaxed
F06 0650  4    and turn out beautiful work. Where sewing is concerned,
F06 0660  1    I'm a total loss. When you see a needle in my hands
F06 0660 13    you will know the family buttons have fallen off and
F06 0670  9    I have to sew them back on, or get out the safety pins.
F06 0680  7       Then again, there's always that lovely old pastime
F06 0690  4    of hooking or braiding rugs. Not for me, but perhaps
F06 0700  1    just the thing for you.
F06 0700  6       Well! How's about mosaic tile, ceramics or similar
F06 0710  5    arts and crafts? Some people love to crack tile and
F06 0720  4    it's amazing what beautiful designs they come up with
F06 0730  1    as a result of their cracking good time.
F06 0730  9       How about the art of cooking? Do you yearn to make
F06 0740  7    cakes and pies, or special cookies and candies? There
F06 0750  4    is always an open market for this sort of delicacy,
F06 0760  1    in spite of low calorie diets, cottage cheese and
F06 0760 10    hands-off-all-sweets
F06 0770  1    to the contrary.
F06 0770  4       Some people can carve most anything out of a piece
F06 0780  4    of wood. Some make beautiful chairs, cabinets, chests,
F06 0780 12    doll houses, etc&. Perhaps you couldn't do that but
F06 0800  7    have you ever tried to see what you could do with a
F06 0810  9    hunk of wood? Outside of cutting your fingers, maybe
F06 0820  3    you would come up with nothing at all, but then again,
F06 0830  1    you might turn out some dandy little gadgets.
F06 0830  9       Some women get a real thrill out of housework. They
F06 0840  8    love to dust, scrub, polish, wax floors, move the furniture
F06 0850  6    around from place to place, take down the curtains,
F06 0860  2    put up new ones and have themselves a real ball. Maybe
F06 0860 13    that's your forte. It certainly isn't mine. I can look
F06 0870 10    at furniture in one spot year in and year out and really
F06 0880 11    feel for sure that's where it belongs.
F06 0890  4    ##
F06 0890  5    Perhaps you would like to become a writer. This gives
F06 0900  3    you a wide and varied choice. Will it be short stories,
F06 0910  1    fiction, nonfiction, biography, poetry, children's
F06 0910  6    stories, or even a book if you are really ambitious?
F06 0920  8       Ever since I was a child, I have always had a yen
F06 0930  8    to try my hand at writing. If you do decide to write,
F06 0940  4    you will soon become acquainted with rejection slips
F06 0950  1    and dejection. Don't be discouraged! This is just being
F06 0950 10    a normal writer. Just let the rejection slips fall
F06 0960  8    where they may, and keep on plugging, and finally you
F06 0970  6    will make the grade. Few new writers have their first
F06 0980  3    story accepted, so they tell me. But, it could happen,
F06 0990  1    and it may happen to you.
F06 0990  7       Then there's always hobbies, collecting stamps,
F06 1000  2    coins, timetables, salt and pepper shakers, elephants,
F06 1010  1    dogs, dolls, shells, or shall we just say collecting
F06 1010 10    anything your heart desires?
F06 1020  2       I can hear some of you folks protesting. You say,
F06 1030  1    "But it costs a lot of money to have a hobby. I haven't
F06 1030 14    got that kind of money".
F06 1040  4       True! It does cost a lot of money for most hobbies
F06 1050  3    but there are hobbies that are for free. How about
F06 1050 13    a rock collection, or a collection of leaves from different
F06 1060  9    trees or shrubs and in different colors? Then, take
F06 1070  7    flowers. They are many and varied. Also, there's scrap
F06 1080  4    books, collecting newspaper pictures and clippings,
F06 1090  2    or any items of interest to you. It's getting interested
F06 1100  1    in something that counts.
F06 1100  5    ##
F06 1100  6    As for me, I am holding in reserve two huge puzzles
F06 1110  4    (I love puzzles) to put together when time hangs heavy
F06 1120  2    on my hands. So far, the covers have never been off
F06 1120 13    the boxes. I just don't have time to do half the things
F06 1130 12    I want to do now.
F06 1140  1       So in closing, fellow retired members, I advise
F06 1140  9    you to make the most of each day, enjoy each one to
F06 1150 10    the ~n'th degree. Travel, if you can. Keep occupied
F06 1160  6    to the point you are not bored with life and you will
F06 1170  4    truly find these final days and years of your lives
F06 1170 14    to be sunshine sweet.
F06 1180  4       Good Luck! To one and all- Good Days ahead! An important
F06 1200  3    criterion of maturity is creativity. The mature person
F06 1210  1    is creative. What does it mean to be creative, a term
F06 1210 12    we hear with increasing frequency these days? When
F06 1220  5    we turn to Noah Webster we find him helpful as usual.
F06 1230  5    "To be creative is to have the ability to cause to
F06 1240  3    exist- to produce where nothing was before- to bring
F06 1240 12    forth an original production of human intelligence
F06 1250  7    or power". We are creative, it seems, when we produce
F06 1260  6    something which has not previously existed. Thus creativity
F06 1270  3    may run all the way from making a cake, building a
F06 1280  2    chicken coop, or producing a book, to founding a business,
F06 1280 12    creating a League of Nations or, developing a mature
F06 1290  9    character.
F06 1290 10       All living creatures from the lowest form of insect
F06 1300  9    or animal life evidence the power of creativity, if
F06 1310  6    it is only to reproduce a form like their own. While
F06 1320  3    man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors
F06 1330  1    in the evolutionary process, he is the only animal
F06 1330 10    with a true non-instinctive and conscious creative
F06 1340  6    ability. An animal, bird or insect creates either a
F06 1350  5    burrow, or nest or hive in unending sameness according
F06 1360  2    to specie. Man's great superiority over these evolutionary
F06 1370  1    forbears is in the development of his imagination.
F06 1370  9    This gives him the power to form in his mind new image
F06 1380  9    combinations of old memories, ideas and experiences
F06 1390  3    and to project them outside of himself into his environment
F06 1400  1    in new and ever-changing forms.
F06 1400  7    ##
F06 1400  8    It has been truly said that anything man can imagine
F06 1410  6    he can produce or create by projecting this inner image
F06 1420  4    into its counterpart in the objective world. In our
F06 1430  1    own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of
F06 1430 11    a Jules Verne come into actuality. The vision of a
F06 1440  8    Lord Tennyson expressed in a poem 100 years ago took
F06 1450  6    visible form over London in the air blitzes of 1941.
F06 1460  2    In fact all of our civilized world is the resultant
F06 1460 12    of man's projection of his imagination over the past
F06 1470  8    60 centuries or more. It is in this one aspect, at
F06 1480  7    least, that man seems to be made in the image of his
F06 1490  3    Creator.
F06 1490  4       Not only can man project his imagination out into
F06 1500  3    his environment in concrete forms, but even more importantly,
F06 1510  1    he can turn it inward to help create new and better
F06 1510 12    forms of himself. We recognize that young people through
F06 1520  7    imaginative mind and body training can become athletes,
F06 1530  4    acrobats, dancers, musicians and artists, developing
F06 1540  1    many potentialities. We know that actors can learn
F06 1540  9    to portray a wide variety of character roles. By this
F06 1550  9    same combination of the will and the imagination, each
F06 1560  6    one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind
F06 1570  3    of character we would like to be. We must realize with
F06 1580  1    Prof& Charles Morris in his THE OPEN SELF that "Man
F06 1580 11    is the being that can continually remake himself, the
F06 1590  8    artisan that is himself the material for his own creation".
F06 1600  7    ##
F06 1600  8    So far in history man has been too greatly over-occupied
F06 1610  7    with projecting things into his environment rather
F06 1620  2    than first creating the sort of person who can make
F06 1630  1    the highest use of the things he has created. Is not
F06 1630 12    the present world crisis a race between things we have
F06 1640  8    created which can now destroy us and between populations
F06 1650  4    of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall the
F06 1660  2    tragedy. Is it not the obligation of us older citizens
F06 1660 12    to lend our weight to being creative on the character
F06 1670  9    side and to hasten our own maturing process?
F06 1680  4       Sir Julian Huxley in his book UNIQUENESS OF MAN
F06 1690  3    makes the novel point that just as man is unique in
F06 1700  1    being the only animal which requires a long period
F06 1700 10    of infancy and childhood under family protection, so
F06 1710  5    is he the only animal who has a long period after the
F06 1720  4    decline of his procreativity.
F07 0010  1       SOME recent writings assume that the ignorant young
F07 0010  9    couples are a thing of the remote, Victorian past;
F07 0020  9    that nowadays all honeymooners are thoroughly familiar
F07 0030  4    with the best sex-manuals and know enough from talk
F07 0040  3    with friends and personal experimentation to take all
F07 0050  1    the anxiety and hazards out of the situation.
F07 0050  9       Perhaps- but extensive discussions with contemporary
F07 0060  4    practitioners, family doctors and gynecologists indicate
F07 0070  3    that this is still an area of enormous ignorance. Joking
F07 0080  2    and talking may be freer and easier, but the important
F07 0080 12    factual information is still lacking for far too many
F07 0090  9    newly-married men and women.
F07 0100  3       Various factors in the setting can still be of great
F07 0110  1    advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather
F07 0110 10    than a bad memory for one or both. Privacy must be
F07 0120  9    highly assured both in time and place. That is, locking
F07 0130  5    the room or stateroom door gives privacy of location,
F07 0140  2    but it is equally important to be sure there is time
F07 0140 13    enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment.
F07 0150  6       If the wedding party lasted late, and the travel
F07 0160  5    schedule means there are only a few hours before resuming
F07 0170  2    the trip or making an early start, the husband may
F07 0170 12    forestall tensions and uncertainties by confiding to
F07 0180  7    his bride that lying in each other's arms will be bliss
F07 0190  8    enough for these few hours. The consummation should
F07 0200  3    come at the next stopping place when they have a long
F07 0210  1    private time (day or night) for that purpose.
F07 0210  9    ##
F07 0210 10    First intercourse for the bride brings with it the
F07 0220  8    various problems connected with virginity and the hymen.
F07 0230  6       One thing should be clear to both husband and wife-
F07 0240  5    neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur when
F07 0250  2    the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act. Ignorance
F07 0250 12    on this point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety,
F07 0260 10    misunderstanding and suspicion.
F07 0270  3       The hymen is, in essence, a fragile membrane that
F07 0280  2    more or less completely covers the entrance to the
F07 0280 11    vagina in most female human beings who have not had
F07 0290  8    sex relations. (Hymen, in fact, is the Greek word for
F07 0300  6    membrane.)
F07 0300  7       Often it is thin and fragile and gives way readily
F07 0310  5    to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse.
F07 0320  1    As might be expected, girls in this situation bleed
F07 0320 10    very little and perhaps not at all in the process of
F07 0330 10    losing their virginity.
F07 0340  1       It is also important to realize that many girls
F07 0340 10    are born without a hymen or at most only a tiny trace
F07 0350 10    of one; so that the absence of the hymen is by no means
F07 0360  8    positive proof that a girl has had sex relations.
F07 0370  2       But there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations
F07 0380  1    of the folk-lore beliefs. Some hymens are so strongly
F07 0380 11    developed that they cannot be torn without considerable
F07 0390  7    pain to the girl and marked loss of blood. More rarely,
F07 0400  6    the hymen is so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration.
F07 0410  4       Extreme cases are on record in which the doctor
F07 0430  1    has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen
F07 0430 11    to permit marital relations to be consummated. These
F07 0440  6    cases, for all their rarity, are so dramatic that friends
F07 0450  5    and relations repeat the story until the general population
F07 0460  2    may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen
F07 0470  1    is a serious problem to newly-weds.
F07 0475  1    ##
F07 0475  2    In recent times, when sexual matters began to be discussed
F07 0480  6    more scientifically and more openly, the emotional
F07 0490  3    aspects of virginity received considerable attention.
F07 0500  1    Obviously, the bridal pair has many adjustments to
F07 0500  9    make to their new situation. Is it necessary to add
F07 0510  7    to the other tensions the hazard of making the loving
F07 0520  4    husband the one who brought pain to his bride?
F07 0530  1       Gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise
F07 0530  8    that the bride should consult a physician before marriage.
F07 0540  7    If he foresaw any problem because of the quality of
F07 0550  6    the hymen, it was recommended that simple procedures
F07 0560  2    be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or, preferably,
F07 0570  1    to dilate it.
F07 0570  4       As a natural outgrowth of this approach it was often
F07 0580  2    suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation
F07 0580 10    for painless intercourse by dilating the vagina.
F07 0590  7       This recommendation was based on the fact that the
F07 0600  8    hymen was not the only barrier to smooth consummation
F07 0610  2    of the sex act. The vagina is an organ capable of remarkable
F07 0620  2    contraction and dilation. This is obvious when it is
F07 0620 11    remembered that, during childbirth, the vagina must
F07 0630  7    dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby.
F07 0640  6       The intricate system of muscles that manage the
F07 0650  3    contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly
F07 0650 11    under voluntary control. But an instinctive reflex
F07 0660  7    may work against the conscious intention of the woman.
F07 0670  5    That is, when first penetration takes place, the pressure
F07 0680  4    and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the vaginal
F07 0690  2    muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion
F07 0690 12    and prevent further pain.
F07 0700  3    ##
F07 0700  4    The advantages of dilatation by the physician are both
F07 0710  3    physical and psychological. Since it is a purely professional
F07 0720  1    situation, none of the pain is associated with love-making
F07 0720 11    or the beloved. By using instruments of gradually increasing
F07 0730  8    size, the vagina is gently, and with minimum pain at
F07 0740  8    each stage, taught to yield to an object of the appropriate
F07 0750  6    shape.
F07 0750  7       In this process the vaginal muscles come under better
F07 0760  5    conscious control by the girl. She learns how to relax
F07 0770  4    them to accept- instead of contracting them to repel
F07 0780  1    the entering object.
F07 0780  4       Apart from the standard problem of controlling the
F07 0790  3    vaginal muscles, other serious barriers may exist that
F07 0800  1    need special gynecological treatment. It is far better
F07 0800  9    to have such conditions treated in advance than to
F07 0810  7    have them show up on the honeymoon where they can create
F07 0820  5    a really serious situation.
F07 0820  9       When no medical problems exist, the newly married
F07 0830  7    couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustments
F07 0840  5    of their new relationship by themselves. Special information
F07 0850  2    and guidance about the possible difficulties are still
F07 0860  1    of great value. Folk-lore, superstition and remembered
F07 0860  9    passages from erotic literature can create physical
F07 0870  6    and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific
F07 0880  4    facts and useful hints.
F07 0880  8    ##
F07 0880  9    The importance of loving tenderness is obvious. The
F07 0890  7    long, unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation
F07 0900  4    of fore-play work on several levels. Under the excitement
F07 0910  3    of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes
F07 0920  1    and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases,
F07 0920  9    providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an
F07 0930  6    easier penetration.
F07 0930  8       Extensive observations by physicians during vaginal
F07 0940  6    examinations have established the fact that a single
F07 0950  6    finger inserted along the anterior wall (the top line
F07 0960  4    of the vagina as the woman lies on her back) may cause
F07 0970  1    a great deal of distress in a virgin. But during the
F07 0970 12    same examination, two fingers may be inserted along
F07 0980  7    the posterior wall (the bottom of the vagina in the
F07 0990  7    same position) without any pain; and in fact without
F07 1000  3    any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at
F07 1000 12    all times.
F07 1010  2       These regional differences of sensitivity to pain
F07 1010  9    may be of crucial significance during the earliest
F07 1020  8    intercourse. The husband and wife should start with
F07 1030  6    this anatomical information clearly in mind. They may
F07 1040  4    then adjust their positions and movements to avoid
F07 1040 12    too much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall
F07 1050 10    of the vagina; at least until repeated intercourse
F07 1060  5    has dilated it and pain is no longer a possible threat
F07 1070  4    against the full pleasure of love-making.
F07 1080  1       In fact, the technical procedure in medical examinations
F07 1080  8    may be wisely adapted to his romantic purposes by the
F07 1090  8    husband during the honeymoon.
F07 1100  1       Locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a
F07 1100 10    man is doing the girl a favor if he is forceful and
F07 1110 10    ruthless during the first penetration. The false reasoning
F07 1120  4    is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain while a
F07 1130  3    swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the
F07 1130 13    girl pleased with his virility and grateful for his
F07 1140  8    decisiveness in settling the problem once and for all.
F07 1150  7       Such talk is seriously in error. Ruthlessness at
F07 1160  3    this time can be a very severe shock to the bride,
F07 1170  1    both physically and psychologically. The insistent,
F07 1170  7    forceful penetration may tear and inflame the vaginal
F07 1180  7    walls as well as do excessive damage to the hymen.
F07 1190  4       The pain and distress associated with the performance
F07 1200  3    may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital
F07 1210  1    relations and cause her, unconsciously, to make the
F07 1210  9    sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercising
F07 1220  7    her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead
F07 1230  4    of relaxing them to facilitate it.
F07 1230 10    ##
F07 1240  1    Serious attention must also be given to the husband's
F07 1240 10    problems in the honeymoon situation. The necessity
F07 1250  6    for keeping alert to his bride's hazards can act as
F07 1260  5    an interference with the man's spontaneous desire.
F07 1270  2    The emotional stimulation may be so great that he may
F07 1270 12    experience a premature climax. This is a very common
F07 1280  9    experience and should in no way discourage or dishearten
F07 1290  6    either husband or wife.
F07 1290 10       Or the frequent need to check and discipline himself
F07 1300  8    to the wisest pace of the consummation can put him
F07 1310  6    off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously
F07 1320  4    ready for penetration over a long period. The signals
F07 1330  1    to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily
F07 1330 10    not able to take advantage of them.
F07 1340  5       The best course is to recover his physical excitement
F07 1350  2    by a change of pace that makes him ardent again. This
F07 1360  1    may require imagination and reminding himself that
F07 1360  8    now he can be demanding and self-centered. He can take
F07 1370  7    security from the fact that the progress he has made
F07 1380  5    by his gentle approach will not be lost.
F07 1390  1       Now while he uses talk, caresses or requires caresses
F07 1390 10    from her, his bride will sympathetically understand
F07 1400  4    the situation and eagerly help him restore his physical
F07 1410  4    situation so they can have the consummation they both
F07 1420  2    so eagerly desire.
F07 1420  5       A final word. The accumulated information on this
F07 1430  3    point shows that first intercourse, even when it is
F07 1430 12    achieved with minimum pain or difficulty, is seldom
F07 1440  8    an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman. Too many
F07 1450  7    new things are happening for it to be a complete erotic
F07 1460  5    fulfillment.
F07 1460  6       Only under rare circumstances would a bride experience
F07 1470  5    an orgasm during her first intercourse. Both man and
F07 1480  3    wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax,
F07 1480 15    and even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure
F07 1490  9    are not a sign that the wife may be cold or frigid.
F07 1500  8       If the early approaches are wise, understanding
F07 1510  2    and patient, the satisfactions of marital fulfillment
F07 1520  1    will probably be discovered before the marriage is
F07 1520  9    much older.
F07 1530  1       WRITING in a large volume on the nude in painting
F07 1530 11    and sculptures, titled The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form,
F07 1540  9    Kenneth Clark declares: "**h The human body, as a nucleus,
F07 1550 10    is rich in associations. **h It is ourselves and arouses
F07 1560  7    memories of all the things we wish to do with ourselves".
F07 1565  7       Perhaps this is a clue to the amazing variety and
F07 1570  5    power of reactions, attitudes, and emotions precipitated
F07 1575  1    by the nude form.
F07 1575  5       The wide divergence of reactions is clearly illustrated
F07 1580  4    in the Kinsey studies in human sexuality. Differences
F07 1590  2    were related to social, economic, and educational backgrounds.
F07 1600  1    Whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were
F07 1600 10    more apt to avoid or be shocked by nudity, those educated
F07 1610 10    beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcomed and approved
F07 1620  6    nudity in sexual relations.
F07 1630  1       Such understanding helps to explain why one matron
F07 1630  9    celebrating thirty-five years of married life could
F07 1640  8    declare with some pride that her husband had "never
F07 1650  5    seen her entirely naked", while another woman, boasting
F07 1660  2    an equal number of years of married life, is proud
F07 1660 12    of having "shared the nudist way of life- the really
F07 1670  9    free, natural nude life- for most of that period".
F07 1680  6       Attempts at censorship always involve and reveal
F07 1690  4    such complex and multiple individual reactions. The
F07 1695  2    indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude human
F07 1700  2    form as "lewd and pornographic, a threat and danger"
F07 1710  7    to all the young, or good, or religious, or moral persons.
F07 1720  6       The equally ardent proponent of freedom from any
F07 1740  4    kind of censorship may find the nude human form the
F07 1750  1    "natural, honest, free expression of man's spirit and
F07 1750  9    the epitome of beauty and inspiration".
F07 1760  5       One is always a little surprised to bump into such
F07 1770  5    individual distinctions when it is unexpected. I still
F07 1780  2    recall the mild shock I experienced in reading material
F07 1780 11    of an enthusiastic advocate of the "clean, healthful,
F07 1790  6    free way of natural life in nudism", who seemed to
F07 1800  6    brave much misunderstanding and persecution in fine
F07 1810  3    spirit.
F08 0010  1       @ IN TRADITION and in poetry, the marriage bed is
F08 0010 11    a place of unity and harmony. The partners each bring
F08 0020  9    to it unselfish love, and each takes away an equal
F08 0030  7    share of pleasure and joy.
F08 0030 12       At its most ecstatic moments, husband and wife are
F08 0040  8    elevated far above worldly cares. Everything else is
F08 0050  5    closed away.
F08 0050  7       This is the ideal. But marriage experts say that
F08 0060  6    such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom
F08 0070  3    achieved. Instead one partner or the other dominates
F08 0070 11    the sexual relationship. In the past, it has been the
F08 0080 10    husband who has been dominant and the wife passive.
F08 0090  6    But today there are signs that these roles are being
F08 0100  4    reversed.
F08 0100  5       In a growing number of American homes, marriage
F08 0110  2    counselors report, the wife is taking a commanding
F08 0110 10    role in sexual relationships. It is she who decides
F08 0120  9    the time, the place, the surroundings, and the frequency
F08 0130  6    of the sexual act. It is she who says aye or nay to
F08 0140  6    the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics-
F08 0150  3    not the husband. The whole act is tailored to her pleasure,
F08 0160  1    and not to theirs.
F08 0160  5       Beyond a certain point, of course, no woman can
F08 0170  4    be dominant- nature has seen to that. But there is
F08 0170 14    little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss
F08 0180 10    of the marital bed.
F08 0190  1       Of course, there remain many "old-fashioned" marriages
F08 0190  9    in which the husband maintains his supremacy. Yet even
F08 0200  9    in these marriages, psychologists say, wives are asserting
F08 0210  6    themselves more strongly. The meekest, most submissive
F08 0220  4    wife of today is a tiger by her mother's or grandmother's
F08 0230  3    standards.
F08 0230  4       To many experts, this trend was inevitable. They
F08 0240  3    consider it simply a sign of our times. Our society
F08 0250  1    has "emancipated" the woman, giving her new independence
F08 0250  9    and new authority. It is only natural that she assert
F08 0260  9    herself in the sexual role.
F08 0270  2       "The sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum",
F08 0280  1    declares Dr& Mary Steichen Calderone, medical director
F08 0280  8    of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and
F08 0290  7    author of the recent book, Release From Sexual Tensions.
F08 0300  6    "It reflects what is going on in other areas of the
F08 0310  7    marriage and in society itself. A world in which wives
F08 0320  4    have taken a more active role is likely to produce
F08 0320 14    sexual relationships in which wives are more self-assertive,
F08 0330  9    too".
F08 0340  1       Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree
F08 0340  8    that domination of the sex relationship by one partner
F08 0350  8    or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous. It
F08 0360  5    can, in fact, wreck a marriage.
F08 0360 11       When a husband is sexually selfish and heedless
F08 0370  8    of his wife's desires, she is cheated of the fulfillment
F08 0380  6    and pleasure nature intended for her. And she begins
F08 0390  4    to regard him as savage, bestial and unworthy.
F08 0400  1       On the other hand, wifely supremacy demeans the
F08 0400  9    husband, saps his self-respect, and robs him of his
F08 0410  6    masculinity. He is a target of ridicule to his wife,
F08 0420  4    and often- since private affairs rarely remain private-
F08 0430  3    to the outside world as well.
F08 0430  9       "A marriage can survive almost any kind of stress
F08 0440  5    except an open and direct challenge to the husband's
F08 0450  1    maleness", declares Dr& Calderone. This opinion is
F08 0450  8    supported by one of the nation's leading psychiatrists,
F08 0460  8    Dr& Maurice E& Linden, director of the Mental Health
F08 0470  8    Division of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health.
F08 0480  5       "When the roles of husband and wife are reversed,
F08 0490  6    so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower",
F08 0500  3    Dr& Linden says, "the effects on their whole relationship,
F08 0510  2    sexual and otherwise, can be disastrous".
F08 0510  8    ##
F08 0520  1    IN ONE EXTREME case, cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist,
F08 0520 10    an office worker's wife refused to have sexual relations
F08 0530  8    with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries
F08 0540  7    she demanded. To win her favors, her husband first
F08 0550  3    took an additional job, then desperately began to embezzle
F08 0560  1    from his employer. Caught at last, he was sentenced
F08 0560 10    to prison. While he was in custody his wife divorced
F08 0570  8    him.
F08 0570  9       More typical is the case of a suburban Long Island
F08 0580  8    housewife described by a marriage counselor. This woman
F08 0590  4    repeatedly complained she was "too tired" for marital
F08 0600  3    relations. To please her, her husband assumed some
F08 0600 11    of the domestic chores. Finally, he was cooking, washing
F08 0610  8    dishes, bathing the children, and even ironing- and
F08 0620  6    still his wife refused to have relations as often as
F08 0630  4    he desired them.
F08 0630  7       One wife, described by a New York psychologist,
F08 0640  4    so dominated her husband that she actually placed their
F08 0650  2    sexual relationship on a schedule, writing it down
F08 0650 10    right between the weekly ~PTA meetings and the Thursday-night
F08 0660  9    neighborhood card parties. Another put sex on a dollars-and-cents
F08 0670 11    basis. After every money argument, she rebuffed her
F08 0680  7    husband's overtures until the matter was settled in
F08 0690  5    her favor.
F08 0690  7       Experts say the partners in marriages like these
F08 0700  4    can almost be typed.
F08 0700  8       The wife is likely to be young, sophisticated, smart
F08 0710  6    as a whip- often a girl who has sacrificed a promising
F08 0720  3    career for marriage. She knows the power of the sex
F08 0730  2    urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband.
F08 0730 12       The husband is usually a well-educated professional,
F08 0740  7    preoccupied with his job- often an organization man
F08 0750  7    whose motto for getting ahead is: "Don't rock the boat".
F08 0760  4       Sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly
F08 0770  2    dominant in marriage. Hemmed in on the job and unable
F08 0770 12    to assert himself, he uses the sex act so he can be
F08 0780 12    supreme in at least one area.
F08 0790  2       More often, though, he is so accustomed to submitting
F08 0800  1    to authority on the job without argument that he lives
F08 0800 11    by the same rule at home.
F08 0810  3       Some psychologists, in fact, suggest that career-bound
F08 0820  1    husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages
F08 0820 11    than their wives. The wife's attempt at control, these
F08 0830  8    psychologists contend, is sometimes merely a pathetic
F08 0840  6    effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention
F08 0850  4    to her as he does to his job.
F08 0850 12       Naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize
F08 0860  6    the sexual initiative. Unless her husband also desires
F08 0870  4    sex, the act cannot be consummated. Generally, however,
F08 0880  2    in such marriages as those cited, the husband is at
F08 0880 12    his wife's mercy.
F08 0890  2       "The pattern", says Dr& Morton Schillinger, psychologist
F08 0900  2    at New York's Lincoln Institute for Psychotherapy,
F08 0910  1    "is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly,
F08 0910 11    virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash
F08 0920  9    him the signal that tonight is the night".
F08 0930  4       No one seriously contends, of course, that the domineering
F08 0940  3    wife is, sexually speaking, a new character in our
F08 0940 12    world. After all, the henpecked husband with his shrewish
F08 0950  9    wife is a comic figure of long standing, in literature
F08 0960  7    and on the stage, as Dr& Schillinger points out. There
F08 0970  4    is no evidence that these Milquetoasts became suddenly
F08 0980  3    emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the
F08 0980 11    master bedroom.
F08 0990  2    ##
F08 0990  3    FURTHERMORE, Dr& Calderone says, a certain number of
F08 1000  3    docile, retiring men always have been around. They
F08 1000 11    aren't "frigid" and they aren't homosexual; they're
F08 1010  7    just restrained in all of life. They like to be dominated.
F08 1020 10    One such man once confided to Dr& Theodor Reik, New
F08 1030  7    York psychiatrist, that he preferred to have his wife
F08 1040  6    the sexual aggressor. Asked why, he replied primly:
F08 1050  2    "Because that's no activity for a gentleman".
F08 1060  1       But such cases were, in the past, unusual. Society
F08 1060 10    here and abroad has been built around the dominating
F08 1070  7    male- even the Bible appears to endorse the concept.
F08 1080  5       Family survival on our own Western frontier, for
F08 1090  2    example, could quite literally depend on a man's strength
F08 1100  1    and ability to bring home the bacon; and the dependent
F08 1100 11    wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything,
F08 1110  6    including the marriage bed.
F08 1120  1       This carried over into the more urbanized late 19th
F08 1120 10    and early 20th centuries, when the man ruled the roost
F08 1130  9    in the best bull-roaring Life With Father manner.
F08 1140  5       In those days, a wife had mighty few rights in the
F08 1150  5    domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere.
F08 1160  1    "Grandma wasn't expected to like it", Dr& Marion Hilliard,
F08 1170  1    the late Toronto gynecologist, once summed up the attitude
F08 1170 10    of the '90s. Wives of the period shamefacedly thought
F08 1180  8    of themselves as "used" by their husbands- and, history
F08 1190  7    indicates, they often quite literally were.
F08 1200  3       When was the turning point? When did women begin
F08 1210  2    to assert themselves sexually?
F08 1210  6    ##
F08 1210  7    SOME DATE IT from woman suffrage, others from when
F08 1220  6    women first began to challenge men in the marketplace,
F08 1230  4    still others from the era of the emancipated flapper
F08 1240  1    and bathtub gin. Virtually everyone agrees, however,
F08 1240  8    that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness
F08 1250  5    was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush
F08 1260  4    to the suburbs.
F08 1260  7       Left alone while her husband was miles away in the
F08 1270  6    city, the modern wife assumed more and more duties
F08 1280  1    normally reserved for the male. Circumstances gave
F08 1280  8    her almost undisputed sway over child-rearing, money-handling
F08 1290  7    and home maintenance. She found she could cope with
F08 1300  7    all kinds of problems for which she was once considered
F08 1310  3    too helpless. She liked this taste of authority and
F08 1320  1    independence, and, with darkness, was not likely to
F08 1320  9    give it up.
F08 1330  1       "Very few wives", says Dr& Calderone, "who balance
F08 1330  9    the checkbook, fix the car, choose where the family
F08 1340  8    will live and deal with the tradesmen, are suddenly
F08 1350  5    going to become submissive where sex is concerned.
F08 1360  1    A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate
F08 1360 10    the sexual relationship as well".
F08 1370  5       And an additional factor was helping to make women
F08 1380  5    more sexually self-assertive- the comparatively recent
F08 1390  2    discovery of the true depths of female desire and response.
F08 1400  1    Marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began
F08 1400  8    to stress the importance of the female climax. They
F08 1410  7    began to describe in detail the woman's capacity for
F08 1420  4    response.
F08 1420  5       In fact, the noted psychologist and sex researcher,
F08 1430  4    Dr& Albert Ellis, has declared flatly that women are
F08 1440  3    "sexually superior" to men. According to Dr& Ellis,
F08 1450  1    the average 20-year-old American woman is capable of
F08 1450 11    far greater sexual arousal than her partner. Not surprisingly,
F08 1460  7    Dr& Ellis says, some recently enlightened wives are
F08 1470  6    out to claim these capabilities.
F08 1480  1       Yet, paradoxically, according to Dr& Maurice Linden,
F08 1480  8    many wives despise their husbands for not standing
F08 1490  8    up to them. An aggressive woman wants a man to demand,
F08 1500  7    not knuckle under. "When the husband becomes passive
F08 1510  3    in the face of his wife's aggressiveness", Dr& Linden
F08 1520  2    says, "the wife, in turn, finds him inadequate. Often
F08 1520 11    she fails to gain sexual satisfaction".
F08 1530  6       One such wife, Dr& Linden says, became disgusted
F08 1540  5    with her weak husband and flurried through a series
F08 1550  3    of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger
F08 1560  1    man. But her personality was such that each affair
F08 1560 10    lasted only until that lover, too, had been conquered
F08 1570  7    and reduced to passivity. Then the wife bed-hopped
F08 1580  4    to the next on the list.
F08 1580 10       In some cases, however, domination of the sex act
F08 1590  6    by one partner can be temporary, triggered by a passing
F08 1600  4    but urgent emotional need. Thus a man who is butting
F08 1610  1    a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive
F08 1610 11    in bed- the one place he can still be champion. If
F08 1620 10    his on-the-job problems work out, he may return to
F08 1630  6    his old pattern. Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness
F08 1640  1    will sweep over a man- or his wife- because he or she
F08 1640 13    feels age creeping up.
F08 1650  4       On the other hand, a husband who always has been
F08 1660  2    vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive-
F08 1660  9    asking, psychologists say, for reassurance that his
F08 1670  7    wife still finds him desirable. Or a wife may make
F08 1680  6    sudden demands that she be courted, flattered or coaxed,
F08 1690  3    simply because she needs her ego lifted.
F08 1690 10       In any case, Dr& Calderone remarks, such problems
F08 1700  6    are a couple's own affair, and can't always be measured
F08 1710  6    by a general yardstick. "As long as the couple is in
F08 1720  6    agreement in their approach to sex, it makes little
F08 1730  1    difference if one or the other dominates", Dr& Calderone
F08 1730 10    declares. "The important point is that both be satisfied
F08 1740  9    with the adjustment".
F08 1750  1       Other experts say, however, that if sexual domination
F08 1760  1    by one or the other partner exists for longer than
F08 1760 11    a brief period, it is likely to shake the marriage.
F08 1770  8    And just as domination today often begins with the
F08 1780  4    wife, so the cure generally must lie with the husband.
F08 1790  1       "To get a marriage back where it belongs", comments
F08 1790 10    Dr& Schillinger of the Lincoln Institute, "the husband
F08 1800  8    must take some very basic steps. He must begin, paradoxically,
F08 1810  9    by becoming more selfish. He must become more expressive
F08 1820  7    of his own desires, more demanding and less 'understanding'".
F08 1830  4       Too many husbands, Dr& Schillinger continues, worry
F08 1840  4    about "how well they're doing", and fear that their
F08 1850  5    success depends on some trick or technique of sexual
F08 1860  1    play.
F09 0010  1    ##
F09 0010  2    SHE GAVE HERSELF a title **h Lady Diana Harrington.
F09 0010 11       The New York D&A& gave her another **h the Golden
F09 0020 11    Girl of cafe society.
F09 0030  4       Houston police gave her a third, less flamboyant,
F09 0040  1    title **h prostitute.
F09 0040  4       And Houston police have the final say in the matter
F09 0050  5    since she died there on September 20, 1960, "Diane
F09 0060  1    Harris Graham, 30, D&O&A& circumstances- unusual".
F09 0070  1       Early in her life she had discovered that where
F09 0070 10    there were men, there was money, and with the two came
F09 0080  9    luxury and liquor. She was still in the play for pay
F09 0090  6    business when she died, a top trollop who had given
F09 0100  2    the world's oldest profession one of its rare flashes
F09 0100 11    of glamour.
F09 0110  1       She never hid the fact that she liked to play. Her
F09 0110 12    neighbors in the expensive Houston apartment building
F09 0120  7    told reporters that the ash-blonde beauty had talked
F09 0130  7    at times about her past as "the Golden Girl of the
F09 0150  4    Mickey Jelke trial".
F09 0150  7       It was the trial of oleomargarine heir Minot (Mickey)
F09 0160  5    Jelke for compulsory prostitution in New York that
F09 0170  5    put the spotlight on the international play-girl. (Jelke
F09 0180  2    later served 21 months when he was found guilty of
F09 0180 12    masterminding a ring of high-priced call girls.)
F09 0190  8       Diane was needed as a material witness in the case
F09 0200  5    and New York police searched three continents before
F09 0210  2    they found her in their own back yard- in a swank hotel,
F09 0220  1    of course. She had been moving in cafe society as Lady
F09 0220 12    Diana Harrington, a name that made some of the gossip
F09 0230  9    columns.
F09 0230 10       It was when she was seized as a material witness
F09 0240  8    that she got the designation she liked best.
F09 0250  4       Clad in mink and diamonds, she listened to Assistant
F09 0260  1    District Attorney Anthony Liebler describe her to the
F09 0260  9    arraigning judge:
F09 0270  2       "This girl is the Golden Girl of cafe society.
F09 0280  1       "In 1951 she was a prostitute in New York County.
F09 0280 11    In the spring and early summer of that year she met
F09 0290 11    a wealthy foreign tycoon who took her to France, where
F09 0300  8    she later met a very wealthy man and toured all Europe
F09 0310  5    with him.
F09 0310  7       "At Deauville she met an Egyptian by the name of
F09 0320  6    Pulley Bey. He was the official procurer for King Farouk,
F09 0330  3    now in exile. She was in Egypt during the revolution
F09 0340  1    and had passport difficulty. She lied in order to get
F09 0340 11    it.
F09 0350  1       "We have checked her in different parts of Europe
F09 0350  9    and Egypt and finally back into this country **h She
F09 0360  7    has been acting as a prostitute.
F09 0370  1       "Our information is that she gave the proceeds of
F09 0370 10    her acts to Jelke".
F09 0380  3       Diane sobbingly denied this to the court.
F09 0390  1       "That's a lie. I never gave that boy a cent. I am
F09 0390 12    not a prostitute, and I had only one very wealthy boy
F09 0400  9    friend", she said.
F09 0410  1       During the course of the trial, Jelke backed up
F09 0410  9    part of that statement.
F09 0420  1       "Diane is the type of girl", Jelke said, "who wouldn't
F09 0430  1    get loving- even on her wedding night- unless you piled
F09 0430 11    up all your money in the middle of the floor".
F09 0440 10       But she seemed to have underestimated the number
F09 0450  5    of her "boy friends".
F09 0450  9       She came to New York from Detroit as a teenager,
F09 0460 10    but with a "sponsor" instead of a chaperone. As she
F09 0470  7    told it, "He's a rich boy friend, an old guy about
F09 0480  5    60". She was Mary Lou Brew then, wide-eyed, but not
F09 0490  3    naive. She had talked her "boy friend" into sending
F09 0490 12    her to New York to take a screen test.
F09 0510  1       The screen test was never made- but Diane was. She
F09 0510 11    quickly moved into cafe society, possibly easing her
F09 0520  8    conscience by talking constantly of her desire to be
F09 0530  7    in show business.
F09 0530 10       She seemed so anxious to go on the stage that some
F09 0540 10    of her friends in the cocktail circuit set up a practical
F09 0550  6    joke.
F09 0550  7       An ex-fighter was introduced to her in a bar as
F09 0560  7    "Mr& Warfield, the famous producer". The phony producer
F09 0570  3    asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows.
F09 0580  1       "I'd love to audition for you", she gushed.
F09 0580  9       The audition was held a few minutes later in somebody's
F09 0590 10    apartment. She thought she had great possibilities
F09 0600  6    in the ballet and wanted to show the eminent producer
F09 0610  4    how well she could dance.
F09 0610  9       After a few minutes he said, "I can't use you if
F09 0620  8    you dance like that. I'd like to see you dance nude".
F09 0630  6       She hastily complied. Diane loved to dance in the
F09 0640  5    nude, something she was to demonstrate time and again.
F09 0650  1       She developed another quaint habit. Even among the
F09 0650  9    fast set in which she was moving, her method for keeping
F09 0660 10    an escort from departing too early was unique.
F09 0670  5       When the date would try to bid her good-night at
F09 0680  4    the door, she would tell him, "If you go home now,
F09 0680 15    I'll scream". More often than not he would bow to the
F09 0690 11    inevitable.
F09 0700  1       One who needed no such threats was a French financier.
F09 0700 11    One of the blonde's yearnings that he satisfied was
F09 0710  8    for travel. She wanted to go around the world, but
F09 0720  7    she settled for a French holiday.
F09 0730  1       In an anonymous interview with a French newspaper
F09 0730  9    the financier told of spending several months with
F09 0740  6    her. "Then she went to Deauville where she met a member
F09 0750  6    of a powerful Greek syndicate of gamblers".
F09 0760  1       The Greek evidently fell for her, "Monsieur ~X"
F09 0760  9    recounted, and to clinch what he thought was an affair
F09 0770 10    in the making he gave her 100,000 francs (about $300)
F09 0780  7    and led her to the roulette tables.
F09 0790  1       She could do no wrong at the tables that time. And
F09 0790 12    in short order the croupier had pushed several million
F09 0800  8    francs her way. Smarter than most gamblers, she slipped
F09 0810  6    away from the casino, packed her bag and took the night
F09 0820  5    train to Paris. No one ever learned what happened to
F09 0830  2    the Greek.
F09 0830  4       The luxury of Paris' most fashionable hotel, the
F09 0840  2    George /5,, bored the beautifully-built blonde, so
F09 0840 10    she high-tailed it to Rome.
F09 0850  4       She teamed up with another beauty, whose name has
F09 0860  3    been lost to history, and commenced with some fiddling
F09 0860 12    that would have made Nero envious.
F09 0870  6       To climax her Roman revels, she was thrown out of
F09 0880  5    the swanky Hotel Excelsior after she had run naked
F09 0890  1    through its marble halls screaming for help.
F09 0890  8       It was a rugged finish for what must have been a
F09 0900  8    very interesting night.
F09 0900 11       Discreet Italian police described it in a manner
F09 0910  8    typically continental.
F09 0920  1       "There had been a threesome at the party in the
F09 0920 11    suite's bedroom: Miss Harrington (this was Diane's
F09 0930  6    choice for a Roman name), another woman who has figured
F09 0940  6    in other very interesting events and one of your well-known
F09 0950  6    American actors.
F09 0950  8       "The actor had had much to drink and apparently
F09 0960  6    became very violent. The hotel staff, as well as residents
F09 0970  5    of the Excelsior, told us they saw that both ladies
F09 0980  1    were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing
F09 0980 10    down the hall.
F09 0990  1       "They were wearing nothing but their scratches.
F09 0990  8    They were asked to leave the hotel. No charges were
F09 1000  9    filed".
F09 1000 10       The girls, after dressing, were indignant.
F09 1010  5       "You can't do this to us", Diane screamed. "We are
F09 1020  6    Americans".
F09 1020  7       In the morning she found rooms directly across from
F09 1030  7    the Excelsior at the equally luxurious Hotel Ambassador.
F09 1040  4       With the Ambassador as headquarters, she continued
F09 1050  3    to promote good will abroad. Of course, her benevolence
F09 1060  1    was limited to those who could afford it, but then
F09 1060 11    there is a limit to what one person can do.
F09 1070  8       By this time Diane was a beguiling lass of 19 and
F09 1080  5    still seeking her place in the world. She thought royal
F09 1090  2    status might come her way when, while she was still
F09 1090 12    in Rome, she met Pulley Bey, a personal procurer to
F09 1100  9    King Farouk of Egypt.
F09 1110  1       A close friend of hers in the Roman days described
F09 1110 11    it this way:
F09 1120  2       "It was a strange relationship. Pulley Bey spoke
F09 1120 10    no English. Diane spoke no Italian or French. She had
F09 1130 10    a hard time making him understand that it was Farouk
F09 1140  8    she wished to meet.
F09 1150  1       "Pulley Bey insisted that she bestow her favors
F09 1150  8    on him", the friend continued. It seemed as though
F09 1160  6    she were always auditioning.
F09 1170  1       No believer in the traditional devotion of royal
F09 1170  8    servitors, the plump Pulley broke the language barrier
F09 1180  6    and lured her to Cairo where she waited for nine months,
F09 1190  5    vainly hoping to see Farouk.
F09 1190 10       Pulley had set her up at the Semiramis Hotel, but
F09 1200 10    she grew impatient waiting for a royal reception and
F09 1210  6    moved to a luxurious apartment to which the royal pimp
F09 1220  3    had no key.
F09 1220  6       She picked her own Middle-Eastern friends from the
F09 1230  3    flock of ardent Egyptians that buzzed around her. Tewfik
F09 1240  1    Badrawi, Mohammed Gaafer and numerous other wealthy
F09 1240  8    members of Cairo society enjoyed her company.
F09 1250  6       "So extensive became her circle of admirers", Egyptian
F09 1260  5    police said, "that her escapades caused distrust".
F09 1270  3       The roof was about ready to fall in on Diane's little
F09 1280  2    world, but it took nothing less than the Egyptian revolution
F09 1290  1    to bring it down. When Farouk was overthrown, police
F09 1290 10    picked up his personal pimp, Pulley Bey. They also
F09 1300  8    called upon Diane with a request for a look at her
F09 1310  8    passport.
F09 1310  9       The cagey Pulley Bey, who spoke no English, had
F09 1320  6    taken the passport so that Diane couldn't leave the
F09 1330  3    country without his approval. Officials provided a
F09 1330 10    temporary passport, good only for return to the United
F09 1340  9    States.
F09 1340 10       And return to the United States she did, into waiting
F09 1350 10    arms- the unromantic ones of the New York District
F09 1360  7    Attorney's office.
F09 1360  9       Held as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution
F09 1370  9    trial of Mickey Jelke, the comely courtesan was unable
F09 1380  7    to raise bail and was committed to the Women's House
F09 1390  5    of Detention, a terribly overcrowded prison.
F09 1400  1       It is a tribute to her talents that she was able
F09 1400 12    to talk the District Attorney into having her removed
F09 1410  8    from the prison to a hotel room, with her meals taken
F09 1420  7    at Vesuvio's, an excellent Italian restaurant.
F09 1430  2       Newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated
F09 1440  1    that she was co-operating with the District Attorney.
F09 1440 10       With the end of the trial Diane disappeared from
F09 1450  9    New York **h it was no longer fashionable to be seen
F09 1460  7    with fabulous "Lady Harrington".
F09 1470  1       Several years ago she married a Houston business
F09 1470  9    man, Robert Graham. She later divorced Graham, who
F09 1480  7    is believed to have moved to Bolivia.
F09 1490  3       Houston police got to know Diane two years ago when
F09 1500  2    the vice squad picked her up for questioning about
F09 1500 11    a call girl ring. Last May, they said, she admitted
F09 1510  7    being a prostitute.
F09 1510 10       The next time the police saw her she was dead.
F09 1520 10       It was September 20, 1960, in a lavishly decorated
F09 1530  7    apartment littered with liquor bottles. She had had
F09 1540  4    a party with a regular visitor, Dr& William W& McClellan.
F09 1550  2       McClellan, who had once lost his medical license
F09 1560  1    temporarily on a charge of drug addiction, was with
F09 1560 10    her when she died. He had been in the apartment two
F09 1570  8    days and was hazy about what had happened during that
F09 1580  4    time. When he realized she was dead, he called two
F09 1590  2    lawyers and then the police.
F09 1590  7       When the police arrived, they found McClellan and
F09 1600  4    the two lawyers sitting and staring silently.
F09 1610  1       The blonde's nude body was in bed, a green sheet
F09 1610 11    and a pink blanket covered her. Pictures of her in

F10 0010  1    FRANKLIN D& Lee proved a man of prompt action when
F10 0010 11    Mrs& Claire Shaefer, accompanied by a friend, visited
F10 0020  8    him in Bakersfield, California, several months ago
F10 0030  5    as a prospective patient. "Doctor" Lee asked her to
F10 0040  5    lie down on a bed and remove her shoes. Then, by squeezing
F10 0050  3    her foot three times, he came up- presto- with a different
F10 0060  2    diagnosis with each squeeze. She had- he informed her-
F10 0070  1    kidney trouble, liver trouble, and a severe female
F10 0070  9    disorder. (He explained that he could diagnose these
F10 0080  6    ailments from squeezing her foot because all of the
F10 0090  4    nervous system was connected to it.) He knew just the
F10 0100  1    thing for her- a treatment from his "cosmic light ozone
F10 0100 11    generator" machine.
F10 0110  2       As he applied the applicator extending from the
F10 0120  1    machine- which consisted of seven differently colored
F10 0120  7    neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base- to the
F10 0130  7    supposedly diseased portions of Mrs& Shaefer's body,
F10 0140  5    Lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo.
F10 0150  3    Yes, the ozone from his machine would cure practically
F10 0160  1    everything, he assured her. Did she know, he asked,
F10 0160 10    why the colors of the tubes were important to people's
F10 0170  9    health? The human body- he pointed out, for example-
F10 0180  6    required 33 units of blue light. For that reason, he
F10 0190  5    informed her, the Lord made the sky blue. Continuing
F10 0200  1    glibly in this vein, he paused to comfort her:
F10 0200 10       "Don't you worry. This machine will cure your cancer-ridden
F10 0210 10    body".
F10 0220  1       "Cancer"! Mrs& Shaefer practically shrieked. "You
F10 0230  1    didn't tell me I had cancer".
F10 0230  7       "You have it, all right. But as long as you can
F10 0240  7    have treatment from my machine you have nothing to
F10 0250  2    worry about. Why, I once used this machine to cure
F10 0250 12    a woman with 97 pounds of cancer in her body".
F10 0260  8       He urged her to buy one of his machines- for $300.
F10 0270  6    When she said that she didn't have the money, he said
F10 0280  4    that she could come in for treatment with his office
F10 0290  1    model until she was ready to buy one. He then sold
F10 0290 12    her minerals to cure her kidney ailment, a can of sage
F10 0300  8    "to make her look like a girl again", and an application
F10 0310  4    of plain mud to take her wrinkles away.
F10 0320  1       Lee renewed his pressure on Mrs& Shaefer to buy
F10 0320 10    his machine when she visited him the next day. After
F10 0330  9    another treatment with the machine, he told her that
F10 0340  5    "her entire body was shot through with tumors and cysts".
F10 0350  3    He then sold her some capsules that he asserted would
F10 0360  1    take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect
F10 0360 12    the money for buying his machine.
F10 0370  5       When she submitted to his treatment with the capsules,
F10 0380  3    Mrs& Shaefer felt intense pain. Leaving Lee's office,
F10 0390  2    Mrs& Shaefer hurried over to her family physician,
F10 0390 10    who treated her for burned tissue. For several days,
F10 0400  8    she was ill as a result of Lee's treatment.
F10 0410  4       Mrs& Shaefer never got around to joining the thousand
F10 0420  4    or so people who paid Lee some $30,000 for his ozone
F10 0430  1    machines. For Mrs& Shaefer- who had been given a clean
F10 0430 11    bill of health by her own physician at the time she
F10 0440 11    visited Lee- and her friend were agents for the California
F10 0450  7    Pure Food and Drug Inspection Bureau. And she felt
F10 0460  5    amply rewarded for her suffering when the evidence
F10 0470  2    of Lee's quack shenanigans, gathered by the tape recorder
F10 0490  1    under her friend's clothing, proved adequate in court
F10 0490  9    for convicting Franklin D& Lee. The charge: violation
F10 0500  7    of the California Medical Practices Act by practicing
F10 0510  5    medicine without a license and selling misbranded drugs.
F10 0520  3    The sentence: 360 days' confinement in the county jail.
F10 0530  3       An isolated case of quackery? By no means. Rather,
F10 0540  1    it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony
F10 0540 12    therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the miseries
F10 0550  8    of hundreds of thousands of Americans by robbing them
F10 0560  6    of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate,
F10 0570  4    ethical medical treatment of serious diseases. The
F10 0580  2    machine quack makes his Rube Goldberg devices out of
F10 0580 11    odds and ends of metals, wires, and radio parts.
F10 0590  8       With these gadgets- impressive to the gullible because
F10 0600  6    of their flashing light bulbs, ticks, and buzzes- he
F10 0610  4    then carries out a vicious medical con game, capitalizing
F10 0620  1    on people's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders
F10 0620 10    of our scientific age. He milks the latest scientific
F10 0630  9    advances, translating them into his own special Buck
F10 0640  7    Rogers vocabulary to huckster his fake machines as
F10 0650  4    a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual
F10 0660  1    impotence and cancer.
F10 0660  4       The gadget faker operates or sells his phony machines
F10 0670  3    for $5 to $10,000- anything the traffic will bear.
F10 0680  6    He may call himself a naprapath, a physiotherapist,
F10 0690  8    an electrotherapist, a naturopath, a sanipractor, a
F10 0700  6    medical cultist, a masseur, a "doctor"- or what have
F10 0710  6    you. Not only do these quacks assume impressive titles,
F10 0720  2    but represent themselves as being associated with various
F10 0720 10    scientific or impressive foundations- foundations which
F10 0740  3    often have little more than a letterhead existence.
F10 0750  6       The medical device pirate of today, of course, is
F10 0760  6    a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor
F10 0770  1    of yesteryear- the gallus-snapping hawker of snake
F10 0770  9    oil and other patent medicines. His plunder is therefore
F10 0780  8    far higher- running into hundreds of millions.
F10 0790  5       According to the Food and Drug Administration (~FDA),
F10 0800  3    "Doctor" Ghadiali, Dr& Albert Abrams and his clique,
F10 0810  5    and Dr& Wilhelm Reich- to name three notorious device
F10 0820  2    quacks- succeeded, respectively, in distributing 10,000,
F10 0830  1    5000, and 2000 fake health machines.
F10 0830  7       Authorities believe that many of the Doctor Frauds
F10 0840  7    using these false health gadgets are still in business.
F10 0850  4    Look at the sums paid by two device quack victims in
F10 0860  2    Cleveland. Sarah Gross, a dress shop proprietor, paid
F10 0860 10    $1020 to a masseur, and Mr& A&, a laborer, paid $4200
F10 0870 10    to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health
F10 0880  6    machines- the "radioclast" and the "diagnometer". Multiply
F10 0890  4    these figures by the millions of people known to be
F10 0900  4    conned by medical pirates annually. You will come up
F10 0910  1    with a frightening total.
F10 0910  5       That's why the ~FDA, the American Medical Association
F10 0920  3    (~AMA), and the National Better Business Bureau (~BBB)
F10 0930  3    have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be
F10 0940  3    a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid
F10 0940 13    to medical charlatans annually.
F10 0950  3       The Postmaster General recently reported that mail
F10 0960  3    order frauds- among which fake therapeutic devices
F10 0970  1    figure prominently- are at the highest level in history.
F10 0970 10    Similarly, the American Cancer Society (~ACS), the
F10 0980  7    Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation, and the ~BBB have
F10 0990  6    each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new
F10 1000  6    high. For example, the ~BBB has reported it was receiving
F10 1010  4    four times as many inquiries about quack devices and
F10 1020  1    10 times as many complaints compared with two years
F10 1020 10    ago.
F10 1020 11       Authorities hesitate to quote exact figures, however,
F10 1030  7    believing that any sum they come up with is only a
F10 1040  9    surface manifestation- turned up by their inevitably
F10 1050  3    limited policing- of the real loot of the medical racketeer.
F10 1060  2    In this sense, authorities believe that all estimates
F10 1060 10    of phony device quackery are conservative.
F10 1070  5       The economic toll that the device quack extracts
F10 1080  5    is important, of course. But it is our health- more
F10 1090  4    precious than all the money in the world- that these
F10 1090 14    modern witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets
F10 1100  8    are gambling away. By preying on the sick, by playing
F10 1110  8    callously on the hopes of the desperate, by causing
F10 1120  3    the sufferer to delay proper medical care, these medical
F10 1130  1    ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity.
F10 1130 10       Typically, Sarah Gross and Mr& ~A both lost more
F10 1140  9    than their money as the result of their experiences
F10 1150  7    with their Cleveland quacks. Sarah Gross found that
F10 1160  4    the treatments given her for a nervous ailment by the
F10 1170  3    masseur were not helping her. As a result, she consulted
F10 1170 13    medical authorities and learned that the devices her
F10 1180  8    quack "doctor" was using were phony. She suffered a
F10 1190  7    nervous breakdown and had to be institutionalized.
F10 1200  1       Mr& A&, her fellow townsman, also experienced a
F10 1210  2    nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that
F10 1210 11    he had been bilked of his life savings by the limited
F10 1220  9    practitioner who had been treating his wife- a woman
F10 1230  6    suffering from an incurable disease, multiple sclerosis-
F10 1240  1    and himself. Mr& ~A has recovered, but he is, justifiably,
F10 1250  2    a bitter man. "That's a lot of hard-earned money to
F10 1260  1    lose", he says today. "Neither me nor my wife were
F10 1260 11    helped by that chiropractor's treatments".
F10 1270  3       And there was the case of Tom Hepker, a machinist,
F10 1280  4    who was referred by a friend to a health machine quack
F10 1290  2    who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine
F10 1290 11    for what Doctor Fraud said was a system full of arsenic
F10 1300 10    and strychnine. After his pains got worse, Tom decided
F10 1310  7    to see a real doctor, from whom he learned he was suffering
F10 1320  5    from cancer of the lung. Yes, Tom caught it in time
F10 1330  4    to stay alive. But he's a welfare case now- a human
F10 1330 15    wreck- thanks to this modern witch doctor.
F10 1340  9       But the machine quack can cause far more than just
F10 1350  7    suffering. In such diseases as cancer, tuberculosis,
F10 1360  2    and heart disease, early diagnosis and treatment are
F10 1360 10    so vital that the waste of time by the patient with
F10 1370 11    Doctor Fraud's cure-all gadget can prove fatal. Moreover,
F10 1380  8    the diabetic patient who relies on cure by the quack
F10 1390  6    device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake can
F10 1400  2    be committing suicide. For instance:
F10 1400  7       In Chicago, some time ago, Mr& H&, age 27, a diabetic
F10 1410 10    since he was six, stopped using insulin because he
F10 1420  4    had bought a "magic spike"- a glass tube about the
F10 1430  3    size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth
F10 1430 12    a small fraction of a cent- sold by the Vrilium Company
F10 1440 10    of Chicago for $306 as a cure-all. "Hang this around
F10 1450  8    your neck or attach it to other parts of your anatomy,
F10 1460  5    and its rays will cure any disease you have", said
F10 1470  2    the company. Mr& H& is dead today because he followed
F10 1470 12    this advice.
F10 1480  2       Doris Hull, suffering from tuberculosis, was taken
F10 1490  1    by her husband to see Otis G& Carroll, a sanipractor-
F10 1490 11    a licensed drugless healer- in Spokane. Carroll diagnosed
F10 1500  7    Mrs& Hull by taking a drop of blood from her ear and
F10 1510 10    putting it on his "radionic" machine and twirling some
F10 1520  5    knobs (fee $50).
F10 1520  8       His prescription: hot and cold compresses to increase
F10 1530  7    her absorption of water. Although she weighed only
F10 1540  4    108 pounds when she visited him, Carroll permitted
F10 1550  1    her to go on a 10-day fast in which she took nothing
F10 1550 14    but water. Inevitably, Mrs& Hull died of starvation
F10 1560  7    and tuberculosis, weighing 60 pounds. Moreover, her
F10 1570  5    husband and child contracted T&B& from her. (Small
F10 1580  4    wonder a Spokane jury awarded the husband $35,823 for
F10 1590  2    his wife's death.)
F10 1590  5       In California, a few years ago, a ghoul by the name
F10 1600  4    of H& F& Bell sold electric blankets as a cure for
F10 1610  2    cancer. He did this by the charming practice of buying
F10 1610 12    up used electric blankets for $5 to $10 from survivors
F10 1620  8    of patients who had died, reconditioning them, and
F10 1630  4    selling them at $185 each. When authorities convicted
F10 1640  2    him of practicing medicine without a license (he got
F10 1640 11    off with a suspended sentence of three years because
F10 1650  8    of his advanced age of 77), one of his victims was
F10 1660  7    not around to testify: He was dead of cancer.
F10 1670  2       By no means are these isolated cases. "Unfortunately",
F10 1680  1    says Chief Postal Inspector David H& Stephens, who
F10 1680  9    has prosecuted many device quacks, "the ghouls who
F10 1690  7    trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often cannot
F10 1700  6    be successfully prosecuted because the patients who
F10 1710  3    are the chief witnesses die before the case is called
F10 1710 13    up in court".
F10 1720  3    ##
F10 1720  4    DEATH! Have no doubt about it. That's where device
F10 1730  3    quackery can lead. The evidence shows that fake therapeutic
F10 1740  1    machines, substituted for valid medical cures, have
F10 1740  8    hastened the deaths of thousands.
F10 1750  4       Who are the victims of the device quacks? Authorities
F10 1760  2    say that oldsters are a prime target. Says Wallace
F10 1770  1    F& Jannsen, director of the ~FDA's Division of Public
F10 1770 10    Information: "Quacks are apt to direct their appeal
F10 1780  8    directly to older people, or to sufferers from chronic
F10 1790  7    ailments such as arthritis, rheumatism, diabetes, and
F10 1800  3    cancer. People who have not been able to get relief
F10 1810  2    from regular medical doctors are especially apt to
F10 1810 10    be taken in by quacks". The victims of the quacks are
F10 1820  9    frequently poor people, like Mr& A&, who scrape up
F10 1830  6    their life savings to offer as a sacrifice to Doctor
F10 1840  3    Fraud's avarice. They are often ignorant as well as
F10 1850  1    underprivileged.
F11 0010  1       TEN-YEAR-OLD Richard Stewart had been irritable
F11 0010  9    and quarrelsome for almost a year. His grades had gone
F11 0020  9    steadily downhill, and he had stopped bringing friends
F11 0040  2    and classmates home from school.
F11 0050  1       Mr& and Mrs& Stewart were puzzled and concerned.
F11 0050  9    Then one day Dick's classmate Jimmy, from next door,
F11 0060  7    let the cat out of the bag. The youngsters in the boys'
F11 0070  7    class had nicknamed Dick "Bugs Bunny" because his teeth
F11 0080  5    protruded.
F11 0080  6       When Richard's parents told him they wanted to take
F11 0090  7    him to an orthodontist- a dentist who specializes in
F11 0100  3    realigning teeth and jaws- their young son was interested.
F11 0110  1    During the year that followed, Dick co-operated whole-heartedly
F11 0120  1    with the dentist and was delighted with the final result
F11 0120 11    achieved- an upper row of strong straight teeth that
F11 0130 11    completely changed his facial appearance.
F11 0140  3       Richard Stewart is no special case. "The majority
F11 0150  2    of children in the United States could benefit by some
F11 0150 12    form of orthodontic treatment", says Dr& Allan G& Brodie,
F11 0160  9    professor and head of the department of orthodontics
F11 0170  8    at the University of Illinois and a nationally recognized
F11 0180  6    authority in his field.
F11 0190  1       What do parents need to know about those "years
F11 0190 10    of the braces" in order not to waste a child's time
F11 0200  8    and their money? How can they tell whether a child
F11 0210  5    needs orthodontic treatment? Why and when should
F11 0220  1    tooth-straightening
F11 0220  3    be undertaken? What is it likely to cost?
F11 0230  1    #TOOTH FIT EXPLAINED#
F11 0230  4    OCCLUSION is the dentist's expression for the way teeth
F11 0240  5    fit together when the jaws are closed. Malocclusion,
F11 0250  1    or a bad fit, is what parents need to look out for.
F11 0250 13    One main type of malocclusion is characterized by a
F11 0260  7    receding chin and protruding upper front teeth. A chin
F11 0270  5    too prominent in relation to the rest of the face,
F11 0280  2    a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth, an overdeveloped
F11 0280 12    lower jawbone, and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate
F11 0290  8    the opposite type of malocclusion.
F11 0300  3       These two basic malformations have, of course, many
F11 0310  2    variations. A child probably requires some form of
F11 0310 10    treatment if he has any of the following conditions:
F11 0320  9    _@_

F11 0360  9       The eyeteeth (third from the middle on top, counting
F11 0370  6    each front tooth as the first) beginning to protrude

F11 0380  6       Second teeth that have come in before the first
F11 0390  3    ones have fallen out, making a double row.
F11 0390 11       Contrary to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago,
F11 0400 10    when all malocclusion was blamed on some unfortunate
F11 0410  5    habit, recent studies show that most tooth irregularity
F11 0420  2    has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition.
F11 0430  1    However, this does not mean that a child's teeth or
F11 0430 11    jaws must necessarily resemble those of someone in
F11 0440  7    his family.
F11 0440  9       Tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb-
F11 0450  9    or finger-sucking, tongue-thrusting, or lip-sucking-
F11 0460  4    but it's important to remember that there's a difference
F11 0470  4    between normal and excessive sucking habits. It's perfectly
F11 0480  4    normal for babies to suck their thumbs, and no mother
F11 0490  3    need worry if a child continues this habit until he
F11 0490 13    is two or three years old. Occasional sucking up to
F11 0500  9    the fifth year may not affect a youngster's teeth;
F11 0510  4    but after that, if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent,
F11 0520  3    it will have an effect.
F11 0520  8       Malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost
F11 0530  7    too soon or retained too long. If a child loses a molar
F11 0540  4    at the age of two, the adjoining teeth may shift toward
F11 0550  1    the empty space, thus narrowing the place intended
F11 0550  9    for the permanent ones and producing a jumble. If baby
F11 0560  8    teeth are retained too long, the incoming second teeth
F11 0570  4    may be prevented from emerging at the normal time or
F11 0580  3    may have to erupt in the wrong place.
F11 0580 11    #CORRECTION CAN SAVE TEETH#
F11 0590  1    EVERY orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed
F11 0590  8    by their malformed teeth. Some such youngsters rarely
F11 0600  8    smile, or they try to speak with the mouth closed.
F11 0610  7    In certain cases, as in Dick Stewart's, a child's personality
F11 0620  4    is affected. Yet from the dentist's point of view,
F11 0630  4    bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical
F11 0630 12    reasons.
F11 0640  1       Bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth
F11 0640 10    through a breakdown of the bony structure that supports
F11 0650  9    their roots. This serious condition, popularly known
F11 0660  4    as pyorrhea, is one of the chief causes of tooth loss
F11 0670  4    in adults.
F11 0670  6       Then, too, misplaced or jammed-together teeth are
F11 0680  3    prone to trapping food particles, increasing the likelihood
F11 0690  2    of rapid decay. "For these and other reasons", says
F11 0690 11    Dr& Brodie, "orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth".
F11 0710  1       The failure of teeth to fit together when closed
F11 0710 10    interferes with normal chewing, so that a child may
F11 0720  7    swallow food whole and put a burden on his digestive
F11 0730  4    system. Because of these chewing troubles, a child
F11 0730 12    may avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition.
F11 0740  9    Badly placed teeth can also cause such a speech handicap
F11 0750  9    as lisping.
F11 0750 11    #THE WHEN AND HOW OF STRAIGHTENING#
F11 0760  4    "MOST orthodontic work is done on children between
F11 0770  2    the ages of 10 and 14, though there have been patients
F11 0780  1    as young as two and as old as 55", says Dr& Brodie.
F11 0780 13       In the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of
F11 0790 11    teeth is usually completed, yet the continuing growth
F11 0800  5    of bony tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively
F11 0810  3    easy. Orthodontic work is possible because teeth are
F11 0820  2    held firmly but not rigidly, by a system of peridontal
F11 0820 12    membrane with an involved nerve network, to the bone
F11 0830  8    in the jaw; they are not anchored directly to the bone.
F11 0840  6    Abnormal pressure, applied over a period of time, produces
F11 0850  4    a change in the bony deposit, so a tooth functions
F11 0860  1    normally in the new position into which it has been
F11 0860 11    guided.
F11 0870  1       What can 10-year-old Susan expect when she enters
F11 0870 10    the orthodontist's office? On her first visit the orthodontist
F11 0880  8    will take ~X rays, photographs, tooth measurements,
F11 0890  4    and "tooth prints"- an impression of the mouth that
F11 0900  5    permits him to study her teeth and jaws.
F11 0910  1       If he decides to proceed, he will custom-make for
F11 0910 11    Susie an appliance consisting of bands, plastic plates,
F11 0920  6    fine wires, and tiny springs. This appliance will exert
F11 0930  4    a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure on
F11 0940  2    the bone. As the tooth moves, bone cells on the pressure
F11 0940 13    side of it will dissolve, and new ones will form on
F11 0950 11    the side from which the tooth has moved. This must
F11 0960  6    be done at the rate at which new bony tissue grows,
F11 0970  2    and no faster.
F11 0970  5       "If teeth are moved too rapidly, serious injury
F11 0980  2    can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding
F11 0990  1    bone holding them in place", explains Dr& Brodie. "Moving
F11 0990 10    one or two teeth can affect the whole system, and an
F11 1000 11    ill-conceived plan of treatment can disrupt the growth
F11 1010  7    pattern of a child's face".
F11 1020  1       During the first few days of wearing the appliance
F11 1020 10    and immediately following each adjustment, Susan may
F11 1030  6    have a slight discomfort or soreness, but after a short
F11 1040  5    time this will disappear. Parents are often concerned
F11 1050  2    that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay.
F11 1050 10    When in place, a well-cemented band actually protects
F11 1060  9    the part of the tooth that is covered.
F11 1070  4       Next Susie will enter the treatment stage and visit
F11 1080  3    the orthodontist once or twice a month, depending on
F11 1080 12    the severity of her condition. During these visits
F11 1090  7    the dentist will adjust the braces to increase the
F11 1100  6    pressure on her teeth.
F11 1100 10       Last comes the retention stage. Susie's teeth have
F11 1110  6    now been guided into a desirable new position. But
F11 1120  4    because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original
F11 1130  3    position, a retaining appliance is used to lock them
F11 1130 12    in place. Usually this is a thin band of wire attached
F11 1140 11    to the molars and stretching across the teeth. Susie
F11 1150  6    may wear this only at night or for a few hours during
F11 1160  5    the day.
F11 1160  7       Then comes the time when the last wire is removed
F11 1170  4    and Susie walks out a healthier and more attractive
F11 1180  1    girl than when she first went to the orthodontist.
F11 1180 10       How long will this take? Straightening one tooth
F11 1190  7    that has come in wrong may take only a few months.
F11 1200  6    Aligning all the teeth may take a year or more. An
F11 1210  2    added complication such as a malformed jaw may take
F11 1210 11    two or three years to correct.
F11 1220  4    #WHAT IS THE COST?#
F11 1220  8    THE charge for a complete full-banded job differs in
F11 1230  7    various parts of the country. Work that might cost
F11 1240  4    $500 to $750 in the South could cost $750 to $1,200
F11 1250  1    in New York City or Chicago. An average national figure
F11 1250 11    for two to three years of treatment would be $650 to
F11 1260 10    $1,000.
F11 1260 11       "Factors in the cost of treatment are the length
F11 1270  9    of time involved and the skill and education of the
F11 1280  5    practitioner", says Dr& Brodie.
F11 1290  1       To become an orthodontist, a man must first be licensed
F11 1290 10    by his state as a dentist, then he must spend at least
F11 1300  9    two years in additional training to acquire a license
F11 1310  5    as a specialist.
F11 1310  8       "Costs may seem high, but they used to be even higher",
F11 1320  8    says Dr& Brodie. "Fees are about half to a third of
F11 1330  8    what they were 25 years ago".
F11 1340  1       The reason? People today are aware of the value
F11 1340  9    of orthodontics, and as a result there are more practitioners
F11 1350  8    in the field.
F11 1350 11       Most orthodontists require an initial payment to
F11 1360  7    cover the cost of diagnostic materials and construction
F11 1370  4    of the appliances, but usually the remainder of the
F11 1380  3    cost may be spread over a period of months or years.
F11 1380 14    In many cities in the United States clinics associated
F11 1390  8    with dental schools will take patients at a nominal
F11 1400  7    fee. Some municipal agencies will pay for orthodontic
F11 1410  4    treatment for children of needy parents.
F11 1410 10    #RESEARCH HELPS FAMILIES#
F11 1420  3    GROWTH studies have been carried on consistently by
F11 1430  2    orthodontists. Dr& Brodie has 30-year records of head
F11 1430 11    growth, started 20 minutes after children's births.
F11 1440  7       "In the past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion
F11 1450 10    is hereditary was scoffed at; now we know that family
F11 1460  8    characteristics do affect tooth formation to a large
F11 1470  5    extent", he says. "Fortunately through our growth studies
F11 1480  3    we have been able to see what nature does, and that
F11 1490  1    helps us know what we can do".
F11 1490  8       This knowledge both modifies and dictates diagnosis
F11 1500  4    and treatment. For example, a boy may inherit a small
F11 1510  3    jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another.
F11 1510 12    In the past an orthodontist might have tried, over
F11 1520  7    four or five years, to straighten and fit the boy's
F11 1530  5    large teeth into a jaw that, despite some growth, would
F11 1540  2    never accommodate them. Now a dentist can recommend
F11 1540 10    extraction immediately.
F11 1550  2       In other cases, in view of present-day knowledge
F11 1560  1    of head growth, orthodontists will recommend waiting
F11 1560  8    four or five years before treatment. The child is kept
F11 1570  8    on call, and the orthodontist watches the growth. "Nature
F11 1580  5    often takes care of the problem", says Dr& Brodie.
F11 1590  4    "A child with a certain type of head and teeth will
F11 1600  2    outgrow tooth deformity".
F11 1600  5       That is why Dr& Brodie asks parents not to insist,
F11 1610  6    against their dentist's advice, that their child have
F11 1620  3    orthodontic work done too early. "Both because of our
F11 1630  1    culture's stress on beauty and our improved economic
F11 1630  9    conditions, some parents demand that the dentist try
F11 1640  8    to correct a problem before it is wise to do so. Let
F11 1650  7    the orthodontist decide the proper time to start treatment",
F11 1660  2    he urges.
F11 1660  4       Superior new material for orthodontic work is another
F11 1670  4    result of research. Plastics are easier to handle than
F11 1680  2    the vulcanized rubber formerly used, and they save
F11 1680 10    time and money. Plaster of Paris, once utilized in
F11 1690  7    making impressions of teeth, has been replaced by alginates
F11 1700  5    (gelatin-like material) that work quickly and accurately
F11 1710  3    and with least discomfort to a child.
F11 1710 10    #PREVENTION IS BEST#
F11 1720  2    AS a rule, the earlier general dental treatment is
F11 1720 11    started, the less expensive and more satisfactory it
F11 1730  8    is likely to be.
F11 1740  1       "After your child's baby teeth are all in- usually
F11 1740 10    at the age of two and one half to three- it's time
F11 1750 10    for that first dental appointment", Dr& Brodie advises.
F11 1760  4    "Then see that your youngster has a routine checkup
F11 1770  5    once a year".
F11 1770  8       To help prevent orthodontic problems from arising,
F11 1780  4    your dentist can do these things:
F11 1790  1    _@_
F11 1790  1       He can correct decay, thus preventing early loss
F11 1790  9    of teeth. If a child does lose his first teeth prematurely
F11 1800  9    because of decay- and if no preventive steps are taken-
F11 1810  8    the other teeth may shift out of position, become overcrowded
F11 1820  5    and malformed. In turn the other teeth are likely to
F11 1830  4    decay because food particles may become impacted in
F11 1830 12    them.
F12 0010  1    From time to time the medium mentions other people
F12 0010 10    "around him", who were "on the other side", and reports
F12 0020  9    what they are saying. After a while there come initials
F12 0030  6    and names, and he is interested to hear some rather
F12 0040  3    unusual family nicknames. As the hour progresses, the
F12 0050  1    sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more
F12 0050 11    personal and specific statements. There are a few prognoses
F12 0060  7    of coming events.
F12 0060 10    ##
F12 0070  1    ANOTHER MEDIUM, another sitter, would produce a somewhat
F12 0070  9    different content, but in general it would probably
F12 0080  8    sound much like the foregoing reading. Some mediums
F12 0090  4    speak in practical, down-to-earth terms, while others
F12 0100  2    may stress the spiritual. Not all, as a matter of fact,
F12 0100 13    consider themselves "mediums" in the sense of receiving
F12 0110  8    messages from the deceased. In fact, some sensitives
F12 0120  7    rule this out, preferring to consider their expression
F12 0130  4    as strictly extra-sensory perception (~ESP), on this
F12 0140  3    side of the "veil". However that may be, people are
F12 0150  1    known to go to mediums for diverse reasons. Perhaps
F12 0150 10    they are mourning a recent death and want comfort,
F12 0160  7    to feel in touch with the deceased, or seek indications
F12 0170  4    for future plans. They may, of course, be curiosity
F12 0180  1    seekers- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon
F12 0180 10    of mediumship.
F12 0190  1       The mediums with whom the Parapsychology Foundation
F12 0200  1    is working in this experiment are in a waking or only
F12 0200 12    slightly dissociated state, so that the sitter can
F12 0210  7    make comments, ask and answer questions, instead of
F12 0220  3    talking with a "control" who speaks through an entranced
F12 0230  2    sensitive. What we have here is in some ways more like
F12 0230 13    an ordinary conversation.
F12 0240  2       But it is not really only a conversation. Many a
F12 0250  3    sitter (in a personal sitting) has been amazed to realize
F12 0250 13    that the medium was describing very vividly his state
F12 0260  9    of mind. He himself might not have been really aware
F12 0270  7    of his own mood; it had been latent, unspecified, semi-conscious
F12 0280  4    and only partly realized- until she described it to
F12 0290  4    him! Most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability
F12 0300  1    to put a finger on "pre-conscious" moods and to clarify
F12 0300 12    them.
F12 0310  1       However, in the next visit that the researcher made
F12 0310 10    to the medium, he did not receive a personal reading.
F12 0320  8    Instead he brought with him the names of some people
F12 0330  7    he had never met and of whom the medium knew nothing.
F12 0340  3    For this was to be a "proxy sitting".
F12 0340 11    ##
F12 0340 12    AS WAS NOTED earlier, it is important that in valid,
F12 0350 10    objective study of this sort of communication, the
F12 0360  6    interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive.
F12 0370  4    Dr& Karlis Osis, Director of Research at the Parapsychology
F12 0380  3    Foundation, described the basis for the experiment
F12 0390  1    in a TOMORROW article, ("New Research on Survival After
F12 0400  1    Death", Spring 1958). He remarked: "It has been clearly
F12 0400 10    established that in a number of instances the message
F12 0410  9    did not come from a spirit but was received telepathically
F12 0420  6    by the medium from the sitter".
F12 0430  1       The possibility has to be ruled out that the medium's
F12 0430 11    ~ESP may tap the memory of the sitter, and to do this,
F12 0440 12    the two central characters in this drama must be separated.
F12 0450  8       One way to do this is by "proxy sittings", wherein
F12 0460  7    the person seeking a message does not himself meet
F12 0470  5    with the medium but is represented by a substitute,
F12 0480  1    the proxy sitter. If the latter knows nothing about
F12 0480 10    the absent sitter except his name (given by the experimenter),
F12 0490  8    he cannot possibly give any clues, conscious or unconscious,
F12 0500  7    far less ask leading questions. All he can do is to
F12 0510  7    be an objective and careful questioner, seeking to
F12 0520  2    help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific
F12 0520 11    her paranormal impressions.
F12 0530  2       Sometimes in these experiments "appointment sittings"
F12 0540  2    are used. Here the absent sitter makes a "date" with
F12 0550  2    a communicator (someone close to him who is deceased),
F12 0550 11    asking him to "come in" at a certain hour, when a channel
F12 0560 11    will be open for him. In this case the proxy sitter
F12 0570  8    will know only the name of the communicator, nothing
F12 0580  2    else. He gives this to the medium at the appointed
F12 0590  1    time, and the reading then will be concerned with material
F12 0590 11    about or messages from the communicator. As always,
F12 0600  6    a tape recording or detailed notes are made, and a
F12 0610  6    typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter.
F12 0620  1       So this proxy situation has set up at least a partial
F12 0620 12    barrier between the medium's ~ESP and the absent sitter's
F12 0630  9    mind. It is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis
F12 0640 10    for the statements- though research still does not
F12 0650  5    know how far afield ~ESP can range.
F12 0660  1    ##
F12 0660  2    NOW THE ORIGINAL absent sitter must decide whether
F12 0660 10    the statements are meaningful to him. Here again laboratory
F12 0670  9    approaches are being evolved, for it is recognized
F12 0680  8    how "elastic" these readings can be, how they can apply
F12 0690  7    to many people, and are often stated in general terms
F12 0700  4    all too easily applied to any individual's own case.
F12 0710  1    If you look at a reading meant for someone else, you
F12 0710 12    will probably see that many of the items could be considered
F12 0720 10    as applicable to you, even when you were not in the
F12 0730  8    picture at all! An interested sitter may think the
F12 0740  4    sensitive has made a "hit", describing something accurately
F12 0750  1    for him, but can he really be sure that another sitter,
F12 0750 12    hearing the same statement, would not apply it subjectively
F12 0760  9    to his own circumstances? It is, of course, easy to
F12 0770  7    see how "~J" will mean Uncle Jack to one person and
F12 0780  7    little Jane to another. "A journey", "a little white
F12 0790  3    house", "a change of outlook", can apply to many people.
F12 0800  2    And even more complex items can be interpreted to conform
F12 0810  1    to one's own point of view, which is by nature so personal.
F12 0810 13    One sitter may think "a leather couch" identifies a
F12 0820  8    reading as surely directed to him; to another, it seems
F12 0830  7    that nobody but his father ever used the phrase, "Atta
F12 0840  5    boy"!
F12 0840  6       To get around this quite difficult corner, there
F12 0850  3    is one first aid to objectiveness: prevent the distant
F12 0860  2    sitter from knowing which reading was for him. If he
F12 0860 12    is not told which of four or five readings was meant
F12 0870 11    for him, he can more readily assess each item in a
F12 0880  7    larger frame: "Does that statement really sound as
F12 0890  4    if it were for me, significant in my particular life?
F12 0900  1    Or am I taking something that could really apply to
F12 0900 11    almost anybody, and forgetting that many other people
F12 0910  7    probably have had a similar experience"?
F12 0920  2       Conversely, experimenters would consider as impressive
F12 0930  1    such statements as the following, which, if they turned
F12 0930 10    out to be hits, are so unusual as to be really significant:
F12 0940 12       "He had four children, two sets of twins. After
F12 0950  9    being a lawyer for twenty-five years he started studying
F12 0960  5    for the ministry. Part of his house had been moved
F12 0970  4    to the other side of the road. He died of typhoid in
F12 0980  1    1921".
F12 0980  2       Methods have been developed of assigning "weights"
F12 0990  1    to statements; that is, it is known empirically that
F12 0990 10    names beginning with ~R are more common than those
F12 1000  8    beginning with ~Z; that fewer women are named Miranda
F12 1010  6    than Elizabeth; that in the United States more people
F12 1020  4    die of heart disease than of smallpox. So each reading
F12 1030  1    can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding
F12 1030 13    up these weights. Specific dates would be important,
F12 1040  7    as would double names. Various categories have been
F12 1050  5    explored to find out about these "empirical probabilities"
F12 1060  2    against which to measure the readings.
F12 1060  8    ##
F12 1060  9    IN THE PARAPSYCHOLOGY FOUNDATION'S long-range experiment,
F12 1070  7    readings are made by a variety of sensitives for a
F12 1080 10    large number of cooperating sitters, trying to throw
F12 1090  5    light on this question of the significance of mediumistic
F12 1100  3    statements. It is very important indeed, in the field
F12 1110  1    of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the
F12 1110 10    survival hypothesis, to know whether the statements
F12 1120  6    are actually only those which any intuitive person
F12 1130  3    might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself.
F12 1140  1    Or, on the other hand, are unlikely facts being stated,
F12 1140 11    facts which are in themselves significant and not easily
F12 1150  7    applicable to everybody? That is one thing the experiments
F12 1160  7    are designed to find out.
F12 1170  1       So, after the sitting has been held, several readings
F12 1170 10    at one time are mailed, and the distant sitter (whose
F12 1180  8    name or whose communicator's name was given to the
F12 1190  6    medium) must mark each little item as Correct (Hit),
F12 1200  2    Incorrect (Miss), Doubtful, or Especially Significant
F12 1200  8    (applying to him and, he feels, not to anyone else).
F12 1210 10    He is required to mark every item and to indicate which
F12 1220  8    reading he feels is actually his. All these evaluations
F12 1230  4    are then totted up and tabulated, by adding up the
F12 1240  3    Hits and Significants, with the weight placed on those
F12 1240 12    in the sitter's own reading. That is, if he marks as
F12 1250 10    most correct a reading not meant for him, the total
F12 1260  7    experimental score falls.
F12 1270  1       Conversely, if he gives a heavy rating to his own
F12 1270 10    reading, and finds more accurate facts in it than in
F12 1280  7    the others, a point is chalked up for the intrinsic,
F12 1290  3    objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic
F12 1290 10    material. And there are some positive results, though
F12 1300  8    the final findings will not be known for a long time-
F12 1310  9    and then further research can be formulated.
F12 1320  3       In another approach to the same procedure, the content
F12 1330  2    of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular
F12 1330 14    medium is likely to slant her statements. Does she
F12 1340  9    often speak of locations, of cause of death? Does she
F12 1350  7    accurately give dates, ages, kind of occupation? It
F12 1360  4    is possible to find out in which categories most of
F12 1370  2    her correct statements fall, and where she makes most
F12 1370 11    of her "hits". Now when, so to speak, the cream has
F12 1380  9    been skimmed off, and the items in the successful categories
F12 1390  6    separated out, the sitter can be asked to consider
F12 1400  3    and rate only this concentrated "cream", where the
F12 1410  1    sensitive is at her best.
F12 1410  6    ##
F12 1410  7    MEDIUMISTIC IMPRESSIONS are evidently of all sorts
F12 1420  4    and seem to involve all the senses. "I feel cold",
F12 1430  1    the medium says, or "My leg aches", "My head is heavy".
F12 1440  1    Or perhaps she hears words or sounds: "There's such
F12 1440 10    a noise of loud machinery", or "I hear a child crying",
F12 1450 10    or "He says we're all here and glad to see you". Maybe
F12 1460 10    an entire scene comes into consciousness, with action
F12 1470  5    and motion, or a static view: "a house under a pine
F12 1480  5    tree, with a little stone path going up to the door".
F12 1490  1    The sensitive often seems to smell definite odors,
F12 1490  9    too, or subjectively feels emotions. Sometimes she
F12 1500  5    displays amazing eidetic imagery and seems to see all
F12 1510  6    details in perspective, as if the scene were actually
F12 1520  1    there. If pressed by the sitter for more detail, she
F12 1520 11    may be able to bring the picture more into focus and
F12 1530  9    see more sharply, almost as if she were physically
F12 1540  6    going closer.
F12 1540  8       If asked how she gets her impressions, she probably
F12 1550  5    can only say that she "just gets them"- some more vividly
F12 1560  6    than others. Perhaps this is not so extraordinary after
F12 1570  2    all. Even in normal experience one gets impressions
F12 1570 10    without knowing exactly how- of atmosphere, of one
F12 1580  8    another's personalities, moods, intentions.
F12 1590  3       Of course, there is an element of training here:
F12 1600  2    these gifted people, by concentration, study, guidance,
F12 1605  1    have learned to develop their power. Simply using it
F12 1610  9    increases its intensity, I was told by one sensitive.
F12 1620  7       Nor does a medium automatically know how to interpret
F12 1630  5    her imagery. Impressions often appear in a symbolic
F12 1640  3    form and cannot be taken at face value. It is apparently
F12 1650  1    by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious,
F12 1650 10    and the medium has to translate these into meaning.
F12 1660  7    If communication with an entity on the "other side"
F12 1670  5    is taking place, this too may assume the form of clairvoyant
F12 1680  3    symbolism.
F12 1680  4       During one reading an image appeared of a prisoner
F12 1690  4    in irons. But this did not necessarily refer to an
F12 1700  1    actual jail; taken with other details it could have
F12 1700 10    referred to a state of mental or spiritual confinement.
F12 1710  6    In this connection it is worth noting how names are
F12 1720  5    sometimes obtained. Though they are often heard clairaudiently,
F12 1730  2    as if a voice were speaking them, in other cases they
F12 1740  1    are apprehended visually as symbols: a slope to signify
F12 1740 10    the name "Hill", for instance. One medium saw two sheets
F12 1750  9    flapping on a line and found that the name Shietz was
F12 1760  8    significant to the sitter.
F13 0010  1    _@_
F13 0010  2       Farming is confining. The farmer's life must be
F13 0010 10    arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock.
F13 0020  9       Livestock must be tended every day, routinely. A
F13 0030  6    slight change in the work schedule may cut the production
F13 0040  4    of cows or chickens.
F13 0040  8       Even if there are no livestock, the farmer cannot
F13 0050  5    leave the farm for long periods, particularly during
F13 0060  2    the growing season.
F13 0060  5       The worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs
F13 0070  4    readily. He cannot leave the farm to take work in another
F13 0080  3    locality on short notice; such a move may mean a loss
F13 0080 14    of capital.
F13 0090  2    _@_
F13 0090  3       Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a
F13 0090 11    part of farm life. The farmer must get up early, and,
F13 0100 11    at times, work late at night. Frequently he must work
F13 0110  7    long hours in the hot sun or cold rain. No matter how
F13 0120  5    well work is planned, bad weather or unexpected setbacks
F13 0130  2    can cause extra work that must be caught up.
F13 0130 11       It may not be profitable for a part-time farmer
F13 0140  9    to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time
F13 0150  5    farmer can invest in profitably.
F13 0150 10    _@_
F13 0150 11       Production may fall far below expectations. Drought,
F13 0160  7    hail, disease, and insects take their toll of crops.
F13 0170  6    Sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into
F13 0180  4    the owner's earnings, even into his capital.
F13 0190  1    _@_
F13 0190  1       Returns for money and labor invested may be small
F13 0190 10    even in a good year.
F13 0200  2       The high cost of land, supplies, and labor make
F13 0200 11    it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis.
F13 0210  9    Land within commuting distance of a growing city is
F13 0230  7    usually high in price, higher if it has subdivision
F13 0240  2    possibilities. Part-time farmers generally must pay
F13 0240  9    higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because
F13 0250  9    they buy in smaller quantities. If the farm is in an
F13 0260  8    industrial area where wages are high, farm labor costs
F13 0270  4    will also be high.
F13 0270  8       A part-time farmer needs unusual skill to get as
F13 0280  6    high production per hen, per cow, or per acre as can
F13 0290  3    be obtained by a competent full-time farmer. It will
F13 0290 13    frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most
F13 0300  9    up-to-date equipment. He may have to depend upon custom
F13 0310  7    service for specialized operations, such as spraying
F13 0320  4    or threshing, and for these, he may have to wait his
F13 0330  1    turn. There will be losses caused by emergencies that
F13 0330 10    arise while he is away at his off-farm job.
F13 0340  8    _@_
F13 0340  9       The farm may be an additional burden if the main
F13 0350  5    job is lost. This may be true whether the farm is owned
F13 0360  2    or rented.
F13 0360  4       If the farm is rented, the rent must be paid. If
F13 0370  2    it is owned, taxes must be paid, and if the place is
F13 0370 14    not free of mortgage, there will be interest and payments
F13 0390  2    on the principal to take care of.
F13 0390  9    _ADVANTAGES_
F13 0400  1       _@_
F13 0400  1       A farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment
F13 0400  9    for children. It gives them room to play and plenty
F13 0410  9    of fresh air. The children can do chores adapted to
F13 0420  5    their age and ability. Caring for a calf, a pig, or
F13 0430  2    some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility
F13 0430 11    for work.
F13 0440  2    _@_
F13 0440  3       Part-time farming gives a measure of security if
F13 0440 12    the regular job is lost, provided the farm is owned
F13 0450 10    free of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed
F13 0460  6    expenses and minimum living costs.
F13 0470  1    _@_
F13 0470  2       For some retired persons, part-time farming is a
F13 0470 11    good way to supplement retirement income. It is particularly
F13 0480  8    suitable for those who need to work or exercise out
F13 0490  8    of doors for their health.
F13 0500  1    _@_
F13 0500  1       Generally, the same level of living costs less in
F13 0510  7    the country than in the city. The savings are not as
F13 0520  9    great, however, as is sometime supposed. Usually, the
F13 0530  3    cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the
F13 0540  2    farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat
F13 0540 11    more. Where schools, fire and police protection, and
F13 0550  8    similar municipal services are of equal quality in
F13 0560  6    city and country, real estate taxes are usually about
F13 0570  3    the same.
F13 0570  5    _@_
F13 0570  6       A part-time farmer and his family can use their
F13 0580  3    spare time profitably.
F13 0580  6    _@_
F13 0580  7       Some persons consider the work on a farm recreational.
F13 0590  6    For some white-collar workers it is a welcome change
F13 0600  3    from the regular job, and a physical conditioner.
F13 0600 11    #LAND, LABOR, AND EQUIPMENT NEEDED#
F13 0610  5    Part-time farming can take comparatively little land,
F13 0620  3    labor, and equipment- or a great deal. It depends on
F13 0630  2    the kind and the scale of the farming operation.
F13 0630 11       General requirements for land, labor, and equipment
F13 0640  7    are discussed below. Specific requirements for each
F13 0650  4    of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages
F13 0660  3    8 to 14.
F13 0660  6    _LAND_
F13 0660  7       Three quarters to 1 acre of good land is enough
F13 0670  3    for raising fruits and vegetables for home use, and
F13 0670 12    for a small flock of chickens, a cow, and two pigs.
F13 0680 10    You could not, of course, raise feed for the livestock
F13 0690  6    on a plot this small.
F13 0690 11       If you want to raise feed or carry out some enterprise
F13 0710  8    on a larger scale, you'll need more land.
F13 0720  4       In deciding how much land you want, take into account
F13 0730  2    the amount you'll need to bring in the income you expect.
F13 0730 13    But consider also how much you and your family can
F13 0740 10    keep up along with your other work. The cost of land
F13 0750  7    and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence
F13 0760  4    your decision. Some part-time farmers buy more land
F13 0770  2    than they need in anticipation of suburban development.
F13 0770 10    This is a highly speculative venture.
F13 0780  5       Sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part
F13 0790  4    of a larger tract. When surplus land is not expensive
F13 0800  1    to buy or to keep up, it is usually better to buy it
F13 0800 14    than to buy so small an acreage that the development
F13 0810  8    of adjoining properties might impair the residential
F13 0820  4    value of the farm.
F13 0820  8    _LABOR_
F13 0820  9       If you have a year-round, full-time job you can't
F13 0830  8    expect to grow much more than your family uses- unless
F13 0840  4    other members of the family do a good deal of the work
F13 0850  3    or you hire help. As a rule, part-time farmers hire
F13 0850 14    little help.
F13 0860  2       In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by
F13 0860 11    family labor, compare the amount of labor that can
F13 0870  8    be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various
F13 0880  6    enterprises listed in table 1.
F13 0890  1       List the number of hours the family can be expected
F13 0890 10    to work each month. You may want to include your own
F13 0900  8    regular vacation period if you have one. Do not include
F13 0910  5    all your spare time or all your family's spare time-
F13 0920  1    only what you are willing to use for farm work.
F13 0930  1    _EQUIPMENT_
F13 0930  1       If you are going to produce for home use only, you
F13 0930 12    will need only hand tools. You will probably want to
F13 0940  8    hire someone to do the plowing, however.
F13 0950  2       For larger plantings, you'll need some kind of power
F13 0960  1    for plowing, harrowing, disking, and cultivating. If
F13 0960  8    you have a planting of half an acre or more you may
F13 0970  9    want to buy a small garden tractor (available for $300
F13 0980  4    to $500 with attachments, 1960 prices). These tractors
F13 0990  2    are not entirely satisfactory for plowing, particularly
F13 0990  9    on heavier soils, so you may still want to hire someone
F13 1000 10    to do the plowing.
F13 1010  1       Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem
F13 1010 11    to the small-scale farmer. If you are going to farm
F13 1020 10    for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must
F13 1030  7    keep in mind the needed machinery investments when
F13 1040  2    you choose among farm enterprises.
F13 1040  7       You can keep your machinery investment down by buying
F13 1050  6    good secondhand machinery, by sharing the cost and
F13 1060  4    upkeep of machinery with a neighbor, and by hiring
F13 1070  1    someone with machinery to do certain jobs. If an expensive
F13 1070 11    and specialized piece of machinery is needed- such
F13 1080  7    as a spray rig, a combine, or a binder- it is better
F13 1090  7    to pay someone with a machine to do the work.
F13 1100  1    #SELECTING A FARM#
F13 1100  4    Before you look for a farm you'll need to know (1)
F13 1110  4    the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake;
F13 1110 14    and (2) whether you want to buy or rent.
F13 1130  8       Information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in deciding
F13 1140  6    on the kind and scale of your farming venture.
F13 1150  1       If you are not well acquainted with the area in
F13 1150 11    which you wish to locate, or if you are not sure that
F13 1160 10    you and your family will like and make a success of
F13 1170  6    farming, usually you would do better to rent a place
F13 1180  3    for a year or two before you buy.
F13 1180 11       Discussed below are some of the main things to look
F13 1190  8    for when you select a part-time farm.
F13 1200  1    _LOCATION_
F13 1200  2       _NEARNESS TO WORK.-_
F13 1200  5       Choose a location within easy commuting distance
F13 1210  3    of both the regular job and other employment opportunities.
F13 1220  1    Then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have
F13 1220 10    to sell the farm. The presence of alternative job opportunities
F13 1230  9    also will make the place easier to sell if that should
F13 1240 10    become desirable.
F13 1250  1       Obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road.
F13 1260  1    _NEARNESS TO MARKETS.-_
F13 1260  1       If you grow anything to sell you will need markets
F13 1260 11    nearby. If you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole
F13 1270 10    milk, for example, you should be close to a town or
F13 1280  9    city.
F13 1290  1    _KIND OF NEIGHBORHOOD.-_
F13 1290  1       Look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes.
F13 1290 12    There are slums in the country as well as in the city.
F13 1300 10    Few rural areas are protected by zoning. A tavern,
F13 1310  5    filling station, junk yard, rendering plant, or some
F13 1320  3    other business may go up near enough to hurt your home
F13 1320 14    or to hurt its value.
F13 1330  4    _FACILITIES IN THE AREA.-_
F13 1330  8       Check on the schools in the area, the quality of
F13 1340  7    teaching, and the provision for transportation to and
F13 1350  3    from them.
F13 1350  5       Find out whether fire protection, sewage system,
F13 1360  2    gas, water mains, and electrical lines are available
F13 1360 10    in the locality. If these facilities are not at the
F13 1370  9    door, getting them may cost more than you expect. You
F13 1380  7    may have to provide them yourself or get along without
F13 1390  4    them.
F13 1390  5       You cannot get along without an adequate supply
F13 1400  2    of pure water. If you are considering a part-time farm
F13 1400 13    where the water must be provided by a well, find out
F13 1410 11    if there is a good well on the farm or the probable
F13 1420  7    cost of having one drilled. A pond may provide adequate
F13 1430  3    water for livestock and garden. Pond water can be filtered
F13 1440  1    for human use, but most part-time farmers would not
F13 1440 11    want to go to so much trouble. The following amounts
F13 1450  8    of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic
F13 1460  5    uses.
F13 1460  6    _TOPOGRAPHY AND SOIL_
F13 1460  9       Is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise?
F13 1470  9    If you can't tell, get help from your county agricultural
F13 1480  6    agent or other local specialist. Soil type, drainage,
F13 1490  4    or degree of slope can make the difference between
F13 1500  1    good crops and poor ones. Small areas that aren't right
F13 1500 11    for a certain crop may lie next to areas that are well
F13 1510 10    suited to that crop.
F13 1520  1    _THE HOUSE_
F13 1520  2       Will the house on any part-time farm you are considering
F13 1530  1    make a satisfactory full-time residence? How much will
F13 1530 10    it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating?
F13 1540  7    If the house is not wired adequately for electricity
F13 1550  5    or if plumbing or a central heating system must be
F13 1560  4    installed, check into the cost of making these improvements.
F13 1570  1    #BUYING A FARM#
F13 1570  4    The value of the farm to you will depend on-
F13 1580  1    _@_
F13 1580  2       Its worth as a place to live.
F13 1580  9    _@_
F13 1580 10       The value of the products you can raise on it.
F13 1590  8    _@_
F13 1590  9       The possibilities of selling the property later
F13 1600  4    on for suburban subdivision.
F13 1600  8       Decide first what the place is worth to you and
F13 1610  9    your family as a home in comparison with what it would
F13 1620  5    cost to live in town. Take into account the difference
F13 1630  1    in city and county taxes, insurance rates, utility
F13 1630  9    rates, and the cost of travel to work.
F13 1640  7       Next, estimate the value of possible earnings of
F13 1650  3    the farm. To do this, set up a plan on paper for operating
F13 1660  1    the farm. List the kind and quantity of things the
F13 1660 11    farm can be expected to produce in an average year.
F13 1670  8    Estimate the value of the produce at normal prices.
F13 1680  4    The total is the probable gross income from farming.
F13 1690  1       To find estimated net farm income, subtract estimated
F13 1700  1    annual farming expenditures from probable gross income
F13 1700  8    from farming. Include as expenditures an allowance
F13 1710  5    for depreciation of farm buildings and equipment. Also
F13 1720  4    count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed
F13 1730  2    by the family. It may be hard to decide what this labor
F13 1740  1    is worth, but charge something for it. Otherwise, you
F13 1740 10    may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your
F13 1750  9    labor.
F13 1750 10       To figure the value of the farm in terms of investment
F13 1760  9    income, divide the estimated annual net farm income
F13 1770  5    by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest
F13 1780  3    if the money were invested in some other way.
F14 0010  1    Everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate
F14 0010 10    had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective
F14 0020  9    dirge. For almost two months, the defendant and the
F14 0030  5    world heard from individuals escaped from the grave
F14 0040  2    about fathers and mothers, graybeards, adolescents,
F14 0040  8    babies, starved, beaten to death, strangled, machine-gunned,
F14 0050  7    gassed, burned. One who had been a boy in Auschwitz
F14 0060  8    had to tell how children had been selected by height
F14 0070  3    for the gas chambers. The gruesome humor of the Nazis
F14 0080  1    was not forgotten- the gas chamber with a sign on it
F14 0080 12    with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a
F14 0090  8    copper Star of David- nor the gratuitous sadism of
F14 0100  5    ~SS officers. Public relations strategists everywhere,
F14 0110  2    watching the reaction of the German press, the liberal
F14 0120  1    press, the lunatic-fringe press, listening to their
F14 0120  9    neighbors, studying interviews with men and women on
F14 0130  7    the street, cried out: Too much, too much- the mind
F14 0140  5    of the audience is becoming dulled, the horrors are
F14 0150  2    losing their effect. And still another witness, one
F14 0150 10    who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses, had
F14 0160  9    to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves
F14 0170  6    head to foot one on top of the other before being shot.
F14 0180  3    **h
F14 0180  4       Most of this testimony may have been legally admissible
F14 0190  2    as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total Nazi
F14 0200  1    crime but seemed subject to question when not tied
F14 0200 10    to the part in it of the defendant's Department of
F14 0210  6    Jewish Affairs. Counsel for the defense, however, shrewdly
F14 0220  4    allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful
F14 0230  3    recollections, rarely raised an objection. Would not
F14 0230 10    the emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this
F14 0240  8    awfulness have a calming, if not exhausting, effect
F14 0250  5    likely to improve his client's chances? Those who feared
F14 0260  4    "emotionalism" at the Trial showed less understanding
F14 0270  2    than Dr& Servatius of the route by which man achieves
F14 0280  1    the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies.
F14 0280  8    Interruptions came largely from the bench, which numerous
F14 0300  7    times rebuked the Attorney General for letting his
F14 0310  5    witnesses run on, though it, too, made no serious effort
F14 0320  2    to choke off the flow.
F14 0320  7       But there was a contrast even more decisive than
F14 0330  4    a hunger for fact between the Trial in Jerusalem and
F14 0340  2    those in Moscow and New York. In each of the last,
F14 0340 13    the trial marked the beginning of a new course: in
F14 0350  9    Moscow the liquidation of the Old Bolsheviks and the
F14 0360  7    tightening of Stalin's dictatorship; in the United
F14 0370  4    States the initiation of militant anti-Communism, with
F14 0380  2    the repentant ex-Communist in the vanguard. These trials
F14 0380 11    were properly termed "political cases" in that the
F14 0390  8    trial itself was a political act producing political
F14 0400  6    consequences. But what could the Eichmann Trial initiate?
F14 0410  4    Of what new course could it mark the beginning? The
F14 0420  2    Eichmann case looked to the past, not to the future.
F14 0430  1    It was the conclusion of the first phase of a process
F14 0430 12    of tragic recollection, and of refining the recollection,
F14 0440  6    that will last as long as there are Jews. As such,
F14 0450  5    it was beyond politics and had no need of justification
F14 0460  1    by a "message".
F14 0460  4    ##
F14 0460  5    "IT IS NOT AN individual that is in the dock at this
F14 0470  8    historical trial"- said Ben Gurion, "and not the Nazi
F14 0480  5    regime alone- but anti-Semitism throughout history".
F14 0490  2    How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which
F14 0490 11    to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder
F14 0500  9    of millions of Jews without being an anti-Semite contribute
F14 0510  7    to a verdict against anti-Semitism? And if it was not
F14 0520  6    an individual who was in the dock, why was the Trial,
F14 0530  4    as we shall observe later, all but scuttled in the
F14 0540  1    attempt to prove Eichmann a "fiend"? These questions
F14 0540  9    touch the root of confusion in the prosecution's case.
F14 0550  8       It might be contended, of course, that Eichmann
F14 0560  5    in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying
F14 0570  4    or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism.
F14 0580  1    But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind
F14 0580 13    of case outlined by Ben Gurion and set forth in the
F14 0590  9    indictment. In such a case the defendant should serve
F14 0600  5    as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue
F14 0610  4    by argument. One who could be linked to anti-Semitism
F14 0620  1    only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good
F14 0620 10    specimen of the Jew-baiter throughout the ages. Shout
F14 0630  7    at Eichmann though he might, the Prosecutor could not
F14 0640  5    establish that the defendant was falsifying the way
F14 0650  3    he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell into
F14 0650 15    the generally recognized category of anti-Semitism.
F14 0660  6    Yes, he believed that the Jews were "enemies of the
F14 0670  6    Reich", and such a belief is, of course, typical of
F14 0680  3    "patriotic" anti-Semites; but he believed in the Jew-as-enemy
F14 0690  4    in a kind of abstract, theological way, like a member
F14 0700  1    of a cult speculating on the nature of things. The
F14 0700 11    real question was how one passed from anti-Semitism
F14 0710  7    of this sort to murder, and the answer to this question
F14 0720  4    is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself. In regard
F14 0725  2    to Eichmann, it was to be found in the Nazi outlook,
F14 0730 10    which contained a principle separate from and far worse
F14 0740  8    than anti-Semitism, a principle by which the poison
F14 0750  6    of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent. Perhaps
F14 0760  2    under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could,
F14 0770  1    as Eichmann declared, feel personally friendly toward
F14 0770  8    the Jews and still be their murderer. Not through fear
F14 0780 10    of disobeying orders, as Eichmann kept trying to explain,
F14 0790  7    but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance
F14 0800  7    of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation
F14 0810  5    of history and grew with each of Hitler's victories
F14 0820  2    into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical
F14 0830  1    rightness that was able to respond to any proposal,
F14 0830 10    and the more outrageous the better, "Well, let's try
F14 0840  6    it". At any rate, the substance of Eichmann's testimony
F14 0850  4    was that all his actions flowed from his membership
F14 0860  3    in the party and the ~SS, and though the Prosecutor
F14 0870  1    did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews,
F14 0870 11    his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic
F14 0880 10    lesson weakened to that extent.
F14 0890  3    ##
F14 0890  4    BUT IF THE Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania
F14 0900  3    so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it
F14 0900 15    happened to light, neither did it warn very effectively
F14 0910  9    against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis
F14 0920  7    made such effective use in Germany and wherever else
F14 0930  4    they could find it. If anti-Semitism was on trial in
F14 0940  2    Jerusalem, why was it not identified, and with enough
F14 0940 11    emphasis to capture the notice of the world press,
F14 0950  9    in its connection with the activities of Eichmann's
F14 0960  4    Department of Jewish Affairs, as exemplified by the
F14 0970  3    betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party
F14 0970 14    anti-Semites in Germany, as well as in Poland, Czechoslovakia,
F14 0980  9    Hungary? The infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich
F14 0990  8    in January 1942, to organize the material and technical
F14 1000  8    means to put to death the eleven million Jews spread
F14 1010  6    throughout the nations of Europe, was attended by representatives
F14 1020  4    of major organs of the German state, including the
F14 1030  2    Reich Minister of the Interior, the State Secretary
F14 1030 10    in charge of the Four Year Plan, the Reich Minister
F14 1040 10    of Justice, the Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs.
F14 1050  6    The measures for annihilation proposed and accepted
F14 1060  4    at the Conference affected industry, transportation,
F14 1070  1    civilian agencies of government. Heydrich, in opening
F14 1070  8    the Conference, followed the reasoning and even the
F14 1080  7    phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering
F14 1090  5    which authorized the Final Solution as " a complement
F14 1100  4    to" previous "solutions" for eliminating the Jews from
F14 1110  2    German living space through violence, economic strangulation,
F14 1120  1    forced emigration, and evacuation. In other words,
F14 1120  8    the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that
F14 1130  8    physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension
F14 1140  5    of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every
F14 1150  3    phase of German life, and that the new conspiracy counted
F14 1150 13    on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures
F14 1160 10    effective, as a readiness for murder. This, in fact,
F14 1170  8    it turned out to be. Since the magnitude of the plan
F14 1180  6    made secrecy impossible, once the wheels had began
F14 1190  2    to turn, persons controlling German industries, social
F14 1190  9    institutions, and armed forces became, through their
F14 1200  7    anti-Semitism or their tolerance of it, conscious accomplices
F14 1210  6    of Hitler's crimes; whether in the last degree or a
F14 1220  7    lesser one was a matter to be determined individually.
F14 1230  1       What more could be asked for a Trial intended to
F14 1230 11    warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity
F14 1240  9    to expose the exact link between the respectable anti-Semite
F14 1250  8    and the concentration-camp brute? Not in Eichmann's
F14 1260  5    anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober
F14 1270  4    German man of affairs lay the potential warning of
F14 1280  2    the Trial. No doubt many of the citizens of the Third
F14 1280 13    Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an "innocent"
F14 1290  8    dislike of Jews, as do others like them today. The
F14 1300  8    Final Solution proved that the Jew-baiter of any variety
F14 1310  6    exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality
F14 1320  2    and madness of others. Ought not an edifying Trial
F14 1320 11    have made every effort to demonstrate this once and
F14 1330  9    for all by showing how representative types of "mere"
F14 1340  5    anti-Semites were drawn step by step into the program
F14 1350  5    of skull-bashings and gassings? The Prosecutor in his
F14 1360  3    opening remarks did refer to "the germ of anti-Semitism"
F14 1370  1    among the Germans which Hitler "stimulated and transformed".
F14 1370  9    But if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over
F14 1380 11    Eichmann's head at his collaborators in the societies
F14 1390  7    where he functioned, the press seems to have missed
F14 1400  5    it.
F14 1400  6    ##
F14 1400  7    NOR DID THE Trial devote much attention to exposing
F14 1410  4    the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis, both
F14 1420  2    in building their own power and in destroying that
F14 1420 11    of rival organizations and states. Certainly, one of
F14 1430  6    the best ways of warning the world against anti-Semitism
F14 1440  5    is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon.
F14 1450  2    Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the
F14 1450 13    enemy-Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man
F14 1460  9    of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors.
F14 1470  8    Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution
F14 1480  6    of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries
F14 1490  4    contributed to terrorizing the populations, splitting
F14 1500  1    apart individuals and groups, arousing the meanest
F14 1500  8    and most dishonest impulses, pulverizing trust and
F14 1510  5    personal dignity, and finally forcing people to follow
F14 1520  5    their masters into the abyss by making them partners
F14 1530  2    in unspeakable crimes? The career of Eichmann made
F14 1530 10    the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization:
F14 1540  8    fearful of being mistaken for a Jew, he seeks protection
F14 1550 10    in his Nazi uniform; clinging to the enemy-Jew idea,
F14 1560  7    he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness;
F14 1570  4    once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal
F14 1580  4    opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania
F14 1590  1    and envy of those above him. "Is this the type of citizen
F14 1590 13    you desire"? the Trial should have asked the nations.
F14 1600  9    But though this characterization in no way diminished
F14 1610  6    Eichmann's guilt, the Prosecutor, more deeply involved
F14 1620  4    in the tactics of a criminal case than a political
F14 1630  2    one, would have none of it.
F14 1630  8       Finally, if the mission of the Trial was to convict
F14 1640  7    anti-Semitism, how could it have failed to post before
F14 1650  4    the world the contrasting fates of the countries in
F14 1650 13    which the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters-
F14 1660 10    i&e&, Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia- and
F14 1670  6    those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity-
F14 1680  7    Denmark, Holland, Italy, Bulgaria, France? Should not
F14 1690  4    everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding
F14 1700  2    fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism
F14 1710  1    proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom
F14 1710 10    than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots
F14 1720  6    from the transports? Wasn't this meaning of Eichmann's
F14 1730  5    experience in various countries worth highlighting?
F14 1750  1    ##
F14 1750  2    AS THE FIRST collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage,
F14 1760  5    the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the
F14 1770  3    Jews from the shock of the death camps, a recovery
F14 1770 13    that took fifteen years and which is still by no means
F14 1780  9    complete (though let no one believe that it could be
F14 1790  6    hastened by silence). Only across a distance of time
F14 1800  3    could the epic accounting begin. It is already difficult
F14 1800 12    to recall how little we knew before the Trial of what
F14 1810 11    had been done to the Jews of Europe. It is not that
F14 1820  9    the facts of the persecution were unavailable; most
F14 1830  3    of the information elicited in Jerusalem had been brought
F14 1840  3    to the surface by the numerous War Crimes tribunals
F14 1840 12    and investigating commissions, and by reports, memoirs,
F14 1850  7    and survivors' accounts.
F15 0010  1    IN POUGHKEEPSIE, N& Y&, in 1952, a Roman Catholic hospital
F15 0020  1    presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum
F15 0020  8    to quit the Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign
F15 0030  7    from the hospital staff. Three agreed, but four declined
F15 0040  6    and were suspended. After a flood of protests, they
F15 0050  3    were reinstated at the beginning of 1953. The peace
F15 0060  1    of the community was badly disturbed, and people across
F15 0070  7    the nation, reading of the incident, felt uneasy.
F15 0080  4       In New York City in 1958, the city's Commissioner
F15 0090  2    of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide
F15 0100  1    a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device. He
F15 0100  9    thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving
F15 0110  5    Protestants, Jews and Roman Catholics that continued
F15 0120  4    for two months, until the city's Board of Hospitals
F15 0130  3    lifted the ban on birth-control therapy.
F15 0130 10       A year later in Albany, N& Y&, a Roman Catholic
F15 0140  9    hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his
F15 0150  6    connection with the Planned Parenthood Association.
F15 0160  2    Immediately, the religious groups of the city were
F15 0170  1    embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion
F15 0170 10    of a man's right to freedom of religious belief and
F15 0180  8    conscience.
F15 0180  9       These incidents, typical of many others, dramatize
F15 0190  6    the distressing fact that no controversy during the
F15 0200  4    last several decades has caused more tension, rancor
F15 0210  2    and strife among religious groups in this country than
F15 0210 11    the birth-control issue. It has flared up periodically
F15 0220  7    on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided
F15 0230  5    over birth-prevention regulations in municipal hospitals
F15 0240  3    and health and family-welfare agencies. It has erupted
F15 0250  1    on the national level in the matter of including birth-control
F15 0260  1    information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped
F15 0260  9    countries. Where it is not actually erupting, it rumbles
F15 0270  8    and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano, ready
F15 0280  5    to explode at any moment.
F15 0280 10       The time has come for citizens of all faiths to
F15 0290 10    unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome
F15 0300  5    issue from the political and social life of our nation.
F15 0310  4       The first step toward the goal is the establishment
F15 0320  1    of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly
F15 0320 11    communication on other than the polemical level. Instead
F15 0330  8    of emotional recrimination, loaded phrases and sloganeering,
F15 0340  5    we need a dispassionate study of the facts, a better
F15 0350  6    understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more
F15 0360  1    serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until
F15 0360 10    a solution is reached.
F15 0370  2       "All too frequently", points out James O'Gara, managing
F15 0380  2    editor of Commonweal, "Catholics run roughshod over
F15 0390  1    Protestant sensibilities in this matter, by failure
F15 0390  8    to consider the reasoning behind the Protestant position
F15 0400  6    and, particularly, by their jibes at the fact that
F15 0410  6    Protestant opinion on birth control has changed in
F15 0420  2    recent decades". All too often our language is unduly
F15 0425  1    harsh.
F15 0430  1       The second step is to recognize the substantial
F15 0430  9    agreement- frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate
F15 0440  7    newspaper reporting- already existing between Catholics
F15 0450  7    and non-Catholics concerning the over-all objectives
F15 0460  4    of family planning. Instead of Catholics' being obliged
F15 0470  2    or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number
F15 0480  1    of offspring, as many non-Catholics imagine, the ideal
F15 0480 10    of responsible parenthood is stressed. Family planning
F15 0490  6    is encouraged, so that parents will be able to provide
F15 0500  6    properly for their offspring.
F15 0500 10       Pope Pius /12, declared in 1951 that it is possible
F15 0510 10    to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood
F15 0520  6    for a long time and even for the whole duration of
F15 0530  4    married life, if there are serious reasons, such as
F15 0540  1    those often mentioned in the so-called medical, eugenic,
F15 0540 10    economic and social "indications". This means that
F15 0550  6    such factors as the health of the parents, particularly
F15 0560  5    the mother, their ability to provide their children
F15 0570  2    with the necessities of life, the degree of population
F15 0570 11    density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities
F15 0580 10    may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining
F15 0590  7    the number of offspring.
F15 0600  1       These are substantially the same factors considered
F15 0600  8    by non-Catholics in family planning. The laws of many
F15 0610  8    states permit birth control only for medical reasons.
F15 0620  5    The Roman Catholic Church, however, sanctions a much
F15 0630  4    more liberal policy on family planning.
F15 0630 10       Catholics, Protestants and Jews are in agreement
F15 0640  7    over the objectives of family planning, but disagree
F15 0650  5    over the methods to be used. The Roman Catholic Church
F15 0660  3    sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method, also
F15 0670  1    known as the use of the infertile or safe period. The
F15 0670 12    Church considers this to be the method provided by
F15 0680  8    nature and its divine Author: It involves no frustration
F15 0690  5    of nature's laws, but simply an intelligent and disciplined
F15 0700  3    use of them. With the exception of the Roman Catholic
F15 0710  2    and the Orthodox Catholic Churches, most churches make
F15 0710 10    no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical
F15 0720  7    or chemical contraceptives, allowing the couple free
F15 0730  5    choice.
F15 0730  6       Here is a difference in theological belief where
F15 0740  4    there seems little chance of agreement. The grounds
F15 0750  2    for the Church's position are Scriptural (Old Testament),
F15 0760  1    the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early
F15 0760 11    Church, the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries,
F15 0770  6    the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority
F15 0780  3    and the natural law. The latter plays a prominent role
F15 0790  2    in Roman Catholic theology and is considered decisive,
F15 0800  1    entirely apart from Scripture, in determining the ethical
F15 0800  9    character of birth-prevention methods.
F15 0810  4       The Roman Catholic natural-law tradition regards
F15 0820  2    as self-evident that the primary objective purpose
F15 0820 10    of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering
F15 0830 10    of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary
F15 0840  8    and subjective end. This conclusion is based on two
F15 0850  5    propositions: that man by the use of his reason can
F15 0860  2    ascertain God's purpose in the universe and that God
F15 0860 11    makes known His purpose by certain "given" physical
F15 0870  7    arrangements.
F15 0880  1       Thus, man can readily deduce that the primary objective
F15 0880  9    end of the conjugal act is procreation, the propagation
F15 0890  6    of the race. Moreover, man may not supplant or frustrate
F15 0900  6    the physical arrangements established by God, who through
F15 0910  4    the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for
F15 0920  1    the control of conception. Believing that God is the
F15 0920 10    Author of this law and of all laws of nature, Roman
F15 0930  9    Catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those
F15 0940  5    laws, not frustrate or mock them.
F15 0940 11       Let it be granted then that the theological differences
F15 0950  9    in this area between Protestants and Roman Catholics
F15 0960  5    appear to be irreconcilable. But people differ in their
F15 0970  5    religious beliefs on scores of doctrines, without taking
F15 0980  2    up arms against those who disagree with them. Why is
F15 0980 12    it so different in regard to birth control? It is because
F15 0990 11    each side has sought to implement its distinctive theological
F15 1000  7    belief through legislation and thus indirectly force
F15 1010  5    its belief, or at least the practical consequences
F15 1020  2    thereof, upon others.
F15 1020  5       It is always a temptation for a religious organization,
F15 1030  5    especially a powerful or dominant one, to impose through
F15 1040  5    the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint
F15 1050  1    upon others. Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have
F15 1050  9    succumbed to this temptation in the past.
F15 1060  7       Consider what happened during World War /1,, when
F15 1070  5    the Protestant churches united to push the Prohibition
F15 1080  2    law through Congress. Many of them sincerely believe
F15 1090  1    that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree
F15 1090 13    is intrinsically evil and sinful. With over four million
F15 1100  8    American men away at war, Protestants forced their
F15 1110  3    distinctive theological belief upon the general public.
F15 1120  2    With the return of our soldiers, it soon became apparent
F15 1120 12    that the belief was not shared by the great majority
F15 1130 10    of citizens. The attempt to enforce that belief ushered
F15 1140  6    in a reign of bootleggers, racketeers, hijackers and
F15 1150  3    gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled
F15 1160  1    in our history. The so-called "noble experiment" came
F15 1160 10    to an inglorious end.
F15 1170  3       That tumultuous, painful and costly experience shows
F15 1180  2    clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot
F15 1180 11    be enforced when it has little correspondence with
F15 1190  7    the general view of society. That experience holds
F15 1200  4    a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today.
F15 1210  2       Up to the turn of the century, contraception was
F15 1210 11    condemned by all Christian churches as immoral, unnatural
F15 1220  8    and contrary to divine law. This was generally reflected
F15 1230  8    in the civil laws of Christian countries. Today, the
F15 1240  4    Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches stand virtually
F15 1250  3    alone in holding that conviction. The various Lambeth
F15 1260  1    Conferences, expressing the Anglican viewpoint, mirror
F15 1260  7    the gradual change that has taken place among Protestants
F15 1270  8    generally.
F15 1280  1       In 1920, the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908
F15 1280  9    condemnation of contraception and issued "an emphatic
F15 1290  5    warning against the use of unnatural means for the
F15 1300  4    avoidance of conception, together with the grave dangers-
F15 1310  3    physical, moral, and religious- thereby incurred, and
F15 1310 10    against the evils which the extension of such use threaten
F15 1320 10    the race". Denouncing the view that the sexual union
F15 1330  7    is an end in itself, the Conference declared: "We steadfastly
F15 1340  4    uphold what must always be regarded as the governing
F15 1350  4    considerations of Christian marriage. One is the primary
F15 1360  2    purpose for which marriage exists, namely, the continuance
F15 1370  1    of the race through the gift and heritage of children;
F15 1370 11    the other is the paramount importance in married life
F15 1380  7    of deliberate and thoughtful self-control". The Conference
F15 1390  5    called for a vigorous campaign against the open or
F15 1400  4    secret sale of contraceptives.
F15 1400  8       In 1930, the Lambeth Conference again affirmed the
F15 1410  5    primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of
F15 1420  4    children, but conceded that, in certain limited circumstances,
F15 1430  1    contraception might be morally legitimate.
F15 1430  6       In 1958, the Conference endorsed birth control as
F15 1440  7    the responsibility laid by God on parents everywhere.
F15 1450  5       Many other Protestant denominations preceded the
F15 1460  3    Anglicans in such action. In March, 1931, 22 out of
F15 1470  2    28 members of a committee of the Federal Council of
F15 1470 12    Churches ratified artificial methods of birth control.
F15 1480  6    "As to the necessity", the committee declared, "for
F15 1490  5    some form of effective control of the size of the family
F15 1500  5    and the spacing of children, and consequently of control
F15 1510  1    of conception, there can be no question **h. There
F15 1510 10    is general agreement also that sex union between husbands
F15 1520  7    and wives as an expression of mutual affection without
F15 1530  5    relation to procreation is right".
F15 1540  1       Since then, many Protestant denominations have made
F15 1540  8    separate pronouncements, in which they not only approved
F15 1550  8    birth control, but declared it at times to be a religious
F15 1560  8    duty. What determines the morality, they state, is
F15 1570  4    not the means used, but the motive. In general, the
F15 1580  3    means (excluding abortion) that prove most effective
F15 1580 10    are considered the most ethical.
F15 1590  5       This development is reflected in the action taken
F15 1600  4    in February, 1961, by the general board of the National
F15 1610  1    Council of Churches, the largest Protestant organization
F15 1610  8    in the ~US. The board approved and commended the use
F15 1620  9    of birth-control devices as a part of Christian responsibility
F15 1630  8    in family planning. It called for opposition to laws
F15 1640  6    and institutional practices restricting the information
F15 1650  3    or availability of contraceptives.
F15 1650  7       The general board declared: "Most of the Protestant
F15 1660  7    churches hold contraception and periodic continence
F15 1670  4    to be morally right when the motives are right **h.
F15 1680  3    The general Protestant conviction is that motives,
F15 1680 10    rather than methods, form the primary moral issue,
F15 1690  8    provided the methods are limited to the prevention
F15 1700  5    of conception".
F15 1700  7       An action once universally condemned by all Christian
F15 1710  5    churches and forbidden by the civil law is now not
F15 1720  5    only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant
F15 1730  1    denominations, but also deemed, at certain times, to
F15 1730  9    be a positive religious duty. This viewpoint has now
F15 1740  7    been translated into action by the majority of people
F15 1750  7    in this country. Repeated polls have disclosed that
F15 1760  3    most married couples are now using contraceptives in
F15 1760 11    the practice of birth control.
F15 1770  5       For all concerned with social-welfare legislation,
F15 1780  2    the significance of this radical and revolutionary
F15 1790  1    change in the thought and habits of the vast majority
F15 1790 11    of the American people is clear, profound and far-reaching.
F15 1800  8    To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction
F15 1810  5    of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to
F15 1820  5    invite the same breakdown of law and order that was
F15 1830  1    occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment.
F15 1830  8       This brings us to the fact that the realities we
F15 1840  9    are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation,
F15 1850  6    but in the realm of conscience and religion: They are
F15 1860  3    moral judgments and matters of theological belief.
F15 1870  1    Conscience and religion are concerned with private
F15 1870  8    sin: The civil law is concerned with public crimes.
F15 1880  7    Only confusion, failure and anarchy result when the
F15 1890  6    effort is made to impose upon the civil authority the
F15 1900  2    impossible task of policing private homes to preclude
F15 1900 10    the possibility of sin. Among the chief victims of
F15 1910  9    such an ill-conceived imposition would be religion
F15 1920  5    itself.
F16 0010  1    ##
F16 0010  2    On April 17, 1610, the sturdy little three-masted bark,
F16 0010 12    Discovery, weighed anchor in St& Katherine's Pool,
F16 0020  7    London, and floated down the Thames toward the sea.
F16 0030  8    She carried, besides her captain, a crew of twenty-one
F16 0040  6    and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the Arctic
F16 0050  4    waters of North America.
F16 0050  8       Seventeen months later, on September 6, 1611, an
F16 0060  6    Irish fishing boat sighted the Discovery limping eastward
F16 0070  3    outside Galway Bay. When she reached port, she was
F16 0080  3    found to have on board only eight men, all near starvation.
F16 0080 14    The captain was gone, and the mate was gone. The man
F16 0090 11    who now commanded her had started the voyage as an
F16 0100  8    ordinary seaman.
F16 0100 10       What disaster struck the Discovery during those
F16 0110  6    seventeen months? What happened to the fourteen missing
F16 0120  5    men? These questions have remained one of the great
F16 0130  5    sea mysteries of all time. For hundreds of years, the
F16 0140  1    evidence available consisted of (1) the captain's fragmentary
F16 0140  9    journal, (2) a highly prejudiced account by one of
F16 0150  9    the survivors, (3) a note found in a dead man's desk
F16 0160  7    on board, and (4) several second-hand reports. All
F16 0170  3    told, they offered a highly confused picture.
F16 0170 10       But since 1927, researchers digging into ancient
F16 0180  7    court records and legal files have been able to find
F16 0190  7    illuminating pieces of information. Not enough to do
F16 0200  4    away with all doubts, but sufficient to give a fairly
F16 0200 14    accurate picture of the events of the voyage.
F16 0210  8       Historians have had two reasons for persisting so
F16 0220  6    long in their investigations. First, they wanted to
F16 0230  4    clarify a tantalizing, bizarre enigma. Second, they
F16 0230 11    believed it important to determine the fate of the
F16 0240  9    captain- a man whose name is permanently stamped on
F16 0250  6    our maps, on American towns and counties, on a great
F16 0260  4    American river, and on half a million square miles
F16 0270  1    of Arctic seas.
F16 0270  4       The name: Henry Hudson.
F16 0270  8       This is the story of his last tragic voyage, as
F16 0280 10    nearly as we are able- or ever, probably, will be able-
F16 0290  6    to determine:
F16 0290  8       The sailing in the spring of 1610 was Hudson's fourth
F16 0300  8    in four years. Each time his objective had been the
F16 0310  6    same- a direct water passage from Western Europe to
F16 0320  3    the Far East. In 1607 and 1608, the English Muscovy
F16 0330  1    Company had sent him northward to look for a route
F16 0330 11    over the North Pole or across the top of Russia. Twice
F16 0340  8    he had failed, and the Muscovy Company indicated it
F16 0350  4    would not back him again.
F16 0350  9       In 1609, the Dutch East India Company hired Hudson,
F16 0360  7    gave him two learned geographers, fitted him out with
F16 0370  5    a ship called the Half Moon, and supplied him with
F16 0380  3    Dutch sailors. This time he turned westward, to the
F16 0390  1    middle Atlantic coast of North America. His chief discovery
F16 0390 10    was important- the Great North (later, the Hudson)
F16 0400  9    River- but it produced no northwest passage.
F16 0410  4    ##
F16 0410  5    When the Half Moon put in at Dartmouth, England, in
F16 0420  4    the fall of 1609, word of Hudson's findings leaked
F16 0430  2    out, and English interest in him revived. The government
F16 0440  1    forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship.
F16 0440 10    He thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking
F16 0450  8    to men of wealth. By springtime, he was supported by
F16 0460  5    a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of Henry,
F16 0470  3    Prince of Wales. He had obtained and provisioned a
F16 0470 12    veteran ship called the Discovery and had recruited
F16 0480  8    a crew of twenty-one, the largest he had ever commanded.
F16 0490  7       The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear. A century
F16 0500  7    of exploration had established that a great land mass,
F16 0510  5    North and South America, lay between Europe and the
F16 0520  2    Indies. One by one, the openings in the coast that
F16 0520 12    promised a passage through had been explored and discarded.
F16 0530  8    In fact, Hudson's sail up the Great North River had
F16 0540  8    disposed of one of the last hopes.
F16 0550  1       But there remained one mysterious, unexplored gap,
F16 0550  8    far to the north. Nearly twenty-five years before,
F16 0560  8    Captain John Davis had noted, as he sailed near the
F16 0570  7    Arctic Circle, "a very great gulf, the water whirling
F16 0580  3    and roaring, as it were the meeting of tides". He named
F16 0590  2    this opening, between Baffin Island and Labrador, the
F16 0590 10    "Furious Overfall". (Later, it was to be called Hudson
F16 0600  9    Strait.)
F16 0610  1       In 1602, George Waymouth, in the same little Discovery
F16 0610 10    that Hudson now commanded, had sailed 300 miles up
F16 0620  9    the strait before his frightened men turned the ship
F16 0630  6    back. Hudson now proposed to sail all the way through
F16 0640  3    and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway.
F16 0640 13       Even Hudson, experienced in Arctic sailing and determined
F16 0650  9    as he was, must have had qualms as he slid down the
F16 0660 11    Thames. Ahead were perilous, ice-filled waters. On
F16 0670  5    previous voyages, it had been in precisely such dangerous
F16 0680  3    situations that he had failed as a leader and captain.
F16 0690  1    On the second voyage, he had turned back at the frozen
F16 0690 12    island of Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a
F16 0700  9    certificate stating that he did so of his own free
F16 0710  8    will- which was obviously not the case. On the third
F16 0720  3    voyage, a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between
F16 0720 12    Dutch and English crew members on the Half Moon had
F16 0730 10    almost forced him to head the ship back to Amsterdam
F16 0740  8    in mid-Atlantic.
F16 0740 11       Worse, his present crew included five men who had
F16 0750  9    sailed with him before. Of only one could he be sure-
F16 0760  7    young John Hudson, his second son. The mate, Robert
F16 0770  3    Juet, who had kept the journal on the half Moon, was
F16 0780  2    experienced- but he was a bitter old man, ready to
F16 0780 12    complain or desert at any opportunity. Philip Staffe,
F16 0790  7    the ship's carpenter, was a good worker, but perversely
F16 0800  6    independent. Arnold Lodley and Michael Perse were like
F16 0810  4    the rest- lukewarm, ready to swing against Hudson in
F16 0820  2    a crisis.
F16 0820  4       But men willing to sail at all into waters where
F16 0830  1    wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to
F16 0830 11    find. Hudson knew he had to use these men as long as
F16 0840 11    he remained an explorer. And he refused to be anything
F16 0850  6    else.
F16 0850  7       It is believed that Hudson was related to other
F16 0860  5    seafaring men of the Muscovy Company and was trained
F16 0870  1    on company ships. He was a Londoner, married, with
F16 0870 10    three sons. (The common misconception that he was Dutch
F16 0880  8    and that his first name was Hendrik stem from Dutch
F16 0890  6    documents of his third voyage.) In 1610, Hudson was
F16 0900  3    probably in his early forties, a good navigator, a
F16 0900 12    stubborn voyager, but otherwise fatally unsuited to
F16 0910  7    his chosen profession.
F16 0920  1    ##
F16 0920  2    Hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred
F16 0920 10    only a few miles down the Thames. There at the river's
F16 0930 10    edge waited one Henry Greene, whom Hudson listed as
F16 0940  6    a "clerk". Greene was in actuality a young ruffian
F16 0950  4    from Kent, who had broken with his parents in order
F16 0960  2    to keep the company he preferred- pimps, panders and
F16 0960 11    whores. He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted
F16 0970 10    his backers to see on board and he had Greene wait
F16 0980  6    at Gravesend, where the Discovery picked him up.
F16 0990  3       For the first three weeks, the ship skirted up the
F16 1000  1    east coast of Great Britain, then turned westward.
F16 1000  9    On May 11, she reached Iceland. Poor winds and fog
F16 1010  7    locked her up in a harbor the crew called "Lousie Bay".
F16 1020  5    The subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome.
F16 1030  3    With Hudson looking on, his protege Greene picked a
F16 1040  2    fight with the ship's surgeon, Edward Wilson. The issue
F16 1040 11    was settled on shore, Greene winning and Wilson remaining
F16 1050  9    ashore, determined to catch the next fishing boat back
F16 1060  8    to England. With difficulty, Hudson persuaded him to
F16 1070  5    rejoin the ship, and they sailed from Iceland.
F16 1080  1    ##
F16 1080  2    Early in June, the Discovery passed "Desolation" (southern
F16 1090  2    Greenland) and in mid-June entered the "Furious Overfall".
F16 1100  1    Floating ice bore down from the north and west. Fog
F16 1100 11    hung over the route constantly. Turbulent tides rose
F16 1110  8    as much as fifty feet. The ship's compass was useless
F16 1120  6    because of the nearness of the magnetic North Pole.
F16 1130  3       As the bergs grew larger, Hudson was forced to turn
F16 1140  4    south into what is now Ungava Bay, an inlet of the
F16 1150  1    great strait. After finding that its coasts led nowhere,
F16 1150 10    however, he turned north again, toward the main, ice-filled
F16 1160  9    passageway- and the crew, at first uneasy, then frightened,
F16 1170  7    rebelled.
F16 1170  8       The trouble was at least partly Juet's doing. For
F16 1180  8    weeks he had been saying that Hudson's idea of sailing
F16 1190  5    through to Java was absurd. The great, crushing ice
F16 1200  3    masses coming into view made him sound like the voice
F16 1210  1    of pure reason. A group of sailors announced to Hudson
F16 1210 11    that they would sail no farther.
F16 1220  4       Instead of quelling the dissension, as many captains
F16 1230  2    of the era would have done (Sir Francis Drake lopped
F16 1230 12    a man's head off under similar circumstances), Hudson
F16 1240  7    decided to be reasonable. He went to his cabin and
F16 1250  7    emerged carrying a large chart, which he set up in
F16 1260  5    view of the crew. Patiently, he explained what he knew
F16 1270  1    about their course and their objectives.
F16 1270  7       When Hudson had finished, the "town meeting" broke
F16 1280  5    down into a general, wordy argument. One man remarked
F16 1290  4    that if he had a hundred pounds, he would give ninety
F16 1300  1    of them to be back in England. Up spoke carpenter Staffe,
F16 1300 12    who said he wouldn't give ten pounds to be home. The
F16 1310 11    statement was effective. The meeting broke up. Hudson
F16 1320  7    was free to sail on.
F16 1320 12    ##
F16 1320 13    All through July the Discovery picked her way along
F16 1330  9    the 450-mile-long strait, avoiding ice and rocky islands.
F16 1340  7    On August 3, two massive headlands reared out of the
F16 1350  6    mists- great gateways never before, so far as Hudson
F16 1360  5    knew, seen by Europeans. To starboard was a cape a
F16 1370  2    thousand feet high, patched with ice and snow, populated
F16 1370 11    by thousands of screaming sea birds. To port was a
F16 1380  9    point 200 feet high rising behind to a precipice of
F16 1390  5    2,000 feet. Hudson named the capes Digges and Wolstenholme,
F16 1400  2    for two of his backers.
F16 1400  7       Hudson pointed the Discovery down the east coast
F16 1410  5    of the newly discovered sea (now called Hudson Bay),
F16 1420  3    confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the
F16 1430  1    Pacific. After three weeks' swift sailing, however,
F16 1430  8    the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river
F16 1440  8    deltas. The ship halted. The great "sea to the westwards"
F16 1450  6    was a dead end.
F16 1450 10       This must have been Hudson's blackest discovery.
F16 1460  5    For he seemed to sense at once that before him was
F16 1470  5    no South Sea, but the solid bulk of the North American
F16 1480  2    continent. This was the bitter end, and Hudson seemed
F16 1480 11    to know he was destined to failure.
F16 1490  7       Feverishly, he tried to brush away this intuition.
F16 1500  4    North and south, east and west, back and forth he sailed
F16 1510  3    in the land-locked bay, plowing furiously forward until
F16 1510 12    land appeared, then turning to repeat the process,
F16 1520  8    day after day, week after week. Hundreds of miles to
F16 1530  6    the north, the route back to England through the "Furious
F16 1540  4    Overfall" was again filling with ice.
F16 1550  1       The men were at first puzzled, then angered by the
F16 1550 11    aimless tacking. Once more, Juet's complaints were
F16 1560  6    the loudest. Hudson's reply was to accuse the mate
F16 1570  6    of disloyalty. Juet demanded that Hudson prove his
F16 1580  2    charges in an open trial.
F16 1580  7       The trial was held September 10. Hudson, presiding,
F16 1590  4    heard Juet's defense, then called for testimony from
F16 1600  2    crew members. Juet had made plentiful enemies, several
F16 1600 10    men stepped forward. Hands on Bible, seaman Lodley
F16 1610  8    and carpenter Staffe swore that Juet had tried to persuade
F16 1620  8    them to keep muskets and swords in their cabins. Cook
F16 1630  5    Bennett Mathues said Juet had predicted bloodshed on
F16 1640  3    the ship. Others added that Juet had wanted to turn
F16 1640 13    the ship homeward.
F16 1650  3       Hudson deposed Juet and cut his pay. The new mate
F16 1660  2    was Robert Bylot, talented but inexperienced. There
F16 1660  9    were other shifts and pay cuts according to the way
F16 1670  9    individuals had conducted themselves. The important
F16 1680  3    result, however, was that Juet and Francis Clemens,
F16 1690  2    the deposed boatswain, became Hudson's sworn enemies.
F16 1700  1       As Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of
F16 1700  9    the little bay, every incident lessened the crew's
F16 1710  7    respect for him. Once, after the Discovery lay for
F16 1720  6    a week in rough weather, Hudson ordered the anchor
F16 1730  3    raised before the sea had calmed. Just as it was being
F16 1740  1    hauled inboard, a sea hit the ship. Michael Butt and
F16 1740 11    Adame Moore were thrown off the capstan and badly injured.
F16 1750  9    The anchor cable would have been lost overboard, but
F16 1760  6    Philip Staffe was on hand to sever it with his axe.
F17 0010  1       Thomas Douglas, fifth Earl of Selkirk, a noble humanitarian
F17 0020  1    Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his
F17 0020 11    native Highlands, conceived a plan to settle them in
F17 0030  8    the valley of the Red River of the North. Since the
F17 0040  6    land he desired lay within the great northern empire
F17 0050  2    of the Hudson's Bay Company, he purchased great blocks
F17 0050 11    of the Comany's stock with the view to controlling
F17 0060  9    its policies. Having achieved this end, he was able
F17 0070  7    to buy 116,000 square miles in the valleys of the Red
F17 0080  5    and Assiniboine rivers. The grant, which stretched
F17 0090  1    southward to Lake Traverse- the headwaters of the Red-
F17 0090 10    was made in May, 1811, and by October of that year
F17 0100 11    a small group of Scots was settling for the winter
F17 0110  6    at York Factory on Hudson Bay. Thus at the same time
F17 0120  5    that William Henry Harrison was preparing to pacify
F17 0130  1    the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning fame
F17 0130  9    at the battle of Tippecanoe, Anglo-Saxon settlement
F17 0140  6    made a great leap into the center of the North American
F17 0150  6    continent to the west of the American agricultural
F17 0160  2    frontier.
F17 0160  3       Seven hundred miles south of York Factory, at "the
F17 0170  3    Forks" of the Red and the Assiniboine, twenty-three
F17 0180  1    men located a settlement in August 1812. By October
F17 0180 10    the little colony about Fort Douglas (present-day Winnipeg)
F17 0190  8    numbered 100. Within a few years the Scots, engaged
F17 0200  7    in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil
F17 0210  4    of the valley, were joined by a group called Meurons.
F17 0220  1    The latter, members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries
F17 0220 10    transported by Great Britain to Canada to fight the
F17 0230  9    Americans in the War of 1812, had settled in Montreal
F17 0240  8    and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815. Selkirk
F17 0250  6    persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to Red
F17 0260  3    River where they were to serve as a military force
F17 0260 13    to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest
F17 0270  7    Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into
F17 0280  5    the fur traders' empire. The mercenaries were little
F17 0290  3    interested in farming and added nothing to the output
F17 0290 12    of the farm plots on which all work was still done
F17 0300 11    with hoes as late as 1818.
F17 0310  2       It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the
F17 0310 13    ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal
F17 0320 10    of the settlement southward. When late in the summer
F17 0330  7    the full extent of the damage was assessed, all but
F17 0340  4    fifty of the Scots, Swiss and metis moved up the Red
F17 0350  3    to the mouth of the Pembina river. Here they built
F17 0350 13    huts and a stockade named Fort Daer after Selkirk's
F17 0360  8    barony in Scotland. The new site was somewhat warmer
F17 0370  7    than Fort Douglas and much closer to the great herds
F17 0380  5    of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for
F17 0390  1    food.
F17 0390  2       The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their
F17 0390 10    move southward by British fur traders. For many years
F17 0400  9    the Northwest Company had its southern headquarters
F17 0410  5    at Prairie du Chien on the Mississippi River, some
F17 0420  3    300 miles southeast of present-day St& Paul, Minnesota.
F17 0430  2    When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign
F17 0430 12    firm out of the United States, its British-born employees,
F17 0440 10    now become American citizens- Joseph Rolette, Joseph
F17 0450  4    Renville and Alexis Bailly- continued in the fur business.
F17 0460  8    On Big Stone Lake near the headwaters of the Red River,
F17 0470  6    Robert Dickson, Superintendent of the Western Indian
F17 0480  4    Department of Canada, had a trading post and planned
F17 0490  1    in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men
F17 0490 13    and two small artillery pieces. His trading goods came
F17 0500  7    from Canada to the Forks of Red River and from Selkirk's
F17 0510  7    settlement he brought them south in carts. These carts
F17 0520  5    were of a type devised in Pembina in the days of Alexander
F17 0530  3    Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk
F17 0540  1    colony was begun. In 1802 Henry referred to "our new
F17 0540 11    carts" as being about four feet off the ground and
F17 0550  9    carrying five times as much as a horse could pack.
F17 0560  5    They were held together by pegs and withes and in later
F17 0570  3    times drawn by a single ox in thills.
F17 0570 11       It was Dickson who suggested to Lord Selkirk that
F17 0580  7    he return to the Atlantic coast by way of the United
F17 0590  6    States. In September 1817 at Fort Daer (Pembina) Dickson
F17 0600  2    met the noble lord whom, with the help of a band of
F17 0600 14    Sioux, he escorted to Prairie du Chien. During the
F17 0610  9    trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois
F17 0620  6    territory to Indiana and the eastern United States
F17 0630  3    was the best route for goods from England to reach
F17 0640  1    Red River and that the United States was a better source
F17 0640 12    of supply for many goods than either Canada or England.
F17 0650  9    Upon arriving at Baltimore, Selkirk on December 22
F17 0660  6    wrote to John Quincy Adams, Secretary of State at Washington,
F17 0670  6    inquiring about laws covering trade with "Missouri
F17 0680  3    and Illinois Territories". This traffic, he declared
F17 0690  2    prophetically, "tho' it might be of small account at
F17 0690 11    first, would increase with the progress of our Settlements
F17 0700  9    **h".
F17 0710  1       The route which he had traveled and which he believed
F17 0710 10    might develop into a trade route was followed by his
F17 0720  9    settlers earlier than he might have expected. In 1819
F17 0730  5    grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at "the Forks"
F17 0740  2    (Fort Douglas) and in December 1819, twenty men left
F17 0740 11    Fort Daer for the most northerly American outpost at
F17 0750  9    Prairie du Chien. It was a three-month journey in the
F17 0760  9    dead of winter followed by three months of labor on
F17 0770  5    Mackinac boats. With these completed and ice gone from
F17 0780  3    the St& Peter's River (present-day Minnesota river)
F17 0790  1    their 250 bushels of wheat, 100 bushels of oats and
F17 0790 11    barley and 30 bushels of peas and some chickens were
F17 0800  7    loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats and rowed up the
F17 0810  5    river to Big Stone Lake, across into Lake Traverse,
F17 0820  1    and down the Red. They reached Fort Douglas in June
F17 0820 11    1820. This epic effort to secure seed for the colony
F17 0830  9    cost Selkirk @1,040. Nevertheless so short was the
F17 0840  6    supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat
F17 0850  4    to Fort Daer for food. Thereafter seed and food became
F17 0860  1    more plentiful and the colony remained in the north
F17 0860 10    the year round.
F17 0870  1       Activity by British traders and the presence of
F17 0870  9    a colony on the Red prompted the United State War Department
F17 0880 10    in 1819 to send Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Leavenworth
F17 0890  5    from Detroit to put a post 300 miles northwest of Prairie
F17 0900  6    du Chien, until then the most advanced United States
F17 0910  3    post. In September 1822 two companies of infantry arrived
F17 0920  2    at the mouth of the St& Peter's River, the head of
F17 0920 13    navigation on the Mississippi, and began construction
F17 0930  7    of Fort St& Anthony which, upon completion, was renamed
F17 0940  7    in honor of its commander, Colonel Josiah Snelling.
F17 0950  4       It was from the American outposts that Red River
F17 0960  4    shortages of livestock were to be made good. Hercules
F17 0970  1    L& Dousman, fur trader and merchant at Prairie du Chien,
F17 0970 11    contracted to supply Selkirk's people with some 300
F17 0980  8    head of cattle, and Alexis Bailly and Francois Labothe
F17 0990  6    were hired as drovers. Bailly, after leaving Fort Snelling
F17 1000  5    in August 1821, was forced to leave some of the cattle
F17 1010  5    at the Hudson's Bay Company's post on Lake Traverse
F17 1020  2    "in the Sieux Country" and reached Fort Garry, as the
F17 1030  1    Selkirk Hudson's Bay Company center was now called,
F17 1030  9    late in the fall. He set out on his 700-mile return
F17 1040 10    journey with five families of discontented and disappointed
F17 1050  5    Swiss who turned their eyes toward the United States.
F17 1060  4    Observing their distressing condition, Colonel Snelling
F17 1070  2    allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on
F17 1070 10    the military reservation.
F17 1080  2       As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk settlement
F17 1090  2    to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota,
F17 1090 10    Dousman of Michilimackinac, Michigan, and Prairie du
F17 1100  7    Chien was traveling to Red River to open a trade in
F17 1110  9    merchandise. Early in 1822 he was at Fort Garry offering
F17 1120  5    to bring in pork, flour, liquor and tobacco. Alexander
F17 1130  2    McDonnell, governor of Red River, and James Bird, a
F17 1140  2    chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, ordered such
F17 1140 11    "sundry articles" to a value of @4,500.
F17 1150  7       For its part the Hudson's Bay Company was troubled
F17 1160  5    by the approach of American settlement. As the time
F17 1170  4    drew near for the drawing of the British-American frontier
F17 1180  1    by terms of the agreement of 1818, the company suspected
F17 1180 11    that the Pembina colony- its own post and Fort Daer-
F17 1190  9    was on American territory. Accordingly Selkirk's agents
F17 1200  5    ordered the settlers to move north, and by October,
F17 1210  5    John Halkett had torn down both posts, floating the
F17 1220  2    timber to "the Forks" in rafts. "I have done everything",
F17 1230  1    he wrote, "to break up the whole of that unfortunate
F17 1230 11    establishment **h". Despite Company threats, duly carried
F17 1240  7    through, to cut off supplies of powder, ball, and thread
F17 1250  8    for fishing nets, about 350 persons stayed in the village.
F17 1260  6    They would attempt to bring supplies from St& Louis
F17 1270  4    or Prairie du Chien at "great expense as well as danger".
F17 1280  3       At Fort Garry some of the Swiss also decided to
F17 1290  2    cast their lot with the United States, and in 1823
F17 1290 12    several families paid guides to take them to Fort Snelling.
F17 1300  9    The disasters of 1825-1826 caused more to leave. After
F17 1310  6    heavy rains and an onslaught of mice, snow fell on
F17 1320  4    October 15, 1825, and remained on the ground through
F17 1330  1    a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet
F17 1330 14    thick. In April came a rapid thaw that produced high
F17 1340  8    waters which did not recede until mid-June. On June
F17 1350  5    24 more than 400 families started the three-month trip
F17 1360  2    across the plains to the Mississippi. By fall, 443
F17 1360 11    survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about
F17 1370  8    Fort Snelling, but most of them were sent on to Galena
F17 1380  9    and St& Louis, with a few going as far as Vevay, Indiana,
F17 1390  6    a notable Swiss center in the United States. In 1837,
F17 1400  4    157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were
F17 1410  1    living on the reservation at Fort Snelling.
F17 1410  8       Below the fort, high bluffs extended uninterruptedly
F17 1420  5    for six miles along the Mississippi River. At the point
F17 1430  5    where they ended, another settlement grew up around
F17 1440  3    a chapel built at the boat landing by Father Lucian
F17 1440 13    Galtier in 1840. Its people, including Pierre Bottineau
F17 1450  8    and other American Fur Company employees and the refugees
F17 1460  7    from Fort Garry, were joined by the remaining Scots
F17 1470  6    and Swiss from Fort Snelling when Major Joseph Plympton
F17 1480  3    expelled them from the reservation in May 1840. The
F17 1490  2    resultant town, platted in 1847 and named for the patron
F17 1490 12    of Father Galtier's mission, St& Paul, was to become
F17 1500  8    an important center of the fur trade and was to take
F17 1510  9    on a new interest for those Selkirkers who remained
F17 1520  3    at Red River.
F17 1520  6       While population at Fort Garry increased rapidly,
F17 1530  4    from 2,417 in 1831 to 4,369 in 1840, economic opportunities
F17 1540  2    did not increase at a similar rate. Accordingly, though
F17 1550  1    the practice violated the no-trading provision of the
F17 1550 10    Selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in
F17 1560  7    merchandise and furs to the Hudson's Bay Company, some
F17 1570  5    settlers went into trade. The Company maintained a
F17 1580  3    store at which products of England could be purchased
F17 1590  1    and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding
F17 1590 12    that they refrain from trading in furs. Despite this
F17 1600  8    prohibiton, by 1844 some of the Fort Garry merchants
F17 1610  6    were trading with the Indians for furs. In June 1845,
F17 1620  4    the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20
F17 1630  3    per cent duty on imports via Hudson's Bay which were
F17 1630 13    viewed as aimed at the "very vitals of the Company's
F17 1640 10    trade and power". To reduce further the flow of goods
F17 1650  8    from England, the Company's local officials asked that
F17 1660  5    its London authorities refrain from forwarding any
F17 1670  2    more trade goods to these men.
F17 1670  8       With their customary source of supply cut off, the
F17 1680  6    Fort Garry free traders engaged three men to cart goods
F17 1690  4    to them from the Mississippi country. Others carried
F17 1700  1    pemmican from "the Forks" to St& Paul and goods from
F17 1700 11    St& Paul to Red River, as in the summer of 1847 when
F17 1710 12    one trader, Wells, transported twenty barrels of whisky
F17 1720  6    to the British settlement. This trade was subject to
F17 1730  5    a tariff of 7.5 per cent after February 1835, but much
F17 1740  3    was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the
F17 1740 12    duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative
F17 1750 12    of the London committee.
F17 1760  1       The trade in a few commodities noted above was to
F17 1760 11    grow in volume as a result of changes both north and
F17 1770 11    south of the 49th parallel.
F18 0010  1    The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor.
F18 0010 11    Indeed, no richer humor is to be found in the whole
F18 0020  9    of American literature than in the letters of the semi-literate
F18 0030  7    men who wore the blue and the gray. Some of their figures
F18 0040  4    of speech were colorful and expressive. A Confederate
F18 0050  1    observed that the Yankees were: "thicker than lise
F18 0050  9    on a hen and a dam site ornraier". Another reported
F18 0060  8    that his comrades were "in fine spirits pitching around
F18 0070  6    like a blind dog in a meat house". A third wrote that
F18 0080  5    it was "raining like poring peas on a rawhide".
F18 0090  1       Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression.
F18 0090  8    One wrote: "[I am so hungry] I could eat a rider off
F18 0100 12    his horse + snap at the stirups". A second reported
F18 0110  8    that the dilapidated houses in Virginia "look like
F18 0120  5    the latter end of original sin and hard times". A third
F18 0130  3    remarked of slowness of Southerners: "They moved about
F18 0140  2    from corner to corner, as uneasy as a litter of hungry
F18 0140 13    leaches on the neck of a wooden god". Still another,
F18 0150 10    annoyed by the brevity of a recently received missive,
F18 0160  6    wrote: "Yore letter was short and sweet, jist like
F18 0170  4    a roasted maget". A Yankee sergeant gave the following
F18 0180  1    description of his sweetheart: "My girl is none of
F18 0180 10    your one-horse girls. She is a regular stub and twister,
F18 0190  9    double geered. **h She is well-educated and refined,
F18 0200  7    all wildcat and fur, and Union from the muzzle to the
F18 0210  5    crupper".
F18 0210  6       Humor found many modes of expression. A Texan wrote
F18 0220  4    to a male companion at home: "What has become of Halda
F18 0230  3    and Laura? **h When you see them again give them my
F18 0240  1    love- not best respects now, but love by God". William
F18 0240 10    R& Stillwell, an admirable Georgian whose delightful
F18 0250  6    correspondence is preserved in the Georgia Department
F18 0260  5    of Archives and History, liked to tease his wife in
F18 0280  5    his letters. After he had been away from home about
F18 0290  1    a year he wrote: "[Dear Wife] If I did not write and
F18 0290 13    receive letters from you I believe that I would forgit
F18 0300 10    that I was married I don't feel much like a maryed
F18 0310  8    man but I never forgit it sofar as to court enny other
F18 0320  6    lady but if I should you must forgive me as I am so
F18 0340  2    forgitful". A Yank, disturbed by his increasing corpulence,
F18 0340 10    wrote: "I am growing so fat **h I am a burden 2 myself".
F18 0350 13    Another Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer:
F18 0360  7    "Now I lay me down to sleep, The gray-backs o'er my
F18 0370  8    body creep; If they should bite before I wake, I pray
F18 0380  6    the Lord their jaws to break"".
F18 0385  1       Charles Thiot, a splendid Georgia soldier, differed
F18 0390  7    from most of his comrades in the ranks in that he was
F18 0400  9    the owner of a large plantation, well-educated, and
F18 0410  4    nearly fifty years of age. But he was very much like
F18 0420  1    his associates in his hatred of camp routine. Near
F18 0420 10    the end of his service he wrote that when the war was
F18 0430  9    over he was going to buy two pups, name one of them
F18 0440  5    "fall-in" and the other "close-up", and then shoot
F18 0450  3    them both, "and that will be the end of 'fall-in' and
F18 0460  1    'close-up'".
F18 0460  3       The soldiers who comprised the rank and file of
F18 0470  2    the Civil War armies were an earthy people. They talked
F18 0470 12    and wrote much about the elemental functions of the
F18 0480  9    body. One of the most common of camp maladies was diarrhoea.
F18 0490  7    Men of more delicate sensibilities referred to this
F18 0500  4    condition as "looseness of the bowels"; but a much
F18 0510  3    more common designation was "the sh-ts". A Michigan
F18 0510 12    soldier stationed in Georgia wrote in 1864: "I expect
F18 0520  9    to be tough as a knott as soon as I get over the Georgia
F18 0530 12    Shitts". Johnny Rebs from the deep South who were plagued
F18 0540  8    with diarrhoea after transfer to the Virginia front
F18 0550  5    often informed their families that they were suffering
F18 0560  1    from the "the Virginia quickstep".
F18 0560  6       A Georgia soldier gave his wife the following description
F18 0570  7    of the cause and consequence of diarrhoea: "I have
F18 0580  5    bin a little sick with diorah two or three days **h.
F18 0590  3    I eat too much eggs and poark it sowered [on] my stomack
F18 0600  1    and turn loose on me". A Michigan soldier wrote his
F18 0600 11    brother: "I am well at present with the exception I
F18 0610 10    have got the Dyerear and I hope thease few lines find
F18 0620  8    you the same".
F18 0620 11       The letters which poured forth from camps were usually
F18 0630  8    written under adverse circumstances. Save for brief
F18 0640  4    periods in garrison or winter quarters, soldiers rarely
F18 0650  2    enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table. Most
F18 0650 12    of the letters were written in the hubbub of camp,
F18 0660 10    on stumps, pieces of bark, drum heads, or the knee.
F18 0670  7    In the South, after the first year of the war, paper
F18 0680  4    and ink were very poor. Scarcity of paper caused many
F18 0690  1    Southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing,
F18 0690  9    i&e&, after writing from left to right of the page
F18 0700  8    in the usual manner, they gave the sheet a half turn
F18 0710  5    and wrote from end to end across the lines previously
F18 0720  1    written. Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets
F18 0720  8    were whizzing about their heads. A Yank writing from
F18 0730  8    Vicksburg, May 28, 1863, stated "Not less than 50 balls
F18 0740  7    have passed over me since I commenced writing **h.
F18 0750  3    I could tell you of plenty narrow escapes, but we take
F18 0760  2    no notice of them now". A Reb stationed near Petersburg
F18 0760 12    informed his mother: "I need not tell you that I dodge
F18 0770 11    pretty often **h for you can see that very plainly
F18 0780  9    by the blots in this letter. Just count each blot a
F18 0790  5    dodge and add in a few for I don't dodge every time".
F18 0800  2    Another Reb writing under similar circumstances before
F18 0800  9    Atlanta reported: "The Yankees keep Shooting so I am
F18 0810  9    afraid they will knock over my ink, so I will close".
F18 0820 10    #/3,#
F18 0820 11    The most common type of letter was that of soldier
F18 0830  9    husbands to their wives. But fathers often addressed
F18 0840  4    communications to their small children; and these,
F18 0850  2    full of homely advice, are among the most human and
F18 0850 12    revealing of Civil War letters. Rebs who owned slaves
F18 0860  9    occasionally would include in their letters admonitions
F18 0870  5    or greetings to members of the Negro community. Occasionally
F18 0880  3    they would write to the slaves. Early in the war it
F18 0890  3    was not uncommon for planters' sons to retain in camp
F18 0890 13    Negro "body servants" to perform the menial chores
F18 0900  8    such as cooking, foraging, cleaning the quarters, shining
F18 0910  5    shoes, and laundering clothes. Sometimes these servants
F18 0920  4    wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters of
F18 0930  2    their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and
F18 0930 10    to members of their owners' families.
F18 0940  5       Unmarried soldiers carried on correspondence with
F18 0950  3    sweethearts at home. Owing to the restrained usages
F18 0960  1    characteristic of 19th-century America, these letters
F18 0960  8    usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth
F18 0970  6    of feeling.
F18 0970  8       Occasionally gay young blades would write vividly
F18 0980  7    to boon companions at home about their amorous exploits
F18 0990  4    in Richmond, Petersburg, Washington, or Nashville.
F18 1000  2    But these comments are hardly printable. An Alabama
F18 1000 10    soldier whose feminine associations were of the more
F18 1020  7    admirable type wrote boastfully of his achievements
F18 1030  4    among the Virginia belles: "They thout I was a saint.
F18 1040  5    I told them some sweet lies and they believed it all
F18 1050  2    **h I would tell them I got a letter from home stating
F18 1050 14    that five of my Negroes had runaway and ten of Pappies
F18 1060 10    But I wold say I recond he did not mind it for he had
F18 1070 10    a plenty more left and then they would lean to me like
F18 1080  6    a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk".
F18 1090  1       Some of the letters were pungently expressive. An
F18 1090  8    Ohio soldier who, from a comrade just returned from
F18 1100  7    leave, received an unfavorable comment on the conduct
F18 1110  4    of his sister, took pen in hand and delivered himself
F18 1120  1    thus: "[Dear Sis] Alf sed he heard that you and hardy
F18 1120 12    was a runing together all the time and he though he
F18 1130 11    wod gust quit having any thing mor to doo with you
F18 1140  8    for he thought it was no more yuse **h. I think you
F18 1150  4    made a dam good chouise to turn off as nise a feler
F18 1150 16    as Alf dyer and let that orney thefin, drunkard, damed
F18 1160  9    card playing Sun of a bich com to Sea you, the god
F18 1170 10    damed theaf and lop yeard pigen tode helion, he is
F18 1180  4    too orney for hel **h. i will Shute him as shore as
F18 1190  1    i Sea him".
F18 1190  4       Initiation into combat sometimes elicited from soldier
F18 1200  2    correspondents choice comments about their experiences
F18 1200  8    and reactions. A Federal infantryman wrote to his father
F18 1210  8    shortly after his first skirmish in Virginia: "Dear
F18 1220  6    Pa **h. Went out a Skouting yesterday. We got to one
F18 1230  6    house where there were five secessionist they brok
F18 1240  2    + run and Arch holored out to shoot the ornery suns
F18 1240 13    of biches and we all let go at them. Thay may say what
F18 1250 12    they please but godamit Pa it is fun".
F18 1260  5       Some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers in
F18 1270  2    their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers.
F18 1270 10    A Mississippi soldier wrote: "Our General Reub Davis
F18 1280  7    **h is a vain, stuck-up, illiterate ass". An Alabamian
F18 1290  7    wrote: "Col& Henry is [an ignoramus] fit for nothing
F18 1300  7    higher than the cultivation of corn". A Floridian stated
F18 1310  6    that his officers were "not fit to tote guts to a bear".
F18 1320  6    On December 9, 1862, Sergeant Edwin H& Fay, an unusual
F18 1330  4    Louisianan who held A&B& and M&A& degrees from Harvard
F18 1340  3    University and who before the war was headmaster of
F18 1340 12    a private school for boys in Louisiana, wrote his wife:
F18 1350 10    "I saw Pemberton and he is the most insignificant puke
F18 1360  8    I ever saw **h. His head cannot contain enough sense
F18 1370  5    to command a regiment, much less a corps **h. Jackson
F18 1380  3    **h runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to
F18 1380 13    follow their leader. He is not worth shucks. But he
F18 1390 10    is a West Point graduate and therefore must be born
F18 1400  7    to command".
F18 1400  9       Similar comments about officers are to be found
F18 1410  7    in the letters of Northern soldiers. A Massachusetts
F18 1420  3    soldier, who seems to have been a Civil War version
F18 1430  2    of Bill Mauldin, wrote: "The officers consider themselves
F18 1440  1    as made of a different material from the low fellows
F18 1440 11    in the ranks **h. They get all the glory and most of
F18 1450 10    the pay and don't earn ten cents apiece on the average,
F18 1460  6    the drunken rascals". Private George Gray Hunter of
F18 1470  4    Pennsylvania wrote: "I am well convinced in My own
F18 1480  2    Mind that had it not been for officers this war would
F18 1480 13    have ended long ago". Another Yankee became so disgusted
F18 1490  8    as to state: "I wish to God one half of our officers
F18 1500  9    were knocked in the head by slinging them against [the
F18 1510  4    other half]".
F18 1510  6       No group of officers came in for more spirited denunciation
F18 1520  7    than the doctors. One Federal soldier wrote: "The docters
F18 1530  5    is no a conte **h hell will be filde with do[c]ters
F18 1540  3    and offersey when this war is over". Shortly after
F18 1550  1    the beginning of Sherman's Georgia campaign, an ailing
F18 1550  9    Yank wrote his homefolk: "The surgeon insisted on Sending
F18 1560  9    me to the hospital for treatment. I insisted on takeing
F18 1570  7    the field and prevailed- thinking that I had better
F18 1580  8    die by rebel bullets than [by] Union quackery".
F18 1590  2       The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward
F18 1600  1    each other were very much the same and ranged over
F18 1600 11    the same gamut of feeling, from friendliness to extreme
F18 1610  7    hatred. The Rebs were, to a Massachusetts corporal,
F18 1620  4    "fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey + gunpowder
F18 1630  3    put into a human frame". A Pennsylvania soldier wrote
F18 1640  2    that "they were the hardest looking set of men that
F18 1640 12    Ever i saw they Looked as if they had been fed on vinegar
F18 1650 11    and shavings **h". Private Jenkins Lloyd Jones of the
F18 1660  7    Wisconsin Light Artillery wrote in his diary: "I strolled
F18 1670  6    among the Alabamans on the right **h found some of
F18 1680  5    the greenest specimens of humanity I think in the universe
F18 1690  1    their ignorance being little less than the slave they
F18 1690 10    despise with as imperfect a dialect 'They Recooned
F18 1700  8    as how you'uns all would be a heap wus to we'uns all'".
F18 1710  8    In a similar vein, but writing from the opposite side,
F18 1720  5    Thomas Taylor, a private in the 6th Alabama Volunteers,
F18 1730  2    in a letter to his wife, stated: "You know that my
F18 1740  2    heart is with you but I never could have been satisfied
F18 1740 13    to have staid at home when my country is invaded by
F18 1750  9    a thievin foe By a set of cowardly Skunks whose Motto
F18 1760  5    is Booty **h.
F19 0010  1    THE POPULARITY OF FOLKLORE IN AMERICA STANDS IN DIRECT
F19 0010 10    PROPORTION to the popularity of nationalism in America.
F19 0020  8    And the emphasis on nationalism in America is in proportion
F19 0030  6    to the growth of American influence across the world.
F19 0040  4    Thus, if we are to observe American folklore in the
F19 0050  3    twentieth century, we will do well to establish the
F19 0050 12    relationships between folklore, nationalism and imperialism
F19 0060  6    at the outset.
F19 0070  1       Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts
F19 0070  9    concerning nationalism and international influence.
F19 0080  4    1) Every age rewrites the events of its history in
F19 0090  5    terms of what should have been, creating legends about
F19 0100  2    itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse
F19 0100  9    contemporary actions. What actually occurred in the
F19 0110  7    past is seldom as important as what a given generation
F19 0120  6    feels must have occurred. 2) As a country superimposes
F19 0130  2    its cultural and political attitudes on others, it
F19 0130 10    searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness.
F19 0140  9    Its folklore and legend, usually disguised as history,
F19 0150  7    are allowed to account for group actions, to provide
F19 0160  6    a focal point for group loyalty, and to become a cohesive
F19 0170  4    force for national identification.
F19 0170  8       One can apply these facts to Britain in the late
F19 0180  8    eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her
F19 0190  5    dominion over palm and pine, and they can be applied
F19 0200  2    again to the United States in more recent years. The
F19 0200 12    popularity of local color literature before the Spanish-American
F19 0210  9    War, the steady currency of the Lincoln myth, the increased
F19 0220  9    emphasis on the frontier west in our mass media are
F19 0230  8    cases in point. Nor is it an accident that baseball,
F19 0240  3    growing into the national game in the last 75 years,
F19 0250  1    has become a microcosm of American life, that learned
F19 0250 10    societies such as the American Folklore Society and
F19 0260  7    the American Historical Association were founded in
F19 0270  5    the 1880s, or that courses in American literature,
F19 0280  1    American civilization, American anything have swept
F19 0280  7    our school and college curricula.
F19 0290  4       Of course, nationalism has really outlived its usefulness
F19 0300  4    in a country as world-oriented as ours, and its continued
F19 0310  2    existence reflects one of the major culture lags of
F19 0310 11    the twentieth-century United States. Yet nationalism
F19 0320  5    has lost few of its charms for the historian, writer
F19 0330  6    or man in the street. It is an understandable paradox
F19 0340  2    that most American history and most American literature
F19 0350  1    is today written from an essentially egocentric and
F19 0350  9    isolationistic point of view at the very time America
F19 0360  9    is spreading her dominion over palm and pine. After
F19 0370  6    all, the average American as he lies and waits for
F19 0380  3    the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in
F19 0380 14    some vain hope of personal contact with the front is
F19 0390  9    unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of
F19 0400  7    a complex of personal, economic and governmental actions
F19 0410  2    far beyond the normal citizen's comprehension and control.
F19 0420  1    Anyone's identification with an international struggle,
F19 0420  7    whether warlike or peaceful, requires absurd oversimplification
F19 0430  7    and intense emotional involvement. Such identification
F19 0440  5    comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history
F19 0450  5    into legend and developing appropriate national heroes.
F19 0460  3       In America, such self-deception has served a particularly
F19 0470  3    useful purpose. A heterogeneous people have needed
F19 0470 10    it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion
F19 0480 10    in a new and ever-changing land. But we must never
F19 0490  6    forget, most of the appropriate heroes and their legends
F19 0500  5    were created overnight, to answer immediate needs,
F19 0510  1    almost always with conscious aims and ends. Parson
F19 0510  9    Weems's George Washington became the symbol of honesty
F19 0520  7    and the father image of the uniting States. Abraham
F19 0530  5    Lincoln emerged as an incarnation of the national Constitution.
F19 0540  4    Robert E& Lee represented the dignity needed by a rebelling
F19 0550  5    confederacy. And their roles are paralleled by those
F19 0560  2    of Patrick Henry, Nathan Hale, Andrew Jackson, Davy
F19 0560 10    Crockett, Theodore Roosevelt and many, many more.
F19 0570  7       Therefore, the scholar, as he looks at our national
F19 0580  8    folklore of the last 60 years, will be mindful of two
F19 0590  6    facts. 1) Most of the legends that are created to fan
F19 0600  3    the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic
F19 0600 10    and are not folk legends at all. 2) The concept that
F19 0610 10    an "American national folklore" exists is itself probably
F19 0620  6    another propagandistic legend.
F19 0630  1       Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous
F19 0630  9    group of people preserve, vary and recreate through
F19 0640  8    oral transmission. It has come to mean myths, legends,
F19 0650  7    tales, songs, proverbs, riddles, superstitions, rhymes
F19 0660  2    and such literary forms of expression. Related to written
F19 0670  2    literature, and often remaining temporarily frozen
F19 0670  8    in written form, it loses its vitality when transcribed
F19 0680  8    or removed from its oral existence. Though it may exist
F19 0690  6    in either literate or illiterate societies, it assumes
F19 0700  3    a role of true cultural importance only in the latter.
F19 0710  1       In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover
F19 0710  9    our folk heritage, the public has remained ignorant
F19 0720  8    of definitions such as this. Enthusiastically, Americans
F19 0730  4    have swept subliterary and bogus materials like Paul
F19 0740  4    Bunyan tales, Abe Lincoln anecdotes and labor union
F19 0750  2    songs up as true products of our American oral tradition.
F19 0750 12    Nor have we remembered that in the melting pot of America
F19 0760 11    the hundreds of isolated and semi-isolated ethnic,
F19 0770  6    regional and occupational groups did not fuse into
F19 0780  4    a homogeneous national unit until long after education
F19 0785  1    and industrialization had caused them to cast oral
F19 0790  7    tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant
F19 0800  7    material.
F19 0800  8       Naturally, such scholarly facts are of little concern
F19 0810  8    to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by
F19 0820  6    means of folklore. That much of what he calls folklore
F19 0830  3    is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people
F19 0840  1    with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass
F19 0840 10    emotional reaction to a particular situation or set
F19 0850  7    of situations is irrelevant. As long as his material
F19 0860  4    is Americana, can in some way be ascribed to the masses
F19 0870  1    and appears "democratic" to his audience, he remains
F19 0870  9    satisfied.
F19 0880  1       From all this we can now see that two streams of
F19 0880 12    development run through the history of twentieth-century
F19 0890  8    American folklore. On the one side we have the university
F19 0900  8    professors and their students, trained in Teutonic
F19 0910  3    methods of research, who have sought out, collected
F19 0920  1    and studied the true products of the oral traditions
F19 0920 10    of the ethnic, regional and occupational groups that
F19 0930  6    make up this nation. On the other we have the flag-wavers
F19 0940  6    and the national sentimentalists who have been willing
F19 0950  2    to use any patriotic, "frontier western" or colonial
F19 0950 10    material willy-nilly. Unfortunately, few of the artists
F19 0960  8    (writers, movie producers, dramatists and musicians)
F19 0970  5    who have used American folklore since 1900 have known
F19 0980  5    enough to distinguish between the two streams even
F19 0990  2    in the most general of ways. After all, the field is
F19 0990 13    large, difficult to define and seldom taught properly
F19 1000  7    to American undergraduates. In addition, this country
F19 1010  5    has been settled by many peoples of many heritages
F19 1020  2    and their lore has become acculturated slowly, in an
F19 1020 11    age of print and easy communication, within an ever-expanding
F19 1030  9    and changing society. The problems confuse even the
F19 1040  6    experts.
F19 1040  7       For that matter, the experts themselves are a mixed
F19 1050  7    breed. Anthropologists, housewives, historians and
F19 1060  3    such by profession, they approach their discipline
F19 1070  1    as amateurs, collectors, commercial propagandists,
F19 1070  6    analysts or some combination of the four. They have
F19 1080  6    widely varying backgrounds and aims. They have little
F19 1090  4    "esprit de corps".
F19 1090  7       The outlook for the amateur, for instance, is usually
F19 1100  6    dependent on his fondness for local history or for
F19 1110  4    the picturesque. His love of folklore has romanticism
F19 1120  1    in it, and he doesn't care much about the dollar-sign
F19 1120 12    or the footnote. Folklore is his hobby, and he, all
F19 1130  8    too rightly, wishes it to remain as such. The amateur
F19 1140  5    is closely related to the collector, who is actually
F19 1150  2    no more than the amateur who has taken to the field.
F19 1150 13    The collector enjoys the contact with rural life; he
F19 1160  8    hunts folklore for the very "field and stream" reasons
F19 1170  6    that many persons hunt game; and only rarely is he
F19 1180  5    acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located.
F19 1190  2    Fundamentally, both these types, the amateur and the
F19 1190 10    collector, are uncritical and many of them don't distinguish
F19 1200  9    well between real folklore and bogus material.
F19 1210  6       But there are also the commercial propagandists
F19 1220  2    and the analysts- one dominated by money, the other
F19 1230  1    by nineteenth-century German scholarship. Both are
F19 1230  8    primarily concerned with the uses that can be made
F19 1240  8    of the material that the collector has found. Both
F19 1250  4    shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond
F19 1260  1    the sewage system and the electric light lines. The
F19 1260 10    commercial propagandist, who can't afford to be critical,
F19 1270  7    gets along well with the amateur, from whom he feeds,
F19 1280  6    but he frequently steps on the analyst's toes by refusing
F19 1290  4    to keep his material genuine. His standards are, of
F19 1300  2    course, completely foreign to those of the analyst.
F19 1300 10    To both the amateur and the commercial progandist the
F19 1310  6    analyst lacks a soul, lacks appreciation with his endless
F19 1320  4    probings and classifications. Dominated by the vicious
F19 1330  3    circle of the university promotion system, the analyst
F19 1330 11    looks down on and gets along poorly with the other
F19 1340 10    three groups, although he cannot deny his debt to the
F19 1350  8    collector.
F19 1350  9       The knowledge that most Americans have of folklore
F19 1360  6    comes through contact with commercial propagandists
F19 1370  2    and a few energetic amateurs and collectors. The work
F19 1380  1    done by the analysts, the men who really know what
F19 1380 11    folklore is all about, has no more appeal than any
F19 1390  7    other work of a truly scientific sort and reaches a
F19 1400  4    limited, learned audience. Publishers want books that
F19 1410  1    will sell, recording studios want discs that will not
F19 1410 10    seem strange to ears used to hillbilly and jazz music,
F19 1420  8    grade and high schools want quaint, but moral, material.
F19 1430  4    The analyst is apt to be too honest to fit in. As a
F19 1440  4    result, most people don't have more than a vague idea
F19 1440 14    what folklore actually is; they see it as a potpourri
F19 1450 10    of charming, moral legends and patriotic anecdotes,
F19 1460  5    with a superstition or remedy thrown in here and there.
F19 1470  5    And so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur
F19 1480  1    and the money-maker that even at the college level
F19 1480 11    most of the hundred-odd folklore courses given in the
F19 1490  8    United States survive on sentiment and nationalism
F19 1500  3    alone.
F19 1500  4       If one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses
F19 1510  4    folklore in his work, the first thing he must realize
F19 1520  1    is that the literary figure is probably part of this
F19 1520 11    ignorant American public. And while every writer must
F19 1530  7    be dealt with as a special case, the interested student
F19 1540  5    will want to ask himself a number of questions about
F19 1550  2    each. Does the writer know the difference between an
F19 1550 11    "ersatz" ballad or tall tale and a true product of
F19 1560 10    the folk? When the writer uses material does he tamper
F19 1570  8    with it to improve its commercial effect or does he
F19 1580  5    leave it pure? Is the writer propagandistic? Is he
F19 1590  3    swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an America
F19 1590 12    that was? Or does he sincerely want to tap the real
F19 1600 10    springs of American attitude and culture regardless
F19 1610  5    of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be?
F19 1620  3       When he gets the answers to his questions he will
F19 1620 13    be discouraged. In the first place, a good many writers
F19 1630 10    who are said to use folklore, do not, unless one counts
F19 1640  8    an occasional superstition or tale. Robert Frost, for
F19 1650  5    instance, writes about rural life in New England, but
F19 1660  2    he does not include any significant amount of folklore
F19 1660 11    in his poems. This has not, however, prevented publishers
F19 1670  9    from labeling him a "folk poet", simply because he
F19 1680  8    is a rural one. In the second place, a large number
F19 1690  5    of writers, making a more direct claim than Frost to
F19 1700  2    being "folk writers" of one sort or another, clearly
F19 1700 11    make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material.
F19 1710  8    Stephen Vincent Benet's John Brown's Body comes immediately
F19 1720  7    to mind in this connection, as does John Steinbeck's
F19 1730  6    The Grapes of Wrath and Carl Sandburg's The People,
F19 1740  6    Yes. The last two writers introduce strong political
F19 1760  4    bias into their works, and not unlike the union leaders
F19 1770  2    that we will discuss soon, see folklore as a reservoir
F19 1770 12    of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced
F19 1780  8    mass. Folklore, as used by such writers, really reflects
F19 1790  7    images engraved into it by the very person using it.
F19 1800  4    The folk are simply not homogeneous with respect to
F19 1810  2    nation or political attitude. In fact, there is much
F19 1810 11    evidence to indicate they don't care a bit about anything
F19 1820  9    beyond their particular regional, ethnic and occupational
F19 1830  5    limits. Nevertheless, with a reading public that longs
F19 1840  4    for the "good old days" and with an awareness of our
F19 1850  3    expanding international interests, it is easy for the
F19 1850 11    Benets to obtain a magnified position in literature
F19 1860  8    by use of all sorts of Americana, real or fake, and
F19 1870  6    it is easy for the Steinbecks and Sandburgs to support
F19 1880  3    their messages of reform by reading messages of reform
F19 1890  1    into the minds of the folk.
F20 0010  1    As part of the same arrangement, Torrio had, in the
F20 0010 11    spirit of peace and good will, and in exchange for
F20 0020  8    armed support in the April election campaign, bestowed
F20 0030  3    upon O'Banion a third share in the Hawthorne Smoke
F20 0040  2    Shop proceeds and a cut in the Cicero beer trade. The
F20 0040 13    coalition was to prove inadvisable.
F20 0050  5       O'Banion was a complex and frightening man, whose
F20 0060  3    bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour
F20 0070  1    into others'. He had a round, frank Irish face, creased
F20 0070 11    in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even
F20 0080  9    when he was pumping bullets into someone's body. He
F20 0090  5    carried three guns- one in the right trouser pocket,
F20 0100  3    one under his left armpit, one in the left outside
F20 0100 13    coat pocket- and was equally lethal with both hands.
F20 0110  8    He killed accurately, freely, and dispassionately.
F20 0120  4    The police credited him with twenty-five murders but
F20 0130  3    he was never brought to trial for one of them. Like
F20 0140  2    a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol. He
F20 0140 11    was an expert florist, tenderly dextrous in the arrangement
F20 0150  7    of bouquets and wreaths. He had no apparent comprehension
F20 0160  6    of morality; he divided humanity into "right guys"
F20 0170  4    and "wrong guys", and the wrong ones he was always
F20 0180  3    willing to kill and trample under. He had what was
F20 0180 13    described by a psychologist as a "sunny brutality".
F20 0190  8    He walked with a heavy list to the right, as that leg
F20 0200  8    was four inches shorter than the other, but the lurch
F20 0210  4    did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns.
F20 0210 13    Landesco thought him "just a superior sort of plugugly"
F20 0220  9    but he was, in fact, with his aggression and hostility,
F20 0230  8    and nerveless indifference to risking or administering
F20 0240  5    pain, a casebook psychopath. He was also at this time,
F20 0250  4    although not so interwoven in high politics and the
F20 0250 13    rackets as Torrio and Capone, the most powerful and
F20 0260  9    most dangerous mob leader in the Chicago underworld,
F20 0270  6    the roughneck king.
F20 0270  9       O'Banion was born in poverty, the son of an immigrant
F20 0280 10    Irish plasterer, in the North Side's Little Hell, close
F20 0290  8    by the Sicilian quarter and Death Corner. He had been
F20 0300  7    a choir boy at the Holy Name Cathedral and also served
F20 0310  4    as an acolyte to Father O'Brien. The influence of Mass
F20 0320  3    was less pervasive than that of the congested, slum
F20 0320 12    tenements among the bawdy houses, honkytonks, and sawdust
F20 0330  8    saloons of his birthplace; he ran wild with the child
F20 0340  7    gangs of the neighbourhood, and went through the normal
F20 0350  5    pressure-cooker course of thieving, police-dodging,
F20 0360  1    and housebreaking. At the age of ten, when he was working
F20 0360 12    as a newsboy in the Loop, he was knocked down by a
F20 0370 12    streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened
F20 0380  5    leg. Because of this he was known as Gimpy (but, as
F20 0390  4    with Capone and his nickname of Scarface, never in
F20 0400  1    his presence). In his teens O'Banion was enrolled in
F20 0400 10    the vicious Market Street gang and he became a singing
F20 0410  9    waiter in McGovern's Cafe, a notoriously low and rowdy
F20 0420  7    dive in North Clark Street, where befuddled customers
F20 0430  3    were methodically looted of their money by the singing
F20 0440  1    waiters before being thrown out. He then got a job
F20 0440 11    with the Chicago Herald-Examiner as a circulation slugger,
F20 0450  7    a rough fighter employed to see that his paper's news
F20 0460  8    pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors.
F20 0470  4    He was also at the same time gaining practical experience
F20 0480  2    as a safe breaker and highwayman, and learning how
F20 0480 11    to shoot to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer
F20 0490  8    named Gene Geary, later committed to Chester Asylum
F20 0500  5    as a homicidal maniac, but whose eyes misted with tears
F20 0510  4    when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish mother
F20 0520  2    in his clear and syrupy tenor.
F20 0520  8       O'Banion's first conflict with the police came in
F20 0530  6    1909, at seventeen, when he was committed to Bridewell
F20 0540  3    Prison for three months for burglary; two years later
F20 0550  2    he served another three months for assault. Those were
F20 0550 11    his only interludes behind bars, although he collected
F20 0560  7    four more charges on his police record in 1921 and
F20 0570  6    1922, three for burglary and one for robbery. But by
F20 0580  3    now O'Banion's political pull was beginning to be effective.
F20 0590  1    On the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $10,000
F20 0590 10    bond was furnished by an alderman, and the charge was
F20 0600  9    nolle prossed. On one of his 1921 ventures he was actually
F20 0610  8    come upon by a Detective Sergeant John J& Ryan down
F20 0620  5    on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour office
F20 0630  2    safe in the Postal Telegraph Building; the jury wanted
F20 0640  1    better evidence than that and he was acquitted, at
F20 0640 10    a cost of $30,000 in bribes, it was estimated. As promptly
F20 0650  8    as Torrio, O'Banion jumped into bootlegging. He conducted
F20 0660  5    it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence
F20 0670  2    than the Sicilians, but he had his huge North Side
F20 0680  1    portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money.
F20 0680 12    Unlike the Sicilians, he additionally conducted holdups,
F20 0690  6    robberies, and safe-cracking expeditions, and refused
F20 0700  4    to touch prostitution. He was also personally active
F20 0710  2    in ward politics, and by 1924 O'Banion had acquired
F20 0720  1    sufficient political might to be able to state: "I
F20 0720 10    always deliver my borough as per requirements".
F20 0730  6       But whose requirements? Until 1924 O'Banion pistoleers
F20 0740  5    and knuckle-duster bullyboys had kept his North Side
F20 0750  5    domain solidly Democratic. There was a question-and-answer
F20 0760  1    gag that went around at that time: Q& "Who'll carry
F20 0770  2    the Forty-second and Forty-third wards"? A& "O'Banion,
F20 0780  1    in his pistol pocket". But as November 1924 drew close
F20 0780 11    the Democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine
F20 0790  6    reports that O'Banion was being wooed by the opposition,
F20 0810  7    and was meeting and conferring with important Republicans.
F20 0820  4    To forestall any change of allegiance, the Democrats
F20 0830  3    hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O'Banion,
F20 0840  1    as public reward for his past services and as a reminder
F20 0840 12    of where his loyalties lay.
F20 0850  4       The reception was held in a private dining room
F20 0860  2    of the Webster Hotel on Lincoln Park West. It was an
F20 0860 13    interesting fraternisation of ex-convicts, union racketeers,
F20 0870  7    ward heelers, sold-out officials, and gunmen. The guest
F20 0880  8    list is in itself a little parable of the state of
F20 0890  6    American civic life at this time. It included the top
F20 0900  3    O'Banion men and Chief of Detectives Michael Hughes.
F20 0910  1       When Mayor Dever heard of the banquet he summoned
F20 0910 10    Hughes for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring
F20 0920 10    the police department by consorting with these felons
F20 0930  6    and fixers. Hughes said that he had understood the
F20 0940  3    party was to be in honour of Jerry O'Connor, the proprieter
F20 0950  2    of a Loop gambling house. "But when I arrived and recognised
F20 0960  1    a number of notorious characters I had thrown into
F20 0960 10    the detective bureau basement half a dozen times, I
F20 0970  8    knew I had been framed, and withdrew almost at once".
F20 0980  5       In fact, O'Connor was honoured during the ceremony
F20 0990  4    with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin.
F20 1000  1    There was a brief interruption while one of O'Banion's
F20 1000 10    men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot
F20 1010 10    a waiter who was pestering him for a tip. Then O'Banion
F20 1020  7    was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies
F20 1030  5    and diamonds.
F20 1030  7       This dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the
F20 1040  7    relationship between the gangs and the politicians,
F20 1050  1    which, prior to 1924, says Pasley, "had been maintained
F20 1050 10    with more or less stealth", but which henceforth was
F20 1060  9    marked by these ostentatious gatherings, denounced
F20 1070  3    by a clergyman as "Belshazzar feasts", at which "politicians
F20 1080  4    fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters, openly, in
F20 1090  3    the big downtown hotels". Pasley continued: "They became
F20 1100  2    an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the
F20 1100 11    way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal
F20 1110  8    and county governments in 1928-29".
F20 1120  4       However, this inaugural feast did its sponsors no
F20 1130  2    good whatever. O'Banion accepted his platinum watch
F20 1130  9    and the tributes to his loyalty, and proceeded with
F20 1140  7    the bigger and better Republican deal. On Election
F20 1150  4    Day- November 4- he energetically marshalled his force
F20 1160  3    of bludgeon men, bribers, and experts in forging repeat
F20 1170  1    votes. The result was a landslide for the Republican
F20 1170 10    candidates.
F20 1180  1       This further demonstration of O'Banion's ballooning
F20 1180  7    power did not please Torrio and Capone. In the past
F20 1190 10    year there had been too many examples of his euphoric
F20 1200  7    self-confidence and self-aggrandisement for their liking.
F20 1210  4    He behaved publicly with a cocky, swaggering truculence
F20 1220  1    that offended their vulpine Latin minds, and behaved
F20 1220  9    towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence
F20 1230  7    that enraged them beneath their blandness. They were
F20 1240  5    disturbed by his idiotic bravado- as, when his bodyguard,
F20 1250  4    Yankee Schwartz, complained that he had been snubbed
F20 1260  1    by Dave Miller, a prize-fight referee, chieftain of
F20 1260 10    a Jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation,
F20 1270 10    who were Hirschey, a gambler-politician in loose beer-running
F20 1280  8    league with Torrio and O'Banion, Frank, a policeman,
F20 1290  4    and Max, the youngest. To settle this slight, O'Banion
F20 1300  3    went down to the La Salle Theatre in the Loop, where,
F20 1310  2    he had learned, Dave Miller was attending the opening
F20 1310 11    of a musical comedy. At the end of the performance,
F20 1320 10    Dave and Max came out into the brilliantly lit foyer
F20 1330  7    among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first nighters.
F20 1340  3    O'Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave, severely
F20 1350  1    wounding him in the stomach. A second bullet ricocheted
F20 1350 10    off Max's belt buckle, leaving him unhurt but in some
F20 1370  9    distress. O'Banion tucked away his gun and walked out
F20 1380  8    of the theatre; he was neither prosecuted nor even
F20 1390  4    arrested. That sort of braggadocio, for that sort of
F20 1400  2    reason, in the view of Torrio and Capone, was a nonsense.
F20 1410  1       A further example of the incompatible difference
F20 1410  7    in personalities was when two policemen held up a Torrio
F20 1420  8    beer convoy on a West Side street and demanded $300
F20 1430  4    to let it through. One of the beer-runners telephoned
F20 1440  1    O'Banion- on a line tapped by the detective bureau-
F20 1440  9    and reported the situation. O'Banion's reaction was:
F20 1450  7    "Three hundred dollars! To them bums? Why, I can get
F20 1460  9    them knocked off for half that much". Upon which the
F20 1470  7    detective bureau despatched rifle squads to prevent
F20 1480  4    trouble if O'Banion should send his gunmen out to deal
F20 1490  3    with the hijacking policemen. But in the meantime the
F20 1490 12    beer-runner, unhappy with this solution, telephoned
F20 1500  6    Torrio and returned to O'Banion with the message: "Say,
F20 1510  6    Dionie, I just been talking to Johnny, and he said
F20 1520  6    to let them cops have the three hundred. He says he
F20 1530  3    don't want no trouble".
F20 1530  7       But Torrio and Capone had graver cause to hate and
F20 1540  6    distrust the Irishman. For three years, since the liquor
F20 1550  4    territorial conference, Torrio had, with his elastic
F20 1560  1    patience, and because he knew that retaliation could
F20 1560  9    cause only violent warfare and disaster to business,
F20 1570  6    tolerated O'Banion's impudent double-crossing. They
F20 1580  4    had suffered, in sulky silence, the sight of his sharp
F20 1590  3    practice in Cicero.
F20 1590  6       When, as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment
F20 1600  6    for the loan of gunmen in the April election, Torrio
F20 1610  2    had given O'Banion a slice of Cicero, the profits from
F20 1620  1    that district had been $20,000 a month. In six months
F20 1620 11    O'Banion had boosted the profits to $100,000 a month-
F20 1630  8    mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago
F20 1640  6    speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb.
F20 1650  2    These booze customers had until then been buying their
F20 1650 11    supplies from the Sheldon, Saltis-McErlane, and Druggan-Lake
F20 1660  9    gangs, and now they were competing for trade with the
F20 1670 10    Torrio-Capone saloons; once again O'Banion's brash
F20 1680  5    recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill will.
F20 1690  4    The revenue from O'Banion's Cicero territory went up
F20 1700  3    still higher, until the yield was more than the Torrio-Capone
F20 1710  1    takings from the far bigger trade area of Chicago's
F20 1710 10    South and West Sides. But he still showed no intention
F20 1720  9    of sharing with the syndicate. At last, even the controlled
F20 1730  7    Torrio was unable to hold still, and he tentatively
F20 1740  4    suggested that O'Banion should take a percentage in
F20 1750  2    the Stickney brothels in return for one from his Cicero
F20 1750 12    beer concession. O'Banion's reply was a raucous laugh
F20 1760  8    and a flat refusal.
F20 1770  1       Still more jealous bitterness was engendered by
F20 1770  8    the O'Banion gang's seizure from a West Side marshalling
F20 1780  8    yard of a freight-car load of Canadian whisky worth
F20 1790  6    $100,000 and by one of the biggest coups of the Prohibition
F20 1800  5    era- the Sibley warehouse robbery, which became famous
F20 1810  4    for the cool brazenness of the operation. Here was
F20 1820  1    stored $1,000,000 worth of bonded whisky. These 1750
F20 1820  9    cases were carted off in a one-night operation by the
F20 1830  9    O'Banion men, who left in their stead the same number
F20 1840  6    of barrels filled with water.
F21 0010  1       A tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide,
F21 0010 11    an earthquake or a volcanic eruption. The most infamous
F21 0020  8    of all was launched by the explosion of the island
F21 0030  5    of Krakatoa in 1883; it raced across the Pacific at
F21 0040  2    300 miles an hour, devastated the coasts of Java and
F21 0040 12    Sumatra with waves 100 to 130 feet high, and pounded
F21 0050 10    the shore as far away as San Francisco.
F21 0060  4       The ancient Greeks recorded several catastrophic
F21 0070  1    inundations by huge waves. Whether or not Plato's tale
F21 0070 10    of the lost continent of Atlantis is true, skeptics
F21 0080  9    concede that the myth may have some foundation in a
F21 0090  7    great tsunami of ancient times. Indeed, a tremendously
F21 0100  3    destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian Sea in
F21 0110  2    1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and
F21 0110 11    archaeologists in the Biblical story of the Flood.
F21 0120  8       One of the most damaging tsunami on record followed
F21 0130  5    the famous Lisbon earthquake of November 1, 1755; its
F21 0140  4    waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away
F21 0150  1    as the English coast. Tsunami are rare, however, in
F21 0150 10    the Atlantic Ocean; they are far more common in the
F21 0160  9    Pacific. Japan has had 15 destructive ones (eight of
F21 0170  5    them disastrous) since 1596. The Hawaiian Islands are
F21 0180  3    struck severely an average of once every 25 years.
F21 0190  1       In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so
F21 0190 10    huge that they piled into the Inland Sea; one wave
F21 0200  7    swamped more than 1,000 ships and boats in Osaka Bay.
F21 0210  5    A tsunami in the Hawaiian Islands in 1869 washed away
F21 0220  3    an entire town (Ponoluu), leaving only two forlorn
F21 0220 11    trees standing where the community had been. In 1896
F21 0230  9    a Japanese tsunami killed 27,000 people and swept away
F21 0240  6    10,000 homes.
F21 0240  8       The dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual
F21 0250  8    standards of measurement. An ordinary sea wave is rarely
F21 0260  5    more than a few hundred feet long from crest to crest-
F21 0270  1    no longer than 320 feet in the Atlantic or 1,000 feet
F21 0270 12    in the Pacific. But a tsunami often extends more than
F21 0280  9    100 miles and sometimes as much as 600 miles from crest
F21 0290  8    to crest. While a wind wave never travels at more than
F21 0300  5    60 miles per hour, the velocity of a tsunami in the
F21 0310  2    open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per
F21 0310 12    hour. The greater the depth of the water, the greater
F21 0320  8    is the speed of the wave; Lagrange's law says that
F21 0330  5    its velocity is equal to the square root of the product
F21 0340  3    of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity.
F21 0340 12    In the deep waters of the Pacific these waves reach
F21 0350 10    a speed of 500 miles per hour.
F21 0360  3       Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their
F21 0360 11    length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable.
F21 0370 10    Their amplitude sometimes is as little as two feet
F21 0380  8    from trough to crest. Usually it is only when they
F21 0390  5    approach shallow water on the shore that they build
F21 0400  1    up to their terrifying heights. On the fateful day
F21 0400 10    in 1896 when the great waves approached Japan, fishermen
F21 0410  6    at sea noticed no unusual swells. Not until they sailed
F21 0420  5    home at the end of the day, through a sea strewn with
F21 0430  3    bodies and the wreckage of houses, were they aware
F21 0430 12    of what had happened. The seemingly quiet ocean had
F21 0440  8    crashed a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon
F21 0450  8    beaches crowded with bathers, drowning thousands of
F21 0460  3    them and flattening villages along the shore.
F21 0460 10       The giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores
F21 0470  9    than on steep ones. They usually range from 20 to 60
F21 0480  7    feet in height, but when they pour into a ~V-shaped
F21 0490  4    inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions.
F21 0500  1       Generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather
F21 0500 11    sharp swell, not different enough from an ordinary
F21 0510  7    wave to alarm casual observers. This is followed by
F21 0520  5    a tremendous suck of water away from the shore as the
F21 0530  3    first great trough arrives. Reefs are left high and
F21 0530 12    dry, and the beaches are covered with stranded fish.
F21 0540  8    At Hilo large numbers of people ran out to inspect
F21 0550  7    the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach. Many of
F21 0560  3    them paid for their curiosity with their lives, for
F21 0560 12    some minutes later the first giant wave roared over
F21 0570  9    the shore. After an earthquake in Japan in 1793 people
F21 0580  6    on the coast at Tugaru were so terrified by the extraordinary
F21 0590  4    ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher ground.
F21 0600  2    When a second quake came, they dashed back to the beach,
F21 0610  1    fearing that they might be buried under landslides.
F21 0610  9    Just as they reached the shore, the first huge wave
F21 0620  7    crashed upon them.
F21 0620 10       A tsunami is not a single wave but a series. The
F21 0630 10    waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an
F21 0640  6    hour or more (because of their great length), and this
F21 0650  3    has often lulled people into thinking after the first
F21 0650 12    great wave has crashed that it is all over. The waves
F21 0660 11    may keep coming for many hours. Usually the third to
F21 0670  6    the eighth waves in the series are the biggest.
F21 0680  2       Among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at Hilo
F21 0680 11    was Francis P& Shepard of the Scripps Institution of
F21 0690  9    Oceanography, one of the world's foremost marine geologists.
F21 0700  8    He was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves.
F21 0710  7    Their onrush and retreat, he reported, was accompanied
F21 0720  3    by a great hissing, roaring and rattling. The third
F21 0730  2    and fourth waves seemed to be the highest. On some
F21 0730 12    of the islands' beaches the waves came in gently; they
F21 0740  8    were steepest on the shores facing the direction of
F21 0750  6    the seaquake from which the waves had come. In Hilo
F21 0760  3    Bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high. The highest
F21 0760 14    waves, 55 feet, occurred at Pololu Valley.
F21 0770  7       Scientists and fishermen have occasionally seen
F21 0780  4    strange by-products of the phenomenon. During a 1933
F21 0790  3    tsunami in Japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night.
F21 0790 12    The luminosity of the water is now believed to have
F21 0800 10    been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the
F21 0810  7    luminescent organism Noctiluca miliaris by the turbulence
F21 0820  4    of the sea. Japanese fishermen have sometimes observed
F21 0830  2    that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami
F21 0830 12    have enormously swollen stomachs; the fish have swallowed
F21 0840  8    vast numbers of bottom-living diatoms, raised to the
F21 0850  8    surface by the disturbance. The waves of a 1923 tsunami
F21 0860  6    in Sagami Bay brought to the surface and battered to
F21 0870  3    death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at
F21 0870 12    a depth of 3,000 feet. Gratified fishermen hauled them
F21 0880  8    in by the thousands.
F21 0890  1       The tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946
F21 0890  9    disaster in Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious
F21 0900  9    instrument devised by Commander C& K& Green of the
F21 0910  8    Coast and Geodetic Survey staff. It consists of a series
F21 0920  6    of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber which record
F21 0930  3    the rise and fall of the water surface. Ordinary water
F21 0940  1    tides are disregarded. But when waves with a period
F21 0940 10    of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the
F21 0950  8    ocean, they set in motion a corresponding oscillation
F21 0960  2    in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit.
F21 0970  1    This in turn sets off an alarm, notifying the observers
F21 0970 11    at the station that a tsunami is in progress. Such
F21 0980  9    equipment has been installed at Hilo, Midway, Attu
F21 0990  5    and Dutch Harbor. The moment the alarm goes off, information
F21 1000  4    is immediately forwarded to Honolulu, which is the
F21 1010  3    center of the warning system.
F21 1010  8       This center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes
F21 1020  5    from four Coast Survey stations in the Pacific which
F21 1030  3    are equipped with seismographs. Its staff makes a preliminary
F21 1040  1    determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts
F21 1040 10    tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami. By
F21 1050  9    means of charts showing wave-travel times and depths
F21 1060  6    in the ocean at various locations, it is possible to
F21 1070  3    estimate the rate of approach and probable time of
F21 1070 12    arrival at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at
F21 1080 10    any spot in the Pacific. The civil and military authorities
F21 1090  6    are then advised of the danger, and they issue warnings
F21 1100  5    and take all necessary protective steps. All of these
F21 1110  3    activities are geared to a top-priority communication
F21 1110 11    system, and practice tests have been held to assure
F21 1120  9    that everything will work smoothly.
F21 1130  2       Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami
F21 1140  1    in the Pacific, but only one was of any consequence.
F21 1140 11    On November 4, 1952, an earthquake occurred under the
F21 1150  7    sea off the Kamchatka Peninsula. At 17:07 that afternoon
F21 1160  5    (Greenwich time) the shock was recorded by the seismograph
F21 1170  4    alarm in Honolulu. The warning system immediately went
F21 1180  2    into action. Within about an hour with the help of
F21 1180 12    reports from seismic stations in Alaska, Arizona and
F21 1190  8    California, the quake's epicenter was placed at 51
F21 1200  6    degrees North latitude and 158 degrees East longitude.
F21 1210  3    While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came
F21 1220  1    in from various points in the Pacific (Midway reported
F21 1220 10    it was covered with nine feet of water), the Hawaiian
F21 1230  8    station made its calculations and notified the military
F21 1240  5    services and the police that the first big wave would
F21 1250  3    arrive at Honolulu at 23:30 Greenwich time.
F21 1250 10       It turned out that the waves were not so high as
F21 1260 11    in 1946. They hurled a cement barge against a freighter
F21 1270  6    in Honolulu Harbor, knocked down telephone lines, marooned
F21 1280  3    automobiles, flooded lawns, killed six cows. But not
F21 1290  3    a single human life was lost, and property damage in
F21 1290 13    the Hawaiian Islands did not exceed $800,000. There
F21 1300  7    is little doubt that the warning system saved lives
F21 1310  5    and reduced the damage.
F21 1310  9       But it is plain that a warning system, however efficient,
F21 1320  8    is not enough. In the vulnerable areas of the Pacific
F21 1330  6    there should be restrictions against building homes
F21 1340  3    on exposed coasts, or at least a requirement that they
F21 1350  1    be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly
F21 1350 10    against waves.
F21 1360  1    ##
F21 1360  2    The key to the world of geology is change; nothing
F21 1360 12    remains the same. Life has evolved from simple combinations
F21 1370  8    of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in
F21 1380  6    man. The land, too, is changing, and earthquakes are
F21 1390  3    daily reminders of this. Earthquakes result when movements
F21 1400  1    in the earth twist rocks until they break. Sometimes
F21 1400 10    this is accompanied by visible shifts of the ground
F21 1410  7    surface; often the shifts cannot be seen, but they
F21 1420  6    are there; and everywhere can be found scars of earlier
F21 1430  3    breaks once deeply buried. Today's earthquakes are
F21 1430 10    most numerous in belts where the earth's restlessness
F21 1440  8    is presently concentrated, but scars of the past show
F21 1450  7    that there is no part of the earth that has not had
F21 1460  5    them.
F21 1460  6       The effects of earthquakes on civilization have
F21 1470  2    been widely publicized, even overemphasized. The role
F21 1470  9    of an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole
F21 1480  9    cities is tremendously frightening, but fire may actually
F21 1490  6    be the principal agent in a particular disaster. Superstition
F21 1500  3    has often blended with fact to color reports.
F21 1510  1       We have learned from earthquakes much of what we
F21 1510 10    now know about the earth's interior, for they send
F21 1520  8    waves through the earth which emerge with information
F21 1530  5    about the materials through which they have traveled.
F21 1540  3    These waves have shown that 1,800 miles below the surface
F21 1550  1    a liquid core begins, and that it, in turn, has a solid
F21 1550 13    inner core.
F21 1560  1       Earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below
F21 1560  9    the surface, but they do not occur at greater depths.
F21 1570  9    Two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts. (1)
F21 1580  6    As far down as 400 miles below the surface the material
F21 1590  3    should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself
F21 1590 13    to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by
F21 1600  9    breaking, as rigid surface rocks do. (2) If earthquakes
F21 1610  6    do occur at such depths, why not deeper?
F21 1620  1       Knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves
F21 1620  7    has been applied in various fields. In the search for
F21 1630  9    oil and gas, we make similar waves under controlled
F21 1640  5    conditions with dynamite and learn from them where
F21 1650  3    there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation
F21 1660  1    of these resources. We have also developed techniques
F21 1660  9    for recognizing and locating underground nuclear tests
F21 1670  6    through the waves in the ground which they generate.
F21 1680  5       The following discussion of this subject has been
F21 1690  3    adapted from the book Causes of Catastrophe by L& Don
F21 1700  3    Leet.
F21 1700  4    #THE RESTLESS EARTH AND ITS INTERIOR#
F21 1700 10    At twelve minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday,
F21 1710  9    April 18, 1906, San Francisco was shaken by a severe
F21 1720  8    earthquake. A sharp tremor was followed by a jerky
F21 1730  6    roll.
F22 0010  1       IN Ireland's County Limerick, near the River Shannon,
F22 0020  2    there is a quiet little suburb by the name of Garryowen,
F22 0020 13    which means "Garden of Owen". Undoubtedly none of the
F22 0030  9    residents realize the influence their town has had
F22 0040  7    on American military history, or the deeds of valor
F22 0050  6    that have been done in its name. The cry "Garryowen"!
F22 0060  1    bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper
F22 0060 10    was the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers
F22 0070 11    of Cheyennes, Sioux and Apaches, Mexican banditos under
F22 0080  7    Pancho Villa, Japanese in the South Pacific, and Chinese
F22 0090  7    and North Korean Communists in Korea. Garryowen is
F22 0100  5    the battle cry of the 7th U& S& Cavalry Regiment, "The
F22 0110  3    Fighting Seventh".
F22 0110  5       Today a battle cry may seem an anachronism, for
F22 0120  7    in the modern Army, esprit de corps has been sacrificed
F22 0130  4    to organizational charts and tables. But don't tell
F22 0140  2    that to a veteran of the Fighting Seventh, especially
F22 0140 11    in a saloon on Saturday night.
F22 0150  5       Of all the thousands of men who have served in the
F22 0160  4    7th Cav, perhaps no one knows its spirit better than
F22 0170  1    Lieutenant Colonel Melbourne C& Chandler. Wiry and
F22 0170  8    burr-headed, with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered
F22 0180  9    with medals, Chandler is the epitome of the old-time
F22 0190  8    trooper. The truth is, however, that when Mel Chandler
F22 0200  4    first reported to the regiment the only steed he had
F22 0210  2    ever ridden was a swivel chair and the only weapon
F22 0220  9    he had ever wielded was a pencil.
F22 0230  4       Chandler had been commissioned in the Medical Service
F22 0240  2    Corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the
F22 0240 12    Kansas City Medical Depot when he decided that if he
F22 0250 10    was going to make the Army his career, he wanted to
F22 0260  8    be in the fighting part of it. Though he knew no more
F22 0270  5    about military science and tactics than any other desk
F22 0280  2    officer, he managed to get transferred to the combat
F22 0280 11    forces. The next thing he knew he was reporting for
F22 0290  9    duty as commanding officer of Troop ~H, 7th Cavalry,
F22 0300  6    in the middle of corps maneuvers in Japan.
F22 0310  1       Outside of combat, he couldn't have landed in a
F22 0310 10    tougher spot. First of all, no unit likes to have a
F22 0320 11    new ~CO brought in from the outside, especially when
F22 0330  5    he's an armchair trooper. Second, if there is ever
F22 0340  5    a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him,
F22 0340 16    it's on maneuvers. In combat, helping your ~CO make
F22 0350  9    a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed.
F22 0360  6    But in maneuvers, with the top brass watching him all
F22 0370  5    the time, it's easy.
F22 0370  9       Chandler understood this and expected the worst.
F22 0380  6    But his first few days with Troop ~H were full of surprises,
F22 0390  6    beginning with First Sergeant Robert Early. Chandler
F22 0400  3    had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice.
F22 0410  1    Instead Sergeant Early was quiet, sharp and confident.
F22 0410  9    He had enlisted in the Army straight out of high school
F22 0420 10    and had immediately set about learning his new trade.
F22 0430  7    There was no weapon Early could not take apart and
F22 0440  4    reassemble blind-folded. He could lead a patrol and
F22 0450  1    he knew his paper work. Further, he had taken full
F22 0450 11    advantage of the Army's correspondence courses. He
F22 0460  4    not only knew soldiering, but mathematics, history
F22 0470  2    and literature as well.
F22 0470  6       But for all his erudite confidence, Sergeant Early
F22 0480  4    was right out of the Garryowen mold. He was filled
F22 0490  4    with the spirit of the Fighting Seventh. That saved
F22 0500  1    Mel Chandler. Sergeant Early let the new ~CO know just
F22 0500 11    how lucky he was to be in the best troop in the best
F22 0510 12    regiment in the United States Army. He fed the captain
F22 0520  7    bits of history about the troops and the regiment.
F22 0530  3    For example, it was a battalion of the 7th Cavalry
F22 0540  1    under Colonel George Armstrong Custer that had been
F22 0540  9    wiped out at the Battle of The Little Big Horn.
F22 0550  7       It didn't take Captain Chandler long to realize
F22 0560  5    that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition on his
F22 0570  3    shoulders as commander of Troop ~H. But what made the
F22 0580  1    load lighter was the realization that every officer,
F22 0580  9    non-com and trooper was ready and willing to help him
F22 0590  8    carry it, for the good of the troop and the regiment.
F22 0600  4       Maneuvers over, the 7th returned to garrison duty
F22 0610  2    in Tokyo, Captain Chandler still with them. It was
F22 0610 11    the 7th Cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding
F22 0620  9    the Imperial Palace of the Emperor. But still Mel Chandler
F22 0630  9    was not completely convinced that men would really
F22 0640  6    die for a four-syllable word, "Garryowen". The final
F22 0650  3    proof was a small incident.
F22 0650  8       It happened at the St& Patrick's Day party, a big
F22 0660  9    affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for
F22 0670  6    over three-quarters of a century to the strains of
F22 0680  2    an Irish march. In the middle of the party Chandler
F22 0680 12    looked up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon
F22 0690 10    him, each beaming above the biggest, greenest shamrock
F22 0700  5    he had ever seen. The faces belonged to Lieutenant
F22 0710  3    Marvin Goulding, his wife and their two children. And
F22 0720  1    when the singing began, it was the Gouldings who sang
F22 0720 11    the old Irish songs the best.
F22 0730  4       Though there was an occasional good-natured chuckle
F22 0740  2    about Marvin Goulding, the Jewish officer from Chicago,
F22 0750  1    singing tearfully about the ould sod, no one really
F22 0750 10    thought it was strange. For Marvin Goulding, like Giovanni
F22 0760  6    Martini, the bugler boy who carried Custer's last message,
F22 0770  6    or Margarito Lopez, the one-man Army on Leyte, was
F22 0780  5    a Garryowen, through and through. It was no coincidence
F22 0800  1    that Goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders
F22 0810  1    in the regiment.
F22 0810  4       And so Mel Chandler got the spirit of Garryowen.
F22 0820  1    He set out to keep Troop ~H the best troop in the best
F22 0820 14    regiment. One of his innovations was to see to it that
F22 0830 11    every man- cook and clerk as well as rifleman- qualified
F22 0840  8    with every weapon in the troop. Even the mess sergeant,
F22 0850  6    Bill Brown, a dapper, cocky transfer from an airborne
F22 0860  4    division, went out on the range.
F22 0860 10       The troop received a new leader, Lieutenant Robert
F22 0870  6    M& Carroll, fresh out of ~ROTC and bucking for Regular
F22 0880  6    Army status. Carroll was sharp and military, but he
F22 0890  5    was up against tough competition for that ~RA berth,
F22 0900  2    and he wanted to play it cool. So Mel Chandler set
F22 0900 13    out to sell him on the spirit of Garryowen, just as
F22 0910 10    he himself had been sold a short time before.
F22 0920  5       When the Korean war began, on June 25, 1950, the
F22 0930  3    anniversary of the day Custer had gone down fighting
F22 0930 12    at the Little Big Horn and the day the regiment had
F22 0940 10    assaulted the beachhead of Leyte during World War /2,,
F22 0950  7    the 7th Cavalry was not in the best fighting condition.
F22 0960  4    Its entire complement of non-commissioned officers
F22 0970  2    on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another
F22 0970 12    unit, and its vehicles were still those used in the
F22 0980 10    drive across Luzon in World War /2,.
F22 0990  3       Just a month after the Korean War broke out, the
F22 1000  2    7th Cavalry was moving into the lines, ready for combat.
F22 1000 12    From then on the Fighting Seventh was in the thick
F22 1010 10    of the bitterest fighting in Korea.
F22 1020  3       One night on the Naktong River, Mel Chandler called
F22 1030  2    on that fabled esprit de corps. The regiment was dug
F22 1030 12    in on the east side of the river and the North Koreans
F22 1040 12    were steadily building up a concentration of crack
F22 1050  6    troops on the other side. The troopers knew an attack
F22 1060  4    was coming, but they didn't know when, and they didn't
F22 1070  2    know where. At 6 o'clock on the morning of August 12,
F22 1070 13    they were in doubt no longer. Then it came, against
F22 1080 10    Troop ~H.
F22 1090  1       The enemy had filtered across the river during the
F22 1090 10    night and a full force of 1000 men, armed with Russian
F22 1100  8    machine guns, attacked the position held by Chandler's
F22 1110  4    men. They came in waves. First came the cannon fodder,
F22 1120  3    white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive
F22 1130  1    human battering ram. They were followed by crack North
F22 1130 10    Korean troops, who mounted one charge after another.
F22 1140  7    They overran the 7th Cav's forward machine-gun positions
F22 1150  5    through sheer weight of numbers, over piles of their
F22 1160  4    own dead.
F22 1160  6       Another force flanked the company and took up a
F22 1170  5    position on a hill to the rear. Captain Chandler saw
F22 1180  1    that it was building up strength. He assembled a group
F22 1180 11    of 25 men, composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation,
F22 1190  6    the company clerk, supply men, cooks and drivers, and
F22 1200  6    led them to the hill. One of the more seriously wounded
F22 1210  3    was Lieutenant Carroll, the young officer bucking for
F22 1220  2    the Regular Army. Chandler left Carroll at the bottom
F22 1220 11    of the hill to direct any reinforcements he could find
F22 1230  8    to the fight.
F22 1230 11       Then Mel Chandler started up the hill. He took one
F22 1240 10    step, two, broke into a trot and then into a run. The
F22 1250 10    first thing he knew the words "Garryowen"! burst from
F22 1260  3    his throat. His followers shouted the old battle cry
F22 1270  3    after him and charged the hill, firing as they ran.
F22 1280  1       The Koreans fell back, but regrouped at the top
F22 1280 10    of the hill and pinned down the cavalrymen with a screen
F22 1290  7    of fire. Chandler, looking to right and left to see
F22 1300  6    how his men were faring, suddenly saw another figure
F22 1310  1    bounding up the hill, hurling grenades and hollering
F22 1310  9    the battle cry as he ran. It was Bob Carroll, who had
F22 1320 10    suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of Garryowen.
F22 1330  6    He had formed his own task force of three stragglers
F22 1340  4    and led them up the hill in a Fighting Seventh charge.
F22 1350  1    Because of this diversionary attack the main group
F22 1350  9    that had been pinned down on the hill was able to surge
F22 1360 10    forward again. But an enemy grenade hit Carroll in
F22 1370  5    the head and detonated simultaneously. He went down
F22 1380  3    like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the
F22 1380 15    face of the withering enemy fire.
F22 1400  5       Enemy reinforcements came pouring down, seeking
F22 1410  2    a soft spot. They found it at the junction between
F22 1410 12    Troops ~H and ~G, and prepared to counterattack. Marvin
F22 1420  9    Goulding saw what was happening. He turned to his platoon.
F22 1430  9    "Okay, men", he said. "Follow me". Goulding leaped
F22 1440  6    to his feet and started forward, "Garryowen"! on his
F22 1450  4    lips, his men following. But the bullets whacked home
F22 1460  3    before he finished his battle cry and Marvin Goulding
F22 1470  1    fell dead. For an instant his men hesitated, unable
F22 1470 10    to believe that their lieutenant, the most popular
F22 1480  4    officer in the regiment, was dead. Then they let out
F22 1490  5    a bellow of anguish and rage and, cursing, screaming
F22 1500  1    and hollering "Garryowen"! they charged into the enemy
F22 1500  9    like wild men.
F22 1510  3       That finished the job that Captain Chandler and
F22 1510 11    Lieutenant Carroll had begun. Goulding's platoon pushed
F22 1520  7    back the enemy soldiers and broke up the timing of
F22 1530  8    the entire enemy attack. Reinforcements came up quickly
F22 1540  4    to take advantage of the opening made by Goulding's
F22 1550  1    platoon. The North Koreans threw away their guns and
F22 1550 10    fled across the rice paddies. Artillery and air strikes
F22 1560  9    were called in to kill them by the hundreds.
F22 1570  7       Though Bob Carroll seemed to have had his head practically
F22 1580  5    blown off by the exploding grenade, he lived. Today
F22 1590  2    he is a major- in the Regular Army.
F22 1590 10       So filled was Mel Chandler with the spirit of Garryowen
F22 1600  9    that after Korea was over, he took on the job of writing
F22 1610  9    the complete history of the regiment. After years of
F22 1620  4    digging, nights and weekends, he put together the big,
F22 1630  2    profusely illustrated book, Of Garryowen and Glory,
F22 1630  9    which is probably the most complete history of any
F22 1640  9    military unit.
F22 1640 11    ##
F22 1640 12    The battle of the Naktong River is just one example
F22 1650 10    of how the battle cry and the spirit of The Fighting
F22 1660  8    Seventh have paid off. For nearly a century the cry
F22 1670  5    has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment.
F22 1680  2       Take the case of Major Marcus A& Reno, who survived
F22 1690  1    the Battle of The Little Big Horn in 1876. From the
F22 1690 12    enlisted men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer
F22 1700  9    whose wife he tried to rape, a lot of men had plenty
F22 1710  9    of reason heartily to dislike Marcus Reno. Many of
F22 1720  4    his fellow officers refused to speak to him. But when
F22 1730  2    a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges
F22 1730 13    of cowardice made against him, the men who had seen
F22 1740  9    Reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had
F22 1750  6    heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured
F22 1760  4    by the Sioux, refused to say a harsh word against him.
F22 1770  1    He was a member of The Fighting Seventh.
F22 1770  9       Although it was at the Battle of The Little Horn,
F22 1780  7    about which more words have been written than any other
F22 1790  5    battle in American history, that the 7th Cavalry first
F22 1800  2    made its mark in history, the regiment was ten years
F22 1800 12    old by then. Brevet Major General George Armstrong
F22 1810  7    Custer was the regiment's first permanent commander
F22 1820  4    and, like such generals as George S& Patton and Terry
F22 1830  5    de la Mesa Allen in their rise to military prominence,
F22 1850  1    Custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare.
F22 1850 10       During the Civil War, Custer, who achieved a brilliant
F22 1860  9    record, was made brigadier general at the age of 23.
F22 1870  8       He finished the war as a major general, commanding
F22 1880  5    a full division, and at 25 was the youngest major general
F22 1890  3    in the history of the U& S& Army.
F23 0010  1    I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are
F23 0010 11    self-evident, in the sense that everyone agrees with
F23 0020  7    them. If they were, Walter Lippmann would be writing
F23 0030  4    the same columns as George Sokolsky, and Herblock would
F23 0040  2    have nothing to draw cartoons about. I do mean, however,
F23 0040 12    that I take them for granted, and that everything I
F23 0050 10    shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against
F23 0060  6    any contrary assumptions.
F23 0070  1    _ASSUMPTION 1._
F23 0070  2       The ultimate objective of American policy is to
F23 0070 10    help establish a world in which there is the largest
F23 0080  9    possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and
F23 0090  6    material prosperity; and in particular- since this
F23 0100  5    is our special responsibility- that these conditions
F23 0110  1    be enjoyed by the people of the United States. I speak
F23 0110 12    of "the largest possible measure" because any person
F23 0120  6    who supposes that these conditions can be universally
F23 0130  5    and perfectly achieved- ever- reckons without the inherent
F23 0140  4    imperfectability of himself and his fellow human beings,
F23 0150  2    and is therefore a dangerous man to have around.
F23 0160  1    _ASSUMPTION 2._
F23 0160  2       These conditions are unobtainable- are not even
F23 0160  9    approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated-
F23 0170  8    without the prior defeat of world Communism. This is
F23 0180  6    true for two reasons: because Communism is both doctrinally,
F23 0190  4    and in practice, antithetical to these conditions;
F23 0200  1    and because Communists have the will and, as long as
F23 0200 11    Soviet power remains intact, the capacity to prevent
F23 0210  8    their realization. Moreover, as Communist power increases,
F23 0220  5    the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world
F23 0230  4    diminishes pro rata and the possibility of their restoration
F23 0240  3    becomes increasingly remote.
F23 0240  6    _ASSUMPTION 3._
F23 0240  8       It follows that victory over Communism is the dominant,
F23 0250  9    proximate goal of American policy. Proximate in the
F23 0260  7    sense that there are more distant, more "positive"
F23 0270  3    ends we seek, to which victory over Communism is but
F23 0280  3    a means. But dominant in the sense that every other
F23 0280 13    objective, no matter how worthy intrinsically, must
F23 0290  7    defer to it. Peace is a worthy objective; but if we
F23 0300  5    must choose between peace and keeping the Communists
F23 0310  2    out of Berlin, then we must fight. Freedom, in the
F23 0310 12    sense of self-determination, is a worthy objective;
F23 0320  8    but if granting self-determination to the Algerian
F23 0330  4    rebels entails sweeping that area into the Sino-Soviet
F23 0340  4    orbit, then Algerian freedom must be postponed. Justice
F23 0350  1    is a worthy objective; but if justice for Bantus entails
F23 0350 11    driving the government of the Union of South Africa
F23 0360  9    away from the West, then the Bantus must be prepared
F23 0370  7    to carry their identification cards yet a while longer.
F23 0380  5    Prosperity is a worthy objective; but if providing
F23 0390  1    higher standards of living gets in the way of producing
F23 0390 11    sufficient guns to resist Communist aggression, then
F23 0400  7    material sacrifices and denials will have to be made.
F23 0410  7    It may be, of course, that such objectives can be pursued
F23 0420  4    consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism;
F23 0430  1    my point is that where conflicts arise they must always
F23 0430 11    be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable
F23 0440  8    condition for a tolerant world- the absence of Soviet
F23 0450  5    Communist power.
F23 0450  7    #THE USES OF POWER#
F23 0460  2    This much having been said, the question remains whether
F23 0460 11    we have the resources for the job we have to do- defeat
F23 0470 12    Communism- and, if so, how those resources ought to
F23 0480  9    be used. This brings us squarely to the problem of
F23 0490  5    power, and the uses a nation makes of power. I submit
F23 0500  3    that this is the key problem of international relations,
F23 0500 12    that it always has been, that it always will be. And
F23 0510 11    I suggest further that the main cause of the trouble
F23 0520  8    we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers,
F23 0530  4    ever since we assumed free world leadership in 1945,
F23 0540  3    to deal with this problem realistically and seriously.
F23 0550  1       In the recent political campaign two charges were
F23 0550  8    leveled affecting the question of power, and I think
F23 0560  8    we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus.
F23 0570  4    One was demonstrably false; the other, for the most
F23 0580  2    part, true.
F23 0580  4       The first was that America had become- or was in
F23 0590  3    danger of becoming- a second-rate military power. I
F23 0590 12    know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of
F23 0600 11    that contention. You may have misgivings about certain
F23 0610  6    aspects of our military establishment- I certainly
F23 0620  5    do- but you know any comparison of over-all American
F23 0630  1    strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United
F23 0630 10    States not only superior, but so superior both in present
F23 0640 10    weapons and in the development of new ones that our
F23 0650  7    advantage promises to be a permanent feature of U&S&-Soviet
F23 0660  5    relations for the foreseeable future.
F23 0670  1       I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing
F23 0670 11    our superiority on those Americans who have doubts,
F23 0680  7    and I think Mr& Jameson Campaigne has done it well
F23 0690  6    in his new book American Might and Soviet Myth. Suppose,
F23 0710  3    he says, that the tables were turned, and we were in
F23 0720  3    the Soviets' position: "There would be more than 2,000
F23 0730  1    modern Soviet fighters, all better than ours, stationed
F23 0730  9    at 250 bases in Mexico and the Caribbean. Overwhelming
F23 0740  7    Russian naval power would always be within a few hundred
F23 0750  7    miles of our coast. Half of the population of the U&S&
F23 0760  4    would be needed to work on arms just to feed the people".
F23 0770  3    Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where
F23 0780  1    oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the
F23 0780 12    first opportunity. Add also a comparatively primitive
F23 0790  6    industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity
F23 0800  5    to keep abreast of the Soviets even in the missile
F23 0810  2    field which is reputed to be our main strength.
F23 0810 11       If we look at the situation this way, we can get
F23 0820 11    an idea of Khrushchev's nightmarish worries- or, at
F23 0830  5    least, of the worries he might have if his enemies
F23 0840  3    were disposed to exploit their advantage.
F23 0840  9    #U&S& "PRESTIGE"#
F23 0850  1    The other charge was that America's political position
F23 0860  1    in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent
F23 0860  9    years. The contention needs to be formulated with much
F23 0870  8    greater precision than it ever was during the campaign,
F23 0880  6    but once that has been done, I fail to see how any
F23 0890  4    serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it.
F23 0900  1       The argument was typically advanced in terms of
F23 0900  9    U&S& "prestige". Prestige, however, is only a minor
F23 0910  7    part of the problem; and even then, it is a concept
F23 0920  7    that can be highly misleading. Prestige is a measure
F23 0930  4    of how other people think of you, well or ill. But
F23 0930 15    contrary to what was implied during the campaign, prestige
F23 0940  9    is surely not important for its own sake. Only the
F23 0950  7    vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep
F23 0960  5    simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed
F23 0970  1    by our strength as they ought to be. The thing to lose
F23 0970 13    sleep over is what people, having concluded that we
F23 0980  8    are weaker than we are, are likely to do about it.
F23 0990  6       The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe
F23 1000  2    the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union,
F23 1000 11    and is bound to fall still further behind in the years
F23 1010 11    ahead. This ignorant estimate, I repeat, is not of
F23 1020  7    any interest in itself; but it becomes very important
F23 1030  3    if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically
F23 1040  1    do- namely, by taking steps to end up on what appears
F23 1040 11    to be the winning side. To the extent, then, that declining
F23 1050 10    U&S& prestige means that other nations will be tempted
F23 1060  8    to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat,
F23 1070  5    and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation,
F23 1080  2    there is reason for concern.
F23 1080  7       Still, these guesses about the outcome of the struggle
F23 1090  7    cannot be as important as the actual power relationship
F23 1100  4    between the Soviet Union and ourselves. Here I do not
F23 1110  4    speak of military power where our advantage is obvious
F23 1110 13    and overwhelming but of political power- of influence,
F23 1120  8    if you will- about which the relevant questions are:
F23 1130  7    Is Soviet influence throughout the world greater or
F23 1140  5    less than it was ten years ago? And is Western influence
F23 1150  2    greater or less than it used to be?
F23 1150 10    #COMMUNIST GAINS#
F23 1160  1    In answering these questions, we need to ask not merely
F23 1160 11    whether Communist troops have crossed over into territories
F23 1170  8    they did not occupy before, and not merely whether
F23 1180  6    disciplined agents of the Cominform are in control
F23 1190  4    of governments from which they were formerly excluded:
F23 1200  1    the success of Communism's war against the West does
F23 1200 10    not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests.
F23 1210  7    Success may mean merely the displacement of Western
F23 1220  5    influence.
F23 1220  6       Communist political warfare, we must remember, is
F23 1230  6    waged insidiously and in deliberate stages. Fearful
F23 1240  2    of inviting a military showdown with the West which
F23 1240 11    they could not win, the Communists seek to undermine
F23 1250  9    Western power where the nuclear might of the West is
F23 1260  8    irrelevant- in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes, in mob
F23 1270  3    uprisings in the streets, in parliaments, in clandestine
F23 1280  1    meetings of undercover conspirators, at the United
F23 1280  8    Nations, on the propaganda front, at diplomatic conferences-
F23 1290  8    preferably at the highest level.
F23 1300  4       The Soviets understand, moreover, that the first
F23 1310  2    step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn
F23 1310 12    it against the West. Thus, typically, the first stage
F23 1320  8    of a Communist takeover is to "neutralize" a country.
F23 1330  6    The second stage is to retain the nominal classification
F23 1340  3    of "neutralist", while in fact turning the country
F23 1350  2    into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy.
F23 1350 11    And this may be as far as the process will go. The
F23 1360 12    Kremlin's goal is the isolation and capture, not of
F23 1370  7    Ghana, but of the United States- and this purpose may
F23 1380  7    be served very well by countries that masquerade under
F23 1390  2    a "neutralist" mask, yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries
F23 1400  1    of the Soviet Foreign Office.
F23 1400  6       To recite the particulars of recent Soviet successes
F23 1410  4    is hardly reassuring.
F23 1410  7       Six years ago French Indochina, though in troubie,
F23 1420  6    was in the Western camp. Today Northern Vietnam is
F23 1430  4    overtly Communist; Laos is teetering between Communism
F23 1440  2    and pro-Communist neutralism; Cambodia is, for all
F23 1450  1    practical purposes, neutralist.
F23 1450  4       Indonesia, in the early days of the Republic, leaned
F23 1460  4    toward the West. Today Sukarno's government is heavily
F23 1470  3    besieged by avowed Communists, and for all of its "neutralist"
F23 1480  1    pretensions, it is a firm ally of Soviet policy.
F23 1490  1       Ceylon has moved from a pro-Western orientation
F23 1490  8    to a neutralism openly hostile to the West.
F23 1500  5       In the Middle East, Iraq, Syria and Egypt were,
F23 1510  3    a short while ago, in the Western camp. Today the Nasser
F23 1520  1    and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the
F23 1520  9    West, are dependent for their military power on Soviet
F23 1530  7    equipment and personnel; in almost every particular
F23 1540  5    follow the Kremlin's foreign policy line.
F23 1550  1       A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve.
F23 1550 11    Never mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed
F23 1560  9    Wilsonian self-determination: the point is that in
F23 1570  6    the struggle for the world that vast land mass was
F23 1580  5    under the domination and influence of the West. Today,
F23 1590  1    Africa is swerving violently away from the West and
F23 1590 10    plunging, it would seem, into the Soviet orbit.
F23 1600  8       Latin America was once an area as "safe" for the
F23 1610  7    West as Nebraska was for Nixon. Today it is up for
F23 1620  5    grabs. One Latin American country, Cuba, has become
F23 1630  1    a Soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast. In
F23 1630 10    some countries the trend has gone further than others:
F23 1640  8    Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela are displaying open sympathy
F23 1650  5    for Castroism, and there is no country- save the Dominican
F23 1660  6    Republic whose funeral services we recently arranged-
F23 1670  1    where Castroism and anti-Americanism does not prevent
F23 1680  1    the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American
F23 1680  8    cause.
F23 1690  1       Only in Europe have our lines remained firm- and
F23 1690 10    there only on the surface. The strains of neutralism
F23 1700  6    are running strong, notably in England, and even in
F23 1710  5    Germany.
F23 1710  6    #OPPORTUNITIES MISSED#
F23 1710  8    What have we to show by way of counter-successes? We
F23 1720 10    have had opportunities- clear invitations to plant
F23 1730  7    our influence on the other side of the Iron Curtain.
F23 1740  2    There was the Hungarian Revolution which we praised
F23 1750  1    and mourned, but did nothing about. There was the Polish
F23 1750 11    Revolution which we misunderstood and then helped guide
F23 1760  8    along a course favorable to Soviet interests. There
F23 1770  5    was the revolution in Tibet which we pretended did
F23 1780  2    not exist. Only in one instance have we moved purposively
F23 1790  1    and effectively to dislodge existing Communist power:
F23 1790  8    in Guatemala. And contrary to what has been said recently,
F23 1800  9    we did not wait for "outside pressures" and "world
F23 1810  4    opinion" to bring down that Communist government; we
F23 1820  3    moved decisively to effect an anti-Communist coup d'etat.
F23 1830  2    We served our national interests, and by so doing we
F23 1840  1    saved the Guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery.
F24 0010  1       THE FIRST RATTLE of the machine guns, at 7:10 in
F24 0010 11    the evening, roused around me the varied voices and
F24 0020  8    faces of fear.
F24 0030  1       "Sounds exactly like last time". The young man spoke
F24 0030  9    steadily enough, but all at once he looked grotesquely
F24 0040  8    unshaven. The middle-aged man said over and over, "Why
F24 0050  6    did I come here, why did I come here". Then he was
F24 0060  4    sick. Amid the crackle of small arms and automatic
F24 0060 13    weapons, I heard the thumping of mortars. Then the
F24 0070  9    lights went out.
F24 0075  1       This was my second day in Vientiane, the administrative
F24 0080  7    capital of Laos, and my thoughts were none too brave.
F24 0090  9    Where was my flashlight? Where should I go? To my room?
F24 0100  8    Better stay in the hotel lobby, where the walls looked
F24 0110  5    good and thick.
F24 0110  8       Chinese and Indian merchants across the street were
F24 0120  6    slamming their steel shutters. Hotel attendants pulled
F24 0130  3    parked bicycles into the lobby. A woman with a small
F24 0140  1    boy slipped in between them. "Please", she said, "please".
F24 0150  1    She held out her hand to show that she had money.
F24 0150 12       The American newspaperman worried about getting
F24 0160  5    to the cable office. But what was the story? Had the
F24 0170  6    Communist-led Pathet Lao finally come this far? Or
F24 0180  3    was it another revolt inside Vientiane?
F24 0180  9       "Let's play hero", I said. "Let's go to the roof
F24 0190 10    and see".
F24 0200  1    #GUNFIRE SAVES THE MOON#
F24 0200  4    By 7:50 the answer was plain. There had been an eclipse
F24 0210  4    of the moon. A traditional Lao explanation is that
F24 0220  1    the moon was being swallowed by a toad, and the remedy
F24 0220 12    was to make all possible noise, ideally with firearms.
F24 0230  6       The din was successful, too, for just before the
F24 0240  6    moon disappeared, the frightened toad had begun to
F24 0250  2    spit it out again, which meant good luck all around.
F24 0250 12       How quaint it all seemed the next day. A restaurant
F24 0270 10    posted a reminder to patrons "who became excited and
F24 0280  6    left without paying their checks". But everyone I met
F24 0290  5    had sought cover first and asked questions later. And
F24 0300  2    no wonder, for Vientiane, the old City of Sandalwood,
F24 0300 11    had become the City of Bullet Holes.
F24 0310  7       I saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars
F24 0320  5    in the streets. Along the main thoroughfares hardly
F24 0330  1    a house had not been peppered. In place of the police
F24 0330 12    headquarters was a new square filled with rubble. Mortars
F24 0340  9    had demolished the defense ministry and set fire to
F24 0350  7    the American Embassy next door. What had been the ambassador's
F24 0360  5    suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick.
F24 0370  2       This damage had been done in the battle of Vientiane,
F24 0380  1    fought less than three months earlier when four successive
F24 0380 10    governments had ruled here in three days (December
F24 0390  8    9-11, 1960). And now, in March, all Laos suffered a
F24 0400  5    state of siege. The Pathet Lao forces held two northern
F24 0410  3    provinces and openly took the offensive in three more.
F24 0420  1    Throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread
F24 0420 10    fear of ambush and death.
F24 0430  3       "And it's all the more tragic because it's so little
F24 0440  3    deserved", said Mr& J& J& A& Frans, a Belgian official
F24 0450  2    of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and
F24 0450  9    Cultural Organization. We talked after I hailed his
F24 0460  8    Jeep marked with the U& N& flag.
F24 0470  5       Practically all the people of Laos, he explained-
F24 0480  1    about two million of them- are rice farmers, and the
F24 0480 11    means and motives of modern war are as strange to them
F24 0490 11    as clocks and steel plows. They look after their fields
F24 0500  7    and children and water buffaloes in ten or eleven thousand
F24 0510  6    villages, with an average of 200 souls. Nobody can
F24 0520  3    tell more closely how many villages there are. They
F24 0520 12    spread over an area no larger than Oregon; yet they
F24 0530 10    include peoples as different from one another as Oregonians
F24 0540  6    are from Patagonians.
F24 0540  9    #LIFE MUST BE KEPT IN HARMONY#
F24 0550  6    "What matters here is family loyalty; faith in the
F24 0560  4    Buddha and staying at peace with the phis, the spirits;
F24 0570  1    and to live in harmony with nature".
F24 0570  8       Harmony in Laos? "Precisely", said Mr& Frans. He
F24 0580  6    spoke of the season of dryness and dust, brought by
F24 0590  6    the monsoon from the northeast, in harmony with the
F24 0600  3    season of rain and mud, brought by the monsoon from
F24 0600 13    the southwest. The slim pirogues in harmony with the
F24 0610  8    majestically meandering Mekong River. Shy, slender-waisted
F24 0620  6    girls at the loom in harmony with the frangipani by
F24 0630  4    the wayside. Even life in harmony with death. For so
F24 0640  2    long as death was not violent, it was natural and to
F24 0640 13    be welcomed, making a funeral a feast.
F24 0650  6       To many a Frenchman- they came 95 years ago, colonized,
F24 0660  5    and stayed until Laos became independent in 1953- the
F24 0670  2    land had been even more delightfully tranquil than
F24 0670 10    Tahiti. Yet Laos was now one of the most explosive
F24 0680 10    headaches of statesmen around the globe. The Pathet
F24 0690  6    Lao, stiffened by Communist Veterans from neighboring
F24 0700  3    North Viet Nam, were supplied by Soviet aircraft. The
F24 0710  2    Royal Lao Army, on the other hand, was paid and equipped
F24 0710 13    with American funds. In six years, U& S& aid had amounted
F24 0720 11    to more than $1.60 for each American- a total of three
F24 0730 10    hundred million dollars.
F24 0740  1       We were there at a moment when the situation in
F24 0740 11    Laos threatened to ignite another war among the world's
F24 0750  8    giants. Even if it did not, how would this little world
F24 0760  8    of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenades
F24 0770  5    and submachine guns?
F24 0770  8       To find out, we traveled throughout that part of
F24 0780  6    Laos still nominally controlled, in the daytime at
F24 0790  4    least, by the Royal Lao Army: from Attopeu, the City
F24 0800  1    of Buffalo Dung in the southeast, to Muong Sing, the
F24 0800 11    City of Lions in the northwest, close to Communist
F24 0810  8    China (map, page 250). We rode over roads so rough
F24 0820  7    that our Jeep came to rest atop the soil between ruts,
F24 0830  3    all four wheels spinning uselessly. We flew in rickety
F24 0840  1    planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn't
F24 0840 10    crash. In the end we ran into Communist artillery fire.
F24 0850  8       "We" were Bill Garrett of the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC
F24 0860  6    Illustrations Staff, whose three cameras and eight
F24 0870  5    lenses made him look as formidable as any fighting
F24 0880  2    man we met; Boun My, our interpreter; and myself.
F24 0890  1       Boun My- the name means one who has a boun, a celebration,
F24 0890 13    and is therefore lucky- was born in Savannakhet, the
F24 0900  9    Border of Paradise. He had attended three universities
F24 0910  6    in the United States. But he had never seen the mountainous
F24 0920  7    half of his native land north of Vientiane, including
F24 0930  2    the royal capital, Luang Prabang. Before the airplanes
F24 0940  1    came, he said, travel in Laos was just about impossible.
F24 0940 11    #PRIME MINISTER MOVES FAST#
F24 0950  4    Alas, so it almost proved for us, too. To go outside
F24 0960  3    the few cities required permits. and getting them seemed
F24 0970  1    a life's work. Nobody wanted Americans to be hurt or
F24 0970 11    captured, and few soldiers could be spared as escorts.
F24 0980  8       We were told that to the Pathet Lao, a kidnaped
F24 0990  6    American was worth at least $750, a fortune in Laos.
F24 1000  3    Everyone had heard of the American contractor who had
F24 1010  1    spurned an escort. Now Pathet Lao propagandists were
F24 1010  9    reported marching him barefoot from village to village,
F24 1020  7    as evidence of evil American intervention.
F24 1030  2       Although we enjoyed our rounds of the government
F24 1040  1    offices in Vientiane, with officials offering tea and
F24 1040  9    pleasing conversation in French, we were getting nowhere.
F24 1050  7    We had nearly decided that all the tales of Lao lethargy
F24 1060  8    must be true, when we were invited to take a trip with
F24 1070  6    the Prime Minister. Could we be ready in 15 minutes?
F24 1080  2    His Highness had decided only two hours ago to go out
F24 1080 13    of town, and he was eager to be off.
F24 1090  9    #PRINCE WEARS TEN-GALLON HAT#
F24 1090 14    And so, after a flight southeast to Savannakhet, we
F24 1100  9    found ourselves bouncing along in a Jeep right behind
F24 1110  7    the Land-Rover of Prince Boun Oum of Champassak, a
F24 1120  5    tall man of Churchillian mien in a bush jacket and
F24 1130  2    a ten-gallon hat from Texas. From his shoulder bag
F24 1130 12    peeked the seven-inch barrel of a Luger.
F24 1140  7       The temperature rose to 105`. With our company of
F24 1150  5    soldiers, we made one long column of reddish dust.
F24 1160  1       In Keng Kok, the City of Silkworms, the Prime Minister
F24 1170  1    bought fried chickens and fried cicadas, and two notebooks
F24 1170 10    for me. Then we drove on, until there was no more road
F24 1180 11    and we traversed dry rice fields, bouncing across their
F24 1190  5    squat earth walls.
F24 1190  8       It was a spleen-crushing day. An hour of bouncing,
F24 1200  8    a brief stop in a village to inspect a new school or
F24 1210  6    dispensary. More bouncing, another stop, a new house
F24 1220  3    for teachers, a new well. Then off again, rushing to
F24 1220 13    keep up. We were miserable.
F24 1230  4       But our two Jeep mates- Keo Viphakone from Luang
F24 1240  3    Prabang and John Cool from Beaver, Pennsylvania- were
F24 1250  4    beaming under their coatings of dust. Together they
F24 1250 12    had probably done more than any other men to help push
F24 1260 10    Laos toward the 20th century- constructively. Mr& Keo,
F24 1270  4    once a diplomat in Paris and Washington, was Commissioner
F24 1280  3    of Rural Affairs. John, an engineer and anthropologist
F24 1290  1    with a doctorate from the London School of Economics,
F24 1300  1    headed the rural development division of ~USOM, the
F24 1300  9    United States Operations Mission administering U&S&
F24 1310  5    aid.
F24 1310  6       "What you see are self-help projects", John said.
F24 1320  9    "We ask the people what they want, and they supply
F24 1330  7    the labor. We send shovels, cement, nails, and corrugated
F24 1340  3    iron for roofs. That way they have an infirmary for
F24 1350  2    $400. We have 2,500 such projects, and they add up
F24 1350 12    to a lot more than just roads and wells and schools.
F24 1360  8    Ask Mr& Keo".
F24 1370  1       Mr& Keo agreed. "Our people have been used to accepting
F24 1380 10    things as they found them", he said. "Where there was
F24 1390  9    no road, they lived without one. Now they learn that
F24 1400  7    men can change their surroundings, through their traditional
F24 1410  4    village elders, without violence. That's a big step
F24 1420  4    toward a modern state. You might say we are in the
F24 1420 15    nation-building business".
F24 1430  2       In the villages people lined up to give us flowers.
F24 1440  3    Then came coconuts, eggs, and rice wine. The Prime
F24 1440 12    Minister paid his respects to the Buddhist monks, strode
F24 1450  9    rapidly among the houses, joked with the local soldiery,
F24 1460  7    and made a speech. The soldiers are fighting and the
F24 1470  5    Americans are helping, he said, but in the fight against
F24 1480  3    the Pathet Lao the key factor is the villager himself.
F24 1490  1       Then we were off again. We did it for three days.
F24 1490 12       But our stumping tour of the south wasn't all misery.
F24 1500 10    Crossing the 4,000-foot width of the Mekong at Champassak,
F24 1510  7    on a raft with an outboard motor, we took off our dusty
F24 1520  7    shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean breeze. Then we
F24 1530  4    hung overboard in the water.
F24 1530  9       Briefly we rolled over a paved road up to Pak Song,
F24 1540  9    on the cool Bolovens Plateau. The Prince visited the
F24 1550  5    hospital of Operation Brotherhood, supported by the
F24 1560  3    Junior Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, and
F24 1560 11    fed rice to two pet elephants he kept at his residence
F24 1570 10    at Pak Song.
F24 1570 13    #STRINGS KEEP SOULS IN PLACE#
F24 1580  5    In the village of Soukhouma, which means "Peaceful",
F24 1590  2    we had a baci. This is the most endearing of Lao ceremonies.
F24 1600  2    It takes place in the household, a rite of well-wishing
F24 1610  1    for myriad occasions- for the traveler, a wedding,
F24 1610  9    a newborn child, the sick, the New Year, for any good
F24 1620  9    purpose.
F24 1620 10       The preparations were elaborate: flowers, candles,
F24 1630  5    incense sticks, rice wine, dozens of delicacies, and
F24 1640  4    pieces of white cotton string. The strings were draped
F24 1650  2    around flowers in tall silver bowls (page 261).
F24 1650 10       The candles were lighted, and we sat on split-bamboo
F24 1660 10    mats among the village notables. I was careful to keep
F24 1670  7    my feet, the seat of the least worthy spirits, from
F24 1680  3    pointing at anyone's head, where the worthiest spirits
F24 1690  1    reside. Now a distinguished old man called on nine
F24 1690 10    divinities to come and join us.
F24 1700  5       Next he addressed himself to our souls. A man has
F24 1710  3    32 souls, one for each part of the body. Those souls
F24 1710 14    like to wander off, and must be called back.
F24 1720  8       With the divinities present and our souls in place,
F24 1730  6    we were wished health, happiness, and power. Then,
F24 1740  2    one after another, the villagers tied the waiting cotton
F24 1740 11    strings around our wrists. These were to be kept on,
F24 1750 10    to hold in the 32 souls.
F24 1760  1       As we stepped out into the sunlight, a man came
F24 1760 11    up to John Cool and silently showed him his hand. It
F24 1770  9    had a festering hole as big as a silver dollar. We
F24 1780  7    could see maggots moving.
F24 1780 11       John said: "I have some antiseptic salve with me,
F24 1790  8    but it's too late for that".
F25 0010  1       My interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait
F25 0010  9    of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds. Jewish
F25 0020  7    identity was often confused with social and economic
F25 0030  5    strivings. "Being Jewish gives you tremendous drive",
F25 0040  2    a boy remarked. "It means that you have to get ahead".
F25 0050  2    When I pressed for a purely religious definition, I
F25 0050 11    encountered the familiar blend of liberal piety, interfaith
F25 0060  8    good will, and a small residue of ethnic loyalty.
F25 0070  7       "I like the tradition", a girl said. "I like to
F25 0080  7    follow the holidays when they come along. But you don't
F25 0090  4    have to worship in the traditional way. You can communicate
F25 0100  1    in your own way. As I see it, there's no real difference
F25 0100 13    between being Jewish, Catholic, or Protestant".
F25 0110  6       Another teen-ager remarked: "Most Jews don't believe
F25 0120  6    in God, but they believe in people- in helping people".
F25 0130  6    Still another boy asserted: "To be a good Jew is to
F25 0140  8    do no wrong; it's to be a good person". When asked
F25 0150  3    how this was different from being a good Protestant,
F25 0160  1    the boy answered, "It's the same thing".
F25 0160  8       This accords with the study by Maier and Spinrad.
F25 0170  8    They discovered that, although 42 per cent of a sample
F25 0180  7    of Catholic students and 15 per cent of the Protestants
F25 0190  2    believed it important to live in accordance with the
F25 0190 11    teachings of their religion, only 8 per cent of the
F25 0200 10    Jewish students had this conviction. The most important
F25 0210  5    aims of the Jewish students were as follows: to make
F25 0220  4    the world a better place to live in- 30 per cent; to
F25 0230  2    get happiness for yourself- 28 per cent; and financial
F25 0230 11    independence- 21 per cent.
F25 0240  6       Nevertheless, most of the teen-agers I interviewed
F25 0250  3    believed in maintaining their Jewish identity and even
F25 0260  1    envisioned joining a synagogue or temple. However,
F25 0260  8    they were hostile to Jewish Orthodoxy, professing to
F25 0270  6    believe in Judaism "but in a moderate way". One boy
F25 0280  5    said querulously about Orthodox Jews: "It's the twentieth
F25 0290  3    century, and they don't have to wear beards".
F25 0300  1       The reason offered for clinging to the ancestral
F25 0300  9    faith lacked force and authority even in the teen-agers'
F25 0310  9    minds. "We were brought up that way" was one statement
F25 0320  7    which won general assent. "I want to show respect for
F25 0330  6    my parents' religion" was the way in which a boy justified
F25 0340  4    his inhabiting a halfway house of Judaism. Still another
F25 0350  2    suggested that he would join a temple "for social reasons,
F25 0360  1    since I'll be living in a suburb".
F25 0360  8       Intermarriage, which is generally regarded as a
F25 0370  6    threat to Jewish survival, was regarded not with horror
F25 0380  3    or apprehension but with a kind of mild, clinical disapproval.
F25 0390  1    Most of the teen-agers I interviewed rejected it on
F25 0390 11    pragmatic grounds. "When you marry, you want to have
F25 0400  9    things in common", a girl said, "and it's hard when
F25 0410  7    you don't marry someone with your own background".
F25 0420  3       A fourteen-year-old girl from the Middle West observed
F25 0430  3    wryly that, in her community, religion inconveniently
F25 0430 10    interfered with religious activities- at least with
F25 0440  7    the peripheral activities that many middle class Jews
F25 0450  6    now regard as religious. It appears that an Orthodox
F25 0460  4    girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing
F25 0470  1    sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups because
F25 0470 10    she would not travel on Saturday and, in addition,
F25 0480  8    required kosher food. Another girl from a relatively
F25 0490  5    large midwestern city described herself as "the only
F25 0500  2    Orthodox girl in town". This is, no doubt, inaccurate,
F25 0510  1    but it does convey how isolated she feels among the
F25 0510 11    vast army of the nonobservant.
F25 0520  1    #THE OLDER TEENS#
F25 0520  4    One of the significant things about Jewish culture
F25 0530  3    in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented.
F25 0550  1    Sixty-five per cent of the Jewish teen-agers of college
F25 0560  1    age attend institutions of higher learning. This is
F25 0560  9    substantially higher than the figures for the American
F25 0570  7    population at large- 45.6 per cent for males and 29.2
F25 0580  6    per cent for females. This may help explain a phenomenon
F25 0590  3    described by a small-town Jewish boy. In their first
F25 0590 13    two years in high school, Jewish boys in this town
F25 0600 10    make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school
F25 0610  7    teams. However, in their junior and senior years, they
F25 0620  4    generally forego their athletic pursuits, presumably
F25 0630  1    in the interest of better academic achievement. It
F25 0630  9    is significant, too, that the older teen-agers I interviewed
F25 0640  9    believed, unlike the younger ones, that Jewish students
F25 0650  6    tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts.
F25 0660  4       The percentage of Jewish girls who attend college
F25 0670  4    is almost as high as that of boys. The motivations
F25 0680  1    for both sexes, to be sure, are different. The vocational
F25 0680 11    motive is the dominant one for boys, while Jewish girls
F25 0690  9    attend college for social reasons and to become culturally
F25 0700  6    developed. One of the significant developments in American-Jewish
F25 0710  5    life is that the cultural consumers are largely the
F25 0720  4    women. It is they who read- and make- Jewish best-sellers
F25 0730  3    and then persuade their husbands to read them.
F25 0740  1       In upper teen Jewish life, the non-college group
F25 0740  9    tends to have a sense of marginality. "People automatically
F25 0750  5    assume that I'm in college", a nineteen-year-old machinist
F25 0760  6    observed irritably. However, among the girls, there
F25 0770  4    are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going
F25 0780  1    to college. The Jewish working girl almost invariably
F25 0780  9    works in an office- in contradistinction to gentile
F25 0790  5    factory workers- and, buttressed by a respectable income,
F25 0800  5    she is likely to dress better and live more expansively
F25 0810  3    than the college student. She is even prone to regard
F25 0820  1    the college girl as immature.
F25 0820  6    #THE LOWER-MIDDLE CLASS COLLEGE STUDENT#
F25 0830  1    One of the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish
F25 0830 11    teen-agers in college is that a great many urban Jews
F25 0840 10    are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost.
F25 0850  6    This is particularly true in large centers of Jewish
F25 0860  3    population like New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia.
F25 0870  1       What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers
F25 0870 11    is that, although their attitudes hardly differentiate
F25 0880  7    them from their gentile counterparts, they actually
F25 0890  3    lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed Jewish cosmos
F25 0900  3    with relatively little contact with the non-Jewish
F25 0910  1    world.
F25 0910  2       Perhaps the Jewish students at Brooklyn College-
F25 0920  3    constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day
F25 0920 13    session- can serve as a paradigm of the urban, lower-middle
F25 0930 10    class Jewish student.
F25 0940  1       There is, to begin, an important sex difference.
F25 0940  9    Typically, in a lower-middle class Jewish family, a
F25 0950  8    son will be sent to an out-of-town school, if financial
F25 0960  4    resources warrant it, while the daughter will attend
F25 0970  2    the local college. There are two reasons for this.
F25 0970 11    First, the girl's education has a lower priority than
F25 0980  9    the son's. Second, the attitude in Jewish families
F25 0990  6    is far more protective toward the daughter than toward
F25 1000  3    the son. Most Jewish mothers are determined to exercise
F25 1010  1    vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their
F25 1010 10    daughters by keeping them home. The consequence of
F25 1020  7    this is that the girls at Brooklyn College outnumber
F25 1030  3    the boys and do somewhat better academically. One can
F25 1040  3    assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town.
F25 1040 14       Brooklyn College students have an ambivalent attitude
F25 1050  8    toward their school. On the one hand, there is a sense
F25 1060 10    of not having moved beyond the ambiance of their high
F25 1070  6    school. This is particularly acute for those who attended
F25 1080  4    Midwood High School directly across the street from
F25 1090  2    Brooklyn College. They have a sense of marginality
F25 1090 10    at being denied that special badge of status, the out-of-town
F25 1100 10    school. At the same time, there is a good deal of
F25 1110  8    self-congratulation
F25 1110 10    at attending a good college- they are even inclined
F25 1120  5    to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues- and they
F25 1130  3    express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling that
F25 1140  2    the college generates. "It's people of your own kind",
F25 1140 11    a girl remarked. "You don't have to watch what you
F25 1150  9    say. Of course, I would like to go to an out-of-town
F25 1160 11    school where there are all kinds of people, but I would
F25 1170  6    want lots of Jewish kids there".
F25 1170 12       For most Brooklyn College students, college is at
F25 1180  8    once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachments and
F25 1190  6    a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood and family.
F25 1200  3    @rooklyn College is unequivocally Jewish in tone, and
F25 1210  3    efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably
F25 1220  1    midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing.
F25 1220  9    However, a growing intellectual sophistication and
F25 1230  5    the new certitudes imparted by courses in psychology
F25 1240  4    and anthropology make the students increasingly critical
F25 1250  2    of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents.
F25 1250  9    And the rebellion of these third generation Jews is
F25 1260  9    not the traditional conflict of culture but, rather,
F25 1270  6    a protest against a culture that they view as softly
F25 1280  4    and insidiously enveloping. "As long as I'm home, I'll
F25 1290  2    never grow up", a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly.
F25 1300  1    "They don't like it if I do anything away from home.
F25 1300 12    It's so much trouble, I don't usually bother".
F25 1310  7       For girls, the overprotection is far more pervasive.
F25 1320  5    Parents will drive on Friday night to pick up their
F25 1330  5    daughters after a sorority or House Plan meeting. A
F25 1340  2    freshman girl's father not too long ago called a dean
F25 1340 12    at Brooklyn College and demanded the "low-down" on
F25 1350  8    a boy who was going out with his daughter. The domestic
F25 1360  6    tentacles even extend to the choice of a major field.
F25 1370  5    Under pressure from parents, the majority of Brooklyn
F25 1380  1    College girls major in education since that co-ordinates
F25 1380 10    best with marriage plans- limited graduate study requirement
F25 1390  7    and convenient working hours. This means that a great
F25 1400  8    many academically talented girls are discouraged from
F25 1410  4    pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature.
F25 1420  1    A kind of double standard exists here for Jewish boys
F25 1420 11    and girls as it does in the realm of sex.
F25 1430  9       The breaking away from the prison house of Brooklyn
F25 1440  4    is gradual. First, the student trains on his hapless
F25 1450  2    parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological
F25 1460  1    and sociological insights. Then, with the new affluence,
F25 1460  9    there is actually a sallying forth into the wide, wide
F25 1470  9    world beyond the precincts of New York. It is significant
F25 1480  7    that the Catskills, which used to be the summer playground
F25 1490  5    for older teen-agers, a kind of summer suburb of New
F25 1500  3    York, no longer attracts them in great numbers- except
F25 1500 12    for those who work there as waiters, bus boys, or counselors
F25 1510 11    in the day camps. The great world beyond beckons. But
F25 1520  8    it should be pointed out that some of the new watering
F25 1530  7    places- Fire Island, Nantucket, Westhampton, Long Island,
F25 1540  3    for example- tend to be homogeneously Jewish. Although
F25 1550  2    Brooklyn College does not yet have a junior-year-abroad
F25 1560  1    program, a good number of students spend summers in
F25 1560 10    Europe. In general, however, the timetable of travel
F25 1570  7    lags considerably behind that of the student at Harvard
F25 1580  6    or Smith. And acculturation into the world at large
F25 1590  3    is likely to occur for the Brooklyn College student
F25 1590 12    after college rather than during the four school years.
F25 1600  9       Brooklyn College is Marjorie Morningstar territory,
F25 1610  6    as much as the Bronx or Central Park West. There are
F25 1620  6    hordes of nubile young women there who, prodded by
F25 1630  4    their impatient mothers, are determined to marry. It
F25 1640  2    is interesting that, although the percentage of married
F25 1640 10    students is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than
F25 1650  8    elsewhere- about 30 per cent of the women and 25 per
F25 1660  8    cent of the men in the graduating class- the anxiety
F25 1670  5    of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate. "Almost
F25 1680  1    everybody in the senior class is married", students
F25 1680  9    say dogmatically. And the school newspaper sells space
F25 1690  7    to jubilant fraternities, sororities, and houses (in
F25 1700  4    the House Plan Association) that have good news to
F25 1710  3    impart. These announcements are, in effect, advertisements
F25 1720  1    for themselves as thriving marriage marts. There are
F25 1720  9    boxed proclamations in the newspaper of watchings,
F25 1730  6    pinnings, ringings, engagements, and marriages in a
F25 1740  4    scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity. "Witt House
F25 1750  1    happily announces the engagement of Fran Horowitz to
F25 1750  9    Erwin Schwartz of Fife House".
F25 1760  4       The Brooklyn College student shows some striking
F25 1770  3    departures from prevailing collegiate models. The Ivy
F25 1780  1    League enjoys no easy dominion here, and the boys are
F25 1780 11    as likely to dress in rather foppish Continental fashion,
F25 1790  7    or even in nondescript working class manner, as they
F25 1800  6    are in the restrained, button-down Ivy way. The girls
F25 1810  4    are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their
F25 1810 13    counterparts out of town, and eye shadow, mascara,
F25 1820  8    and elaborate bouffant hairdos- despite the admonitions
F25 1830  4    of cautious guidance personnel- are not unknown even
F25 1840  7    in early morning classes.
F25 1840 11       Among the boys, there is very little bravado about
F25 1850  8    drinking. Brooklyn College is distinctive for not having
F25 1860  6    an official drinking place. The Fort Lauderdale encampment
F25 1870  2    for drinking is foreign to most Brooklyn College boys.
F26 0010  1    This should be used frequently (but shaken before using).
F26 0010 10    For galled breasts, the mother should shave into half
F26 0020  8    a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to
F26 0030  5    make a paste. This could also be used for any other
F26 0040  2    skin irritation. Or she might place cornstarch in the
F26 0040 11    oven for a short time and then apply this under her
F26 0050 10    breasts.
F26 0050 11       "Female troubles" of various kinds do not seem to
F26 0060  9    have been common on the frontier; at least I have only
F26 0070  7    one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection,
F26 0080  4    one for hastening delayed menstruation. The sufferer
F26 0090  1    drinks tansy tea.
F26 0090  4       Bruises, burns, cuts, etc&, occurred frequently
F26 0100  1    on the frontier, and folk medicine gave the answers
F26 0100 10    to these problems too. Bruises and black eyes were
F26 0110  8    relieved by application of raw beefsteak. (Doctors
F26 0120  4    now say that it was not the meat but the coolness of
F26 0130  2    the applications which relieved the pain.) Salted butter
F26 0130 10    was another cure for bruises. Many people agreed that
F26 0150  8    burns should be treated with bland oily salves or unsalted
F26 0160  7    butter or lard, but one informant told me that a burn
F26 0170  6    should be bathed in salt water; the burn oozed watery
F26 0180  2    fluid for many days, and finally the healing was completed
F26 0180 12    by bathing it with epsom salts. Another swore by vinegar
F26 0190 10    baths for burns, and still another recommended salted
F26 0200  6    butter. "Butter salve" or "butter ointment" was used
F26 0210  5    for burns, and for bruises as well. This was made by
F26 0220  4    putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to
F26 0220 15    boil; when it was cool, the fat was skimmed off and
F26 0230 11    bottled. Cow's milk was another cure for burns, and
F26 0240  8    burns covered with gum arabic or plain mucilage healed
F26 0250  4    quickly. One man, badly burned about the face and eyes
F26 0260  2    by an arc welding torch, was blinded and could not
F26 0260 12    find a doctor at the time. A sympathetic friend made
F26 0270  8    poultices of raw potato parings, which she said was
F26 0280  5    the best and quickest way to draw out the "heat". Later
F26 0290  2    the doctor used mineral oil on the burns. The results
F26 0300  1    were good, but which treatment helped is still not
F26 0300 10    known.
F26 0300 11       To stop bleeding, cobwebs were applied to cuts and
F26 0310  9    wounds. One old-timer said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding
F26 0320  8    cut, even when on a knuckle, if it was made by a rusty
F26 0330  6    tool; this would stop the flow and also prevent infection.
F26 0340  2    My lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy
F26 0350  1    for cuts and wounds; she sprinkled common sugar directly
F26 0350 10    on the injury and then bound it loosely with cotton
F26 0360  8    cloth, over which she poured turpentine. He showed
F26 0370  4    me one of his fingers which had been practically amputated
F26 0380  2    and which his mother had treated; there is scarcely
F26 0380 11    a scar showing. Tobacco was common first aid. A "chaw"
F26 0390  9    of tobacco put on an open wound was both antiseptic
F26 0400  8    and healing. Or a thin slice of plug tobacco might
F26 0410  5    be laid on the open wound without chewing. One old
F26 0420  2    man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in
F26 0420 15    the head by a fractious mule and had his scalp laid
F26 0430  8    back from the entire front of his head. His brother
F26 0440  4    ran a mile to get the father; when they reached the
F26 0450  2    boy, the father sliced a new plug of tobacco, put the
F26 0450 13    scalp back in place, and covered the raw edges with
F26 0460  9    the slices. Then he put a rag around the dressing to
F26 0470  5    keep it in place. There was no cleaning or further
F26 0480  1    care, but the wound healed in less than two weeks and
F26 0480 12    showed no scar. Veronica from the herb garden was also
F26 0490  9    used to stop bleeding, and rue was an antiseptic. Until
F26 0500  7    quite recently, "sterile" maggots could be bought to
F26 0510  5    apply to a wound; they would feed on its surface, leaving
F26 0520  2    it clean so that it could be medically treated.
F26 0520 11       Tetanus could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine
F26 0530  8    over a wound. One family bound wounds with bacon or
F26 0540  6    salt pork strips, or, if these were not handy, plain
F26 0550  3    lard. Another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held
F26 0550 12    the wounded foot or hand in the smoke. Rabies were
F26 0560 10    cured or prevented by "madstones" which the pioneer
F26 0570  6    wore or carried. In 1872 there were known to be twenty-two
F26 0580  6    in Norton County, and one had been in the family for
F26 0590  3    200 years. Another cure for hydrophobia was to suck
F26 0590 12    the wounds, then cauterize them with a hot knife or
F26 0600  9    poker.
F26 0600 10       While nowadays we recognize the fact that there
F26 0610  7    are many causes for bleeding at the nose, not long
F26 0620  5    ago a nosebleed was simply that, and treatment had
F26 0630  1    little variation. Since a fall or blow might have caused
F26 0640 10    it, a cold pack was usually first aid. This might be
F26 0650  8    applied to the top of the nose or the back of the neck,
F26 0660  7    pressed on the upper lip, or inserted into the nostril
F26 0670  2    (cotton was usually used in this last). Nosebleed could
F26 0670 11    be stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the
F26 0680 10    patient's neck and tying in it a knot for each year
F26 0690  9    of his life. Or the victim could chew hard on a piece
F26 0700  5    of paper, meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in his
F26 0710  2    ears.
F26 0710  3       Old sores could be healed by the constant application
F26 0720  1    of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water. Blood
F26 0720 12    blisters could be prevented from forming by rubbing
F26 0730  7    a work blister immediately with any hard nonpoisonous
F26 0750  4    substance. Felons were cured by taking common salt
F26 0760  2    and drying it in the oven, pounding it fine, and mixing
F26 0760 13    it with equal parts of spirits of turpentine; this
F26 0770  7    mixture was then spread on a cloth and wrapped around
F26 0780  6    the affected part. As the cloth dried, more of the
F26 0790  3    mixture was applied, and after twenty-four hours the
F26 0790 12    felon was supposed to be "killed".
F26 0800  5       Insect bites were cured in many ways. Many an old-timer
F26 0810  6    swore by the saliva method; "get a bite, spit on it"
F26 0820  4    was a proverb. This was used also for bruises. Yellow
F26 0830  1    clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also
F26 0830 12    for swellings; not long ago "Denver Mud" was most popular.
F26 0840  9    Chiggers were a common pest along streams and where
F26 0850  7    gardens and berries thrived; so small as to be scarcely
F26 0860  6    visible to the eye, they buried themselves in the victim's
F26 0870  3    flesh. Bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave
F26 0870 11    relief and also killed the pests. Ant bites were eased
F26 0880 10    by applying liquid bluing. For mosquito bites a paste
F26 0890  7    of half a glass of salt and half a glass of soda was
F26 0900  6    made. For wasp stings onion juice, obtained by scraping
F26 0910  2    an onion, gave quick relief. A handier remedy was to
F26 0910 12    bathe the painful part in strong soapy water; mud was
F26 0920  9    sometimes used as well as soap. Just plain old black
F26 0930  7    dirt was also used as a pack to relieve wasp or bee
F26 0940  4    stings.
F26 0940  5       Bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days; to keep
F26 0950  3    them out of homes, even in the 1900's, was a chore.
F26 0950 14    Bed slats were washed in alum water, legs of beds were
F26 0960 11    placed in cups of kerosene, and all woodwork was treated
F26 0970  8    liberally with corrosive sublimate, applied with a
F26 0980  4    feather. Kerosene was very effective in ridding pioneer
F26 0990  2    homes of the pests. At times pioneer children got lice
F26 0990 12    in their hair. A kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment,
F26 1000  9    but it did the job.
F26 1010  2       To remove an insect from one's ear warm water should
F26 1020  1    be inserted. A cinder or other small object could be
F26 1020 11    removed from the eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye.
F26 1030  9    As the seed swelled its glutinous covering protected
F26 1040  3    the eyeball from irritation, and both the cinder and
F26 1050  2    the seed could soon be washed out. Another way to remove
F26 1050 13    small objects from the eye was to have the person look
F26 1060 11    cross-eyed; the particle would then move toward the
F26 1070  6    nose, where it could be wiped out with a wisp of cotton.
F26 1080  5       Shingles were cured by gentian, an old drug, used
F26 1090  2    in combinations. For erysipelas a mixture of one dram
F26 1090 11    borax and one ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted
F26 1110  8    part on linen cloth. Itching skin, considered "just
F26 1120  4    nerves", was eased by treating with whiskey and salt.
F26 1130  4    Winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider
F26 1140  1    in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped. To
F26 1140  9    cure fungus growths on mouth or hands people made a
F26 1150  8    strong tea by using a handful of sassafras bark in
F26 1160  4    a quart of water. They drank half a cup of this morning
F26 1170  1    and night, and they also washed and soaked their hands
F26 1170 11    in the same solution. Six treatments cured one case
F26 1180  7    which lasted a month and had defied other remedies.
F26 1190  5    Frostbite was treated by putting the feet and hands
F26 1200  3    in ice water or by rubbing them with snow. Now one
F26 1200 14    hears that heat and hot water are used instead. Another
F26 1210  9    remedy was oil of eucalyptus, used as well for chilblains.
F26 1220  6    Chilblains were also treated with tincture of capsicum
F26 1230  4    or cabbage leaves.
F26 1230  7       Boils have always been a source of much trouble.
F26 1240  6    A German informant gave me a sure cure made by combining
F26 1250  4    rye flour and molasses into a poultice. Another poultice
F26 1260  1    was made from the inner bark of the elm tree, steeped
F26 1260 12    in water until it formed a sticky, gummy solution.
F26 1270  8    This was also used for sores. Another frequent pioneer
F26 1280  4    difficulty, caused by wearing rough and heavy shoes
F26 1290  2    and boots, was corns. One veracious woman tells me
F26 1290 11    she has used thin potato parings for both corns and
F26 1300  9    calluses on her feet and they remove the pain or "fire".
F26 1310  6    Another common cure was to soak the feet five or ten
F26 1320  5    minutes in warm water, then to apply a solution of
F26 1330  1    equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid
F26 1330 12    bandage overnight. This softened the skin so that in
F26 1340  8    the morning when the bandage was removed the corn could
F26 1350  4    be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on.
F26 1360  1       There were many cures for warts. One young girl
F26 1360 10    told me how her mother removed a wart from her finger
F26 1370  8    by soaking a copper penny in vinegar for three days
F26 1380  5    and then painting the finger with the liquid several
F26 1390  1    times. Another wart removal method was to rub each
F26 1390 10    wart with a bean split open and then to bury the bean
F26 1400 10    halves under the drip of the house for seven days.
F26 1410  5    Saliva gathered in the mouth after a night's sleep
F26 1420  2    was considered poisonous; wetting a wart with this
F26 1420 10    saliva on wakening the first thing in the morning was
F26 1430  9    supposed to cause it to disappear after only a few
F26 1440  5    treatments, and strangely enough many warts did just
F26 1450  2    that. One wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a
F26 1450 15    blonde gypsy. Another was to soak raw beef in vinegar
F26 1460  9    for twenty-four hours, tie it on the wart, and wear
F26 1470  7    it for a week. A simpler method was to tie a thread
F26 1480  3    tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this
F26 1480 14    way. I know this worked. One person recommended to
F26 1490  8    me washing the wart with sulphur water; another said
F26 1500  5    it should be rubbed with a cut potato three times daily.
F26 1510  4    Another common method was to cut an onion in two and
F26 1520  1    place each half on the wart for a moment; the onion
F26 1520 12    was then fastened together with string and placed beneath
F26 1530  7    a dripping eave. As the onion decayed, so did the wart.
F26 1540  7       Sore muscles were relieved by an arnica rub; sore
F26 1550  5    feet by calf's-foot, an herb from the pioneer's ubiquitous
F26 1560  2    herb garden, or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot
F26 1560 14    water in which two cups of salt had been dissolved.
F26 1570 10    Leg cramps, one person tells me, were relieved by standing
F26 1580  7    barefoot with the weight of the body on the heel and
F26 1590  6    pressing down hard. This does give relief, as I can
F26 1600  2    testify. One doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey
F26 1600 10    or brandy before each meal for leg cramps. Pains in
F26 1610  9    the back of the leg and in the abdomen were prevented
F26 1620  5    from reaching the upper body by tying a rope about
F26 1630  2    the patient's waist.
F26 1630  5       For sprains and swellings, one pint of cider vinegar
F26 1640  5    and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added to three
F26 1650  3    well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief.
F27 0010  1       EXCEPT FOR the wine waiter in a restaurant- always
F27 0010 10    an inscrutable plenipotentiary unto himself, the genii
F27 0020  6    with the keys to unlock the gates of the wine world
F27 0030  7    are one's dealer, and the foreign shipper or negociant
F27 0040  3    who in turn supplies him. In instances where both of
F27 0050  3    these are persons or firms with integrity, the situation
F27 0050 12    is ideal. It may, on occasion, be anything but that.
F27 0060  9    However, by cultivating a wine dealer and accepting
F27 0070  6    his advice, one will soon enough ascertain whether
F27 0080  2    he has any knowledge of wines (as opposed to what he
F27 0080 13    may have been told by salesmen and promoters) and,
F27 0090  9    better yet, whether he has a taste for wine. Again,
F27 0100  7    by spreading one's purchases over several wine dealers,
F27 0110  3    one becomes familiar with the names and specialties
F27 0120  1    of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad. This
F27 0120  9    is important because, despite all the efforts of the
F27 0130  7    French government, an appreciable segment of France's
F27 0140  4    export trade in wines is still tainted with a misrepresentation
F27 0150  2    approaching downright dishonesty, and there are many
F27 0160  1    too many negociants who would rather turn a sou than
F27 0160 11    amass a creditable reputation overseas.
F27 0170  4       A good negociant or shipper will not only be the
F27 0180  6    man or the firm which has cornered the wines from the
F27 0190  2    best vineyards, or the best parts of them; he may also
F27 0190 13    be the one who makes and bottles the best blends- sound
F27 0200 10    wines from vineyards generally in his own district.
F27 0210  6    These are the wines the French themselves use for everyday
F27 0220  4    drinking, for even in France virtually no one drinks
F27 0230  2    the Grands Crus on a meal-to-meal basis. The Grands
F27 0240  1    Crus are expensive, and even doting palates tire of
F27 0240 10    them. And certainly, in the case of the beginner or
F27 0250  8    the comparatively uninitiated wine drinker, the palate
F27 0260  4    and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready
F27 0270  1    for the Grands Crus as a steady diet without frequent
F27 0270 11    recourse to crus of less renown. There is nothing infra
F27 0280 10    dig about a good blend from a good shipper. Some of
F27 0290  9    them are very delicious indeed, and there are many
F27 0300  5    good ones exported- unfortunately, along with others
F27 0310  2    not so good, and worse. Consultation with a reputable
F27 0310 11    wine dealer and constant experimentation- "steering
F27 0320  5    ever from the known to the unknown"- are the requisites.
F27 0330  6       Wine waiters are something else again; especially
F27 0340  4    if one is travelling or dining out a great deal, their
F27 0350  3    importance mounts. Most of them, the world over, operate
F27 0360  1    on the same principle by which justice is administered
F27 0360 10    in France and some other Latin countries: the customer
F27 0370  7    is to be considered guilty of abysmal ignorance until
F27 0380  5    proven otherwise, with the burden of proof on the customer
F27 0390  4    himself. Now the drinking of wine (and happily so!)
F27 0400  1    is for the most part a recondite affair, for manifestly,
F27 0400 11    if everyone in the world who could afford the best
F27 0410  9    wines also liked them, the supply would dry up in no
F27 0420  7    time at all. This is the only valid, and extenuating,
F27 0430  1    argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible
F27 0440  1    attitude of the common wine waiter. A really good wine
F27 0440 11    waiter is, paradoxically, the guardian (and not the
F27 0450  7    purveyor) of his cellar against the Visigoths. Faced,
F27 0460  4    on the one hand, with an always exhaustible supply
F27 0470  2    of his best wines, and on the other by a clientele
F27 0470 13    usually equipped with inexhaustible pocketbooks, it
F27 0480  5    is a wonder indeed that all wine waiters are not afflicted
F27 0490  5    with chronic ambivalence. The one way to get around
F27 0500  3    them- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking
F27 0510  1    to it- is to frequent a single establishment until
F27 0510 10    its wine waiter is persuaded that one is at least as
F27 0520  9    interested in wine as in spending money. Only then,
F27 0530  4    perhaps, will he reveal his jewels and his bargains.
F27 0540  1       Wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed
F27 0540 10    to rest for several weeks before it is served. This
F27 0550  9    is especially true of red wines, and a practice which,
F27 0560  7    though not always practicable, is well worth the effort.
F27 0570  4    It does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter
F27 0580  1    of days, but in terms of months and years it is fatal.
F27 0580 13    Wine stored for a long time should be on its side;
F27 0590 10    otherwise, the cork dries and air enters to spoil it.
F27 0600  7    When stacking wine on its side in a bin, care should
F27 0610  3    always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left
F27 0610 15    next to the cork. Fat bottles, such as Burgundies,
F27 0620  9    have a way of rolling around in the bin and often need
F27 0630  8    little props, such as a bit of cardboard or a chip
F27 0640  4    of wood, to hold them in the proper reclining posture.
F27 0650  1    Too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks, again
F27 0650 11    with ill effects. The best rule of thumb for detecting
F27 0660  8    corked wine (provided the eye has not already spotted
F27 0670  5    it) is to smell the wet end of the cork after pulling
F27 0680  2    it: if it smells of wine, the bottle is probably all
F27 0680 13    right; if it smells of cork, one has grounds for suspicion.
F27 0690 11       Seasonal rises or drops in temperature are bad for
F27 0700  9    wine: they age it prematurely. The ideal storage temperature
F27 0710  5    for long periods is about fifty-five degrees, with
F27 0720  3    an allowable range of five degrees above or below this,
F27 0730  2    provided there are no sudden or frequent changes. Prolonged
F27 0730 11    vibration is also undesirable; consequently, one's
F27 0740  6    wine closet or cellar should be away from machines
F27 0750  6    or electrically driven furnaces. If one lives near
F27 0760  4    a subway or an express parkway, the solution is to
F27 0760 14    have one's wines stored with a dealer and brought home
F27 0770 10    a few at a time. Light, especially daylight, is always
F27 0780  6    bad for wine.
F27 0780  9       All in all, though, there is a good deal of nonsense
F27 0790 10    expended over the preparations thought necessary for
F27 0800  4    ordinary wine drinking; many people go to extreme lengths
F27 0810  4    in decanting, chilling or warming, or banishing without
F27 0820  1    further investigation any bottle with so much as a
F27 0820 10    slightly suspicious cork. No one should wish to deny
F27 0830  8    these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from
F27 0840  4    all this, and to give fair warning where warning is
F27 0850  2    due, no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring
F27 0850 13    some degree of purism! But the fact remains that in
F27 0860  9    most restaurants, including some of the best of Paris
F27 0870  7    and Bordeaux and Dijon, the bottle is frankly and simply
F27 0880  5    brought from the cellar to the table when ordered,
F27 0890  1    and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives
F27 0890 10    takes place while the chef is preparing the meal. A
F27 0900  9    white wine, already at cool cellar temperature, may
F27 0910  4    be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water
F27 0920  2    or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator (the
F27 0920 10    former is far preferable) in about fifteen minutes;
F27 0930  6    for those who live in a winter climate, there is nothing
F27 0940  5    better than a bucket of water and snow. Though by no
F27 0950  3    means an ideal procedure, a red wine may similarly
F27 0950 12    be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened
F27 0960 10    twenty minutes or so before serving time. It may be
F27 0970  7    a bit cold when poured; but again, as one will have
F27 0980  5    observed at any restaurant worth its salt, wine should
F27 0990  1    be served in a large, tulip-shaped glass, which is
F27 0990 11    never filled more than half full. In this way, red
F27 1000  8    wine warms of itself quite rapidly- and though it is
F27 1010  7    true that it may not attain its potential of taste
F27 1020  1    and fragrance until after the middle of the meal (or
F27 1020 11    the course), in the meantime it will have run the gamut
F27 1030  9    of many beguiling and interesting stages. The only
F27 1040  4    cardinal sin which may be committed in warming a wine
F27 1050  3    is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in
F27 1050 16    front of an open fire. This invariably effaces any
F27 1060  7    wine's character, and drives its fragrance underground.
F27 1070  4       It should not be forgotten that wines mature fastest
F27 1080  4    in half-bottles, less fast in full bottles, slowly
F27 1090  1    in Magnums- and slower yet in Tregnums, double Magnums,
F27 1090 10    Jeroboams, Methuselahs, and Imperiales, respectively.
F27 1100  5    Very old red wines often require several hours of aeration,
F27 1110  7    and any red wine, brought from the cellar within half
F27 1120  5    an hour of mealtime, should be uncorked and allowed
F27 1130  1    some air. But white wines never! White wines should
F27 1130 10    be opened when served, having been previously chilled
F27 1140  7    in proportion to their sweetness. Thus, Sauternes or
F27 1150  5    Barsacs should be very cold; a Pouilly-Fuisse or a
F27 1160  3    Chablis somewhat less cold. Over-chilling is an accepted
F27 1170  1    method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or
F27 1170 12    poor white wine, especially a dry wine- and certainly
F27 1180  8    less of a crime than serving a wine at a temperature
F27 1190  6    which reveals it as unattractive.
F27 1200  1       The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die
F27 1200 11    a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is
F27 1210  9    exposed for long to the air. To quote Professor Saintsbury:
F27 1220  3    "The last glass of claret or Burgundy is as good as
F27 1230  5    the first; but the first glass of Chateau d'Yquem or
F27 1240  2    Montrachet is a great deal better than the last"! This
F27 1240 12    does not mean, though, that a red wine improves with
F27 1250  9    prolonged aeration: there is a reasonable limit- and
F27 1260  6    wines kept over to the next meal or the next day, after
F27 1270  5    they have once been opened, are never as good. If this
F27 1280  2    must be done, they should always be corked and kept
F27 1280 12    in a cool place; it should be remembered that their
F27 1290  7    lasting qualities are appreciably shorter than those
F27 1300  4    of milk.
F27 1300  6       A few red wines, notably those of the Beaujolais,
F27 1310  4    are better consumed at cellar temperature. By tradition,
F27 1320  2    a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature-
F27 1330  3    if anything a little cooler- and be aged enough for
F27 1330 13    the tannin and acids to have worked out and the sediment
F27 1340 10    have settled well. Thus, red wine must, if possible,
F27 1350  6    never be disturbed or shaken; very old red wine is
F27 1360  4    often decanted so that the puckering, bitter elements
F27 1360 12    which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled
F27 1370 10    with the wine itself. A tug-of-war between an old bottle
F27 1380  9    and an inefficient corkscrew may do as much harm as
F27 1390  6    a week at sea. The cork should be pulled gradually
F27 1400  1    and smoothly, and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward.
F27 1400 11       Many people use wicker cradles for old red wine,
F27 1410  9    lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the
F27 1420  6    cradle and eventually to the table, without disturbing
F27 1430  2    the sediment. Another school frowns on such a shortcut,
F27 1430 11    and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine
F27 1440 11    should first stand on end for several days to allow
F27 1450  8    the sediment to roll to the very bottom, after which
F27 1460  3    the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position
F27 1470  1    on its side in the cradle.
F27 1470  7       In France, when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant
F27 1480  4    and serve truly fine old red wines, one visits the
F27 1490  1    restaurant well ahead of time, chooses the wines and,
F27 1490 10    with the advice of the manager and his chef, builds
F27 1500  8    the menu around them. The wine waiter will see to it
F27 1510  6    that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened
F27 1520  1    at least in time to warm and aerate, preferably allowed
F27 1520 11    to stand on end for as long as possible and, perhaps
F27 1530  9    in the case of very old wines, be decanted. Decanting
F27 1540  4    old wine aerates it fully; it may also be- practically
F27 1550  4    speaking- a matter of good economy. For, in the process
F27 1560  1    of decanting, the bottle is only tilted once instead
F27 1560 10    of several or more times at the table: hence, a minimum
F27 1570 10    of the undesirable mixture of wine and dregs.
F27 1580  5       Though there are many exceptions, which we have
F27 1590  3    noted in preceding pages, white wine is as a rule best
F27 1590 14    consumed between two and six years old, and red wines,
F27 1600 10    nowadays, between three and ten. Red wines of good
F27 1610  7    years tend to mature later and to keep longer; the
F27 1620  3    average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite
F27 1630  1    number, red Burgundy. Some clarets do not come into
F27 1630 10    their own until they are ten or fifteen years of age,
F27 1640  9    or even more. If a red Bordeaux of a good name and
F27 1650  6    year is bitter or acid, or cloying and muddy-tasting,
F27 1660  1    leave it alone for a while. Most of the wines of Beaujolais,
F27 1660 13    on the other hand, should be drunk while very young;
F27 1670 10    and Alsatians may be.
F28 0010  1    Giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically: "Rest
F28 0010  7    assured that your accompanying Letter of Instructions
F28 0020  6    shall be in the Letter and Spirit strictly complied
F28 0030  5    with **h and most particularly in regard to that part
F28 0040  4    of them relative to the completion of your noble and
F28 0040 14    humane views".
F28 0050  2       Giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation.
F28 0060  1    The slaves appeared to be in good health and at work
F28 0060 12    under John Palfrey's overseer. An excellent crop was
F28 0070  6    expected that year. William, who lived in neighboring
F28 0080  5    St& Mary's parish, had taken charge and decided that
F28 0090  3    it would be best for all if the plantation were operated
F28 0100  1    for another year. Giffen advised acceptance of this
F28 0100  9    plan, citing the depressed market for land then prevailing
F28 0110  7    and the large stock of provisions at the plantation.
F28 0120  4    If sold then, the land and improvements might bring
F28 0130  2    only $5,000. Early in January, 1844 he had a conference
F28 0130 12    with Henry and William in New Orleans, and upon learning
F28 0140 10    of Gorham's intention, Henry remonstrated calmly but
F28 0150  6    firmly with his brother. The emancipation plan would
F28 0160  5    not only be injurious to all the heirs, he contended,
F28 0170  3    but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless
F28 0180  1    Negroes. They were not capable of supporting themselves
F28 0180  9    off the plantation, and Louisiana law required their
F28 0190  6    removal from the state. Gorham refused to accept money
F28 0200  5    for slave property, but did he realize how much expense
F28 0210  3    and trouble the transportation of his Negroes to the
F28 0220  1    North involved? The suggestion that Giffen hire out
F28 0220  9    the slaves was not realistic, since no planter would
F28 0230  7    take the risk of having Negroes who knew they were
F28 0240  5    to be free living with his own slaves. Henry hid his
F28 0250  2    annoyance, although both he and William were furious
F28 0250 10    with their Yankee brother. William, who did not write
F28 0260  8    to Gorham, told Giffen that unless he could operate
F28 0270  6    the plantation as usual for a year, he would sue "amicably"
F28 0280  3    to protect his interests.
F28 0280  7       Palfrey was determined that his portion of the slaves
F28 0290  7    be converted to wage laborers during the transition
F28 0300  4    period before emancipation. If William wished to continue
F28 0310  3    operations for a year, why not simply leave the Negroes
F28 0320  1    undisturbed and pay them "as high wages to remain there
F28 0320 11    as are ever paid the labor of persons of their sex
F28 0330  9    + age. A disposition to exert themselves for my benefit
F28 0340  5    would perhaps be a motive with some of them **h to
F28 0350  3    come into the scheme. Their having family ties on our
F28 0350 13    plantation + the adjoining one would be a stronger
F28 0360  9    inducement". When he heard of his brothers' anger,
F28 0370  5    Palfrey was still hopeful that they could be persuaded
F28 0380  3    to accept his notion of paying wages. If not, he was
F28 0380 14    willing to accede to William's wishes in any way that
F28 0390 10    did not block his ultimate aim. William was adamant
F28 0400  7    on one point: under no circumstances would he allow
F28 0410  4    the Negroes to remain on the plantation with his and
F28 0420  2    Henry's slaves if they were told of their coming freedom.
F28 0420 12    Knowing the antipathy that existed in Louisiana against
F28 0430  8    increasing the number of free Negroes, Giffen suggested
F28 0440  7    that Palfrey bring them to Boston at once, and then
F28 0450  7    send them on to Liberia. Lacking specific instructions,
F28 0460  2    he agreed to William's condition.
F28 0460  7       In March there was a division of the slaves, and
F28 0470  9    Giffen carried out his instructions as nearly as possible.
F28 0480  5    Of the fifty-two slaves, Giffen succeeded in getting
F28 0490  3    a lot of twenty, twelve of whom were females. "I considered
F28 0500  1    that your views would be best carried out", he explained,
F28 0510  1    "by taking women whose progeny will of course be free
F28 0510 11    + more fully extend the philantrophy of Emancipation.
F28 0520  5    I have also taken the old servants of your father as
F28 0530  5    a matter of Conscience + Justice". The ages of the
F28 0540  3    slaves ranged from sixty-five, for an old house servant,
F28 0540 13    to an unnamed newborn child. If Palfrey ever had any
F28 0550 10    doubts about the wickedness of slavery, they were put
F28 0560  7    aside after he received an inventory of the slave property
F28 0570  5    he had inherited. This cold reckoning of human worth
F28 0580  2    in a legal paper, devoid of compassion or humanity,
F28 0580 11    was all he needed. Each human being, known only by
F28 0590  9    a given name, had a cash value. Old Sam's sixty-five
F28 0600  5    years had reduced his value to $150; Rose, a twelve-year-old
F28 0610  6    with child-bearing potential, was worth $400. In rejecting
F28 0620  3    any claim to the value of the slave property, Palfrey
F28 0630  1    was giving up close to $7,000.
F28 0630  7       Palfrey's brothers each received lots of sixteen
F28 0640  4    Negroes, and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed
F28 0650  1    that all lots were to be valued at $6,666.66. Thus
F28 0650 11    twenty "black souls" were to remain ignorant of their
F28 0660  8    imminent journey to the land of free men. Giffen extracted
F28 0670  6    one concession from William: the house servants could
F28 0680  3    be free at any time Gorham thought expedient.
F28 0690  1       Despite Giffen's warning, Palfrey still had plans
F28 0690  8    for freeing his slaves in Louisiana. Yet even if he
F28 0700  9    could get the necessary approval, fourteen of his Negroes
F28 0710  5    could not be manumitted without special permission.
F28 0720  2    According to state law a slave had to be at least thirty
F28 0730  1    years old before he could be freed. Palfrey petitioned
F28 0730 10    the state legislature to waive the requirement. Otherwise,
F28 0740  6    freedom would mean removal from the state in which
F28 0750  6    "as the place of their past residence from birth, or
F28 0760  3    for many years, it would **h be materially for their
F28 0760 13    advantage to be at liberty to remain". On March 11
F28 0770 10    the Louisiana legislature voted unanimously to table
F28 0780  5    the petition. News of the legislative veto appeared
F28 0790  3    in the New Orleans papers, and Henry and William became
F28 0800  2    incensed by the fact that they had not been told of
F28 0800 13    the attempt in advance. Henry stormed into Giffen's
F28 0810  7    office waving a copy of the New Orleans Courier, shouting
F28 0820  6    that the emancipation scheme had become a public affair,
F28 0830  6    and that it would reach the "Ears of the People on
F28 0840  3    the Plantation, and make them restless + unhappy".
F28 0840 11       His brothers' anger caused Palfrey genuine concern,
F28 0850  8    for he had imposed a dual mission upon himself: to
F28 0860  8    free his slaves, and to keep the family from falling
F28 0870  5    apart over the issue. When Giffen decided to charge
F28 0880  3    him interest on the loan from John Palfrey, Gorham
F28 0880 12    readily assented, vowing that in a matter of dollars
F28 0890  9    and cents, his brothers would never have any cause
F28 0900  6    to complain of him.
F28 0900 10       in view of these difficulties, Palfrey decided to
F28 0910  5    go to Louisiana. Giffen had already urged him to journey
F28 0920  5    south, if only for a few days to clear up matters.
F28 0930  1    His duties as Massachusetts Secretary of State obliged
F28 0930  9    him to wait until the adjournment of the legislature
F28 0940  9    in mid-April. Palfrey told his wife of his intentions
F28 0950  7    for the first time, and left for New Orleans apprehensively
F28 0960  3    invoking a special blessing of Providence that he might
F28 0970  4    be allowed to see his family again.
F28 0970 11       During his journey Palfrey stopped off to see two
F28 0980  7    abolitionists. In both cases he desired information
F28 0990  3    about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived
F28 1000  1    in the North. In New York, Lydia Maria Child welcomed
F28 1000 11    him enthusiastically: "I have lately heard of you from
F28 1010  9    the Legislature of Louisiana, and felt joy at your
F28 1020  8    public recognition of the brotherhood of man". Mrs&
F28 1030  4    Child, who had once apologized for sending editor Palfrey
F28 1040  3    a book on slavery, now confided that she had helped
F28 1040 13    one of Henry Palfrey's slaves escape to Canada some
F28 1050  9    years before, but asked him not to advertise the fact
F28 1060  9    in Louisiana. She agreed to take charge of five or
F28 1070  6    six of the Negroes should Palfrey decide to send them
F28 1080  2    north immediately. At Lexington, Kentucky, Palfrey
F28 1080  8    consulted with Cassius M& Clay on the same subject,
F28 1090  9    but with no apparent result.
F28 1100  2       Despite his apprehensions about his personal safety,
F28 1110  1    Palfrey's reception in New Orleans was more than cordial.
F28 1110 10    Instead of the expected "annoyances" due to the nature
F28 1120  9    of his mission, he received many calling cards and
F28 1130  7    invitations from "gentlemen of mark, on whom I had
F28 1140  5    no sort of claim, + have had many more invitations
F28 1150  1    than I could accept". He later told abolitionist Edmund
F28 1150 10    Quincy of the "marked attention and civility" with
F28 1160  7    which the New Orleans gentlemen and the upriver planters
F28 1170  6    greeted him. The memory of this southern hospitality
F28 1180  2    did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years
F28 1190  1    and Civil War. Palfrey's autobiography contains a melodramatic
F28 1200  1    account of two perilous days spent among the planters
F28 1200 10    of Attakapas, "many of whom were coarse + passionate
F28 1210  8    people, much excited by what they heard of my plans".
F28 1220  6    He proceeded with his task bravely- in his memoirs,
F28 1230  3    at least- before the "passions of my neighbors should
F28 1240  1    have time to boil too high".
F28 1240  7       Palfrey had already made up his mind that he would
F28 1250  5    allow the men, but not the women, to choose freely
F28 1260  1    whether or not to go North for freedom. The women by
F28 1260 12    remaining behind condemned their children, born and
F28 1270  6    unborn, to bondage. He had a short private talk with
F28 1280  5    each adult slave. Only one objected, but Palfrey soon
F28 1290  2    convinced him that he ought to go with the others.
F28 1290 12    All the slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed
F28 1300  9    to delay their departure until the end of the planting
F28 1310  7    season, so that they could get in "their own little
F28 1320  3    produce". Palfrey agreed; the slaves were to remain
F28 1330  1    as wage laborers for his account. William's threat
F28 1330  9    that under no conditions would he allow "freedom-conscious"
F28 1340  8    slaves to mix with his own was not carried out, for
F28 1350  8    the plantation continued in operation as before. Palfrey
F28 1360  4    returned to Massachusetts greatly relieved to have
F28 1370  2    made an arrangement "so satisfactory to my judgment
F28 1370 10    + my conscience".
F28 1380  1       From Cambridge, Palfrey maintained a close interest
F28 1390  1    in the welfare of his slaves. In fact, as the time
F28 1390 12    for their departure approached, his solicitousness
F28 1400  4    increased. Should any slave change his mind and request
F28 1410  5    to leave earlier, Giffen was to provide passage at
F28 1420  2    once. When a sailing date of March, 1845 was finally
F28 1430  1    established, Palfrey made sure that the Negroes would
F28 1440  8    have comfortable quarters in New Orleans and aboard
F28 1450  6    ship. Giffen assured him that the captain and his mate
F28 1460  4    had personally promised to treat the Negroes with consideration.
F28 1470  1    Palfrey was also concerned about the question of what
F28 1470 10    wage to pay for their labor throughout 1844. The plantation
F28 1480 10    was sold in January, 1845, and Palfrey thought the
F28 1490  6    new owner ought to pay his people two months' wages.
F28 1500  4    Giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation
F28 1510  1    for a year's work; the new owner at Attakapas declined
F28 1510 11    to enter into any philanthropic arrangement.
F28 1520  6       On March 21, 1845 the bark Bashaw weighed anchor
F28 1530  5    at New Orleans, while on the levee Henry and William
F28 1540  4    Palfrey waved farewell to their father's former chattels
F28 1550  2    who must have looked back at the receding shore with
F28 1550 12    mingled regret and jubilation.
F28 1560  4       Not all of Palfrey's slaves were aboard the Bashaw.
F28 1570  4    Giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult
F28 1580  1    to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants.
F28 1580 10    Two of these were included in Palfrey's lot. Giffen
F28 1590  8    filed a petition for permission to emancipate four
F28 1600  5    slaves (all more than fifty years old) with the St&
F28 1610  4    Martin's Parish Police Jury. After an initial rejection,
F28 1620  1    which he attributed to a "general Excitement against
F28 1620  9    Abolition and Emancipation", Giffen bribed the right
F28 1630  7    individuals on the jury, and got the permission without
F28 1640  7    further delay.
F28 1640  9       When the Negroes landed at Boston a month later
F28 1650  8    they were, of course, no longer slaves. Slavery was
F28 1660  4    prohibited in Massachusetts by the terms of the constitution
F28 1670  3    of 1780, which declared "all men are born free and
F28 1680  1    equal". Nevertheless, Palfrey arranged a religious
F28 1680  7    ceremony at King's Chapel to formalize the emancipation.
F28 1690  6    An eyewitness recalled how awkward the red-turbaned
F28 1700  6    colored women appeared as they curtseyed in the church
F28 1710  4    doorway, and the diffidence the former slaves displayed
F28 1720  1    while they listened to the few words that declared
F28 1720 10    them free.
F28 1730  1       Once the question of emancipation was settled to
F28 1730  9    Palfrey's satisfaction, he faced a real problem in
F28 1740  7    placing the freedmen in suitable homes as servants.
F28 1750  3    Palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a Negro boy in the
F28 1760  2    Hopedale Community, but he had better luck in his other
F28 1760 12    attempts. Mrs& Child, true to her word, helped place
F28 1770  9    Anna and her four children with a Quaker family named
F28 1780  3    Hathaway near Canandaigua, New York. This group had
F28 1790  4    been Palfrey's greatest worry since Anna was in bad
F28 1800  3    health, and her children were too young to work for
F28 1800 13    their keep.
F29 0010  1       But certainly the New Frontier has brought to Washington
F29 0010 10    a group more varied in background and interest. Secretary
F29 0020  9    of State Dean Rusk, a former Rhodes Scholar and Mills
F29 0030  8    College dean, has headed the Rockefeller Foundation
F29 0040  4    and in that role expended large sums for international
F29 0050  2    cultural exchange. One of his initial acts in office
F29 0060  1    was to appoint Philip Coombs of the Ford Foundation
F29 0060 10    as the first Assistant Secretary of State for Educational
F29 0070  7    and Cultural Affairs. ("In the late forties and fifties",
F29 0080  7    Coombs has declared in defining his role, "two strong
F29 0090  5    new arms were added to reinforce United States foreign
F29 0100  3    policy **h economic assistance and military assistance.
F29 0110  1    As we embark upon the sixties we have an opportunity
F29 0110 11    **h to build a third strong arm, aimed at the development
F29 0120  9    of people, at the fuller realization of their creative
F29 0130  5    human potential, and at better understanding among
F29 0140  2    them".)
F29 0140  3       Many of the new appointees are art collectors.
F29 0150  1    Ambassador-at-Large
F29 0150  4    Averell Harriman has returned to the capital with a
F29 0160  3    collection of paintings that include Renoir, Cezanne,
F29 0160 10    Gauguin, Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas, Matisse,
F29 0170  7    Picasso, and Walt Kuhn. The Director of the Peace Corps,
F29 0180  9    R& Sargent Shriver, Jr&, a Kennedy brother-in-law,
F29 0190  7    collects heavily among the moderns, including Kenzo
F29 0200  3    Okada and Josef Albers. Secretary of the Treasury Douglas
F29 0210  2    Dillon owns a prize Monet, Femmes dans un jardin.
F29 0220  1       Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, former President
F29 0230  1    of the Ford Motor Company, comes from a generation
F29 0230 10    different from that of Eisenhower's own first Secretary
F29 0240  7    of Defense, Charles Wilson, who had been head of General
F29 0250  7    Motors. Unlike Wilson, who at times seemed almost
F29 0260  4    anti-intellectual
F29 0260  6    in his earthy pragmatism. McNamara is the scholar-businessman.
F29 0270  5    An inveterate reader of books, he chose while working
F29 0280  3    in Detroit to live in the University community of Ann
F29 0290  2    Arbor, almost forty miles away. He selected as Comptroller
F29 0290 11    of Defense, not a veteran accountant, but a former
F29 0300  9    Rhodes Scholar, Charles Hitch, who is author of a study
F29 0310  8    on The Economics of Defense in the Nuclear Age.
F29 0320  5       One of the President's special assistants, the Harvard
F29 0330  3    dean McGeorge Bundy, was co-author with Henry L& Stimson
F29 0340  3    of the latter's classic memoir, On Active Service.
F29 0350  1    Another, Arthur M& Schlesinger, Jr&, has won a Pulitzer
F29 0360  1    Prize in history; his wife, Marion, is a portrait painter.
F29 0360 11    The Press Secretary, Pierre Salinger, was a child prodigy
F29 0370  9    as a pianist. ("It is always of sorrow to me when I
F29 0380 10    find people who **h neither know nor understand music",
F29 0390  5    he declared not long ago in proposing that White House
F29 0400  4    prizes be awarded for music and art.) Mrs& Arthur Goldberg,
F29 0410  2    wife of the Secretary of Labor, paints professionally
F29 0420  1    and helps sponsor the Associated Artists' Gallery in
F29 0420  9    the District of Columbia. ("Artists are always at a
F29 0430  8    new frontier", she claims. "In fact, the search is
F29 0440  6    almost more important than the find".) Mrs& Henry Labouisse,
F29 0450  4    wife of the new director of the foreign aid program,
F29 0460  3    is the writer and lecturer Eve Curie.
F29 0460 10       The list goes on. At last count, sixteen former
F29 0470  8    Rhodes Scholars (see box on page 13) had been appointed
F29 0480  6    to the Administration, second in number only to its
F29 0490  4    Harvard graduates. Besides Schlesinger, the Justice
F29 0490 10    Department's Information Director, Edwin Guthman, has
F29 0500  6    won a Pulitzer Prize (for national reporting). Postmaster
F29 0510  6    General J& Edward Day, who must deal with matters of
F29 0520  8    postal censorship, is himself author of a novel, Bartholf
F29 0530  6    Street, albeit one he was obliged to publish at his
F29 0550  3    own expense.
F29 0550  5       Two men show promise of playing prominent roles:
F29 0560  2       William Walton, a writer-turned-painter, has been
F29 0570  2    a long-time friend of the President. They arrived in
F29 0570 12    Washington about the same time during the early postwar
F29 0580  9    years: Kennedy as the young Congressman from Massachusetts;
F29 0590  5    Walton, after a wartime stint with Time-Life, to become
F29 0600  6    bureau chief for the New Republic. Both lived in Georgetown,
F29 0610  5    were unattached, and shared an active social life.
F29 0620  3    Walton, who soon made a break from journalism to become
F29 0630  1    one of the capital's leading semi-abstract painters,
F29 0630  9    vows that he and Kennedy never once discussed art in
F29 0640  8    those days. Nonetheless, they found common interests.
F29 0650  4    During last year's campaign, Kennedy asked Walton,
F29 0660  2    an utter novice in organization politics, to assist
F29 0660 10    him. Walton dropped everything to serve as a district
F29 0670  9    co-ordinator in the hard-fought Wisconsin primary and
F29 0680  6    proved so useful that he was promoted to be liaison
F29 0690  4    officer to critically important New York City.
F29 0700  1       Walton, who served as a correspondent with General
F29 0700  9    James Gavin's paratroopers during the invasion of France,
F29 0710  7    combines the soul of an artist with the lingo of a
F29 0720  9    tough guy. He provoked outraged editorials when, after
F29 0730  3    a post-Inaugural inspection of the White House with
F29 0740  2    Mrs& Kennedy, he remarked to reporters, "We just cased
F29 0740 11    the joint to see what was there". But his credentials
F29 0750 10    are impeccable. Already the President and the First
F29 0760  7    Lady have deputized him to advise on matters ranging
F29 0770  4    from the furnishing of the White House to the renovation
F29 0780  2    of Lafayette Square. A man of great talent, he will
F29 0780 12    continue to serve as a sort of Presidential trouble-shooter,
F29 0790 10    strictly ex officio, for culture.
F29 0800  4       A more official representative is the Secretary
F29 0810  1    of the Interior. Udall, who comes from one of the Mormon
F29 0820  1    first-families of Arizona, is a bluff, plain-spoken
F29 0820 10    man with a lust for politics and a habit of landing
F29 0830  8    right in the middle of the fight. But even while sparring
F29 0840  5    furiously with Republican politicians, he displays
F29 0850  1    a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural
F29 0850 10    attainments. His private dining room has become a way
F29 0860  9    station for visiting intellectuals such as C& P& Snow,
F29 0870  6    Arnold Toynbee, and Aaron Copland.
F29 0880  1       Udall argues that Interior affairs should cover
F29 0880  8    a great deal more than dams and wildlife preserves.
F29 0890  8    After promoting Frost's appearance at the Inauguration,
F29 0900  5    he persuaded the poet to return several months later
F29 0910  4    to give a reading to a select audience of Cabinet members,
F29 0920  2    members of Congress, and other Washington notables
F29 0920  9    gathered in the State Department auditorium. The event
F29 0930  8    was so successful that the Interior Secretary plans
F29 0940  6    to serve as impresario for similar ones from time to
F29 0950  5    time, hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment
F29 0960  1    of the Administration.
F29 0960  4       His Ideas in this respect, however, sometimes arouse
F29 0970  3    critical response. One tempest was stirred up last
F29 0980  1    March when Udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot
F29 0980 12    bronze statue of William Jennings Bryan, sculpted by
F29 0990  7    the late Gutzon Borglum, would be sent "on indefinite
F29 1000  6    loan" to Salem, Illinois, Bryan's birthplace. Spokesmen
F29 1010  3    for the nation's tradition-minded sculptors promptly
F29 1020  2    claimed that Udall was exiling the statue because of
F29 1020 11    his own hostility to this art form. They dug up a speech
F29 1030 12    he had made two years earlier as a Congressman, decrying
F29 1040  7    the more than two hundred statues, monuments, and memorials
F29 1050  5    which "dot the Washington landscape **h as patriotic
F29 1060  4    societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching
F29 1070  1    new plans". Hoping to cut down on such works, Udall
F29 1070 11    had proposed that a politician be at least fifty years
F29 1080  9    departed before he is memorialized.
F29 1090  1       He is not likely to win this battle easily. In the
F29 1100  1    case of the Borglum statue an Interior aide was obliged
F29 1100 11    to announce that there had been a misunderstanding
F29 1110  7    and that the Secretary had no desire to "hustle" it
F29 1120  5    out of Washington. The last Congress adopted seven
F29 1130  2    bills for memorials, including one to Taras Shevchenko,
F29 1140  1    the Ukrainian poet laureate; eleven others were introduced.
F29 1140  9    Active warfare is raging between the forces pressing
F29 1150  8    for a monument to the first Roosevelt on Theodore Roosevelt
F29 1160  5    Island in the Potomac, and T& R&'s own living children,
F29 1170  5    who wish to preserve the island as a wildlife sanctuary.
F29 1180  4    The hotly debated plan for the capital's Franklin D&
F29 1190  2    Roosevelt Memorial, a circle of huge tablets engraved
F29 1190 10    with his speeches (and promptly dubbed by one of its
F29 1200 10    critics, "Instant Stonehenge"), is another of Udall's
F29 1210  6    headaches, since as supervisor of the National Parks
F29 1220  5    Commission he will share in the responsibility for
F29 1230  2    building it.
F29 1230  4       "Washington", President Kennedy has been heard to
F29 1240  5    remark ironically, "is a city of southern efficiency
F29 1250  1    and northern charm". There have been indications that
F29 1250  9    he hopes to redress that situation, commencing with
F29 1260  7    the White House. One of Mrs& Kennedy's initial concerns
F29 1270  5    as First Lady was the sad state of the furnishings
F29 1280  4    in a building which is supposed to be a national shrine.
F29 1290  2    Ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful
F29 1290 11    furniture assembled by President Thomas Jefferson,
F29 1300  6    the White House has collected a hodgepodge of period
F29 1310  5    pieces, few of them authentic or aesthetic.
F29 1320  1       Mrs& Kennedy shows a determination to change all
F29 1320  9    this. Not long after moving in she turned up a richly
F29 1330 11    carved desk, hewed from the timbers of the British
F29 1340  6    ship H&M&S& Resolute and presented to President Hayes
F29 1350  3    by Queen Victoria. It now serves the President in his
F29 1360  3    oval office. Later, browsing in an old issue of the
F29 1370  1    Gazette des Beaux-Arts, she found a description of
F29 1370 10    a handsome gilt pier-table purchased in 1817 by President
F29 1380  8    James Monroe. She traced it to a storage room. With
F29 1390  7    its coating of gold radiator paint removed- a gaucherie
F29 1400  5    of some earlier tenant- it will now occupy its rightful
F29 1410  2    place in the oval Blue Room on the first floor of the
F29 1410 14    White House.
F29 1420  2       But it soon became clear that the search for
F29 1420 11    eighteenth-century
F29 1430  1    furniture (which Mrs& Kennedy feels is the proper period
F29 1440  1    for the White House) must be pursued in places other
F29 1450 10    than government storage rooms. The First Lady appointed
F29 1470  5    a Fine Arts Advisory Committee for the White House,
F29 1480  5    to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange ways
F29 1490  2    to acquire them. Her effort to put the home of living
F29 1490 13    Presidents on the same basis as Mount Vernon and Monticello
F29 1500 10    recognizes no party lines. By rough estimate her Committee,
F29 1510  9    headed by Henry Francis Du Pont, contains three times
F29 1520  7    as many Republicans as Democrats.
F29 1530  1       The press releases emanating from the White House
F29 1530  9    give a clue to the activity within. A curator has been
F29 1540 11    appointed. A valuable pencil-and-sepia allegorical
F29 1550  5    drawing of Benjamin Franklin by Jean-Honore Fragonard
F29 1560  2    has been donated by the art dealer Georges Wildenstein
F29 1570  1    and now hangs in the Blue Room. The American Institute
F29 1580  1    of Interior Designers is redecorating the White House
F29 1580  9    library. Secretary and Mrs& Dillon have contributed
F29 1590  6    enough pieces of Empire furniture, including Dolley
F29 1600  4    Madison's own sofa, to furnish a room in that style.
F29 1610  4    And part of a fabulous collection of vermeil hollowware,
F29 1620  1    bequeathed to the White House by the late Mrs& Margaret
F29 1630  1    Thompson Biddle, has been taken out of its locked cases
F29 1630 11    and put on display in the State dining room.
F29 1640  6       Woman's place is in the home: man must attend to
F29 1650  5    matters of the yard. One of the vexatious problems
F29 1660  1    to first confront President Kennedy was the property
F29 1660  9    lying just across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White
F29 1670  7    House. Congress had already appropriated money, and
F29 1680  5    plans were well along to tear down the buildings flanking
F29 1690  3    Lafayette Square and replace them with what one critic
F29 1700  2    calls the "marble monumentality" of government office
F29 1700  9    buildings. While a Senator, Kennedy had unsuccessfully
F29 1710  7    pushed a bill to preserve the Belasco Theater, as well
F29 1720  7    as the Dolley Madison and the Benjamin Taylor houses,
F29 1730  4    all scheduled for razing.
F29 1730  8       What to do about it now that he was President? Only
F29 1740 10    a few days after moving into the White House. Kennedy
F29 1750  6    made a midnight inspection of the Square. Then he called
F29 1760  4    in his friend Walton and turned over the problem to
F29 1770  2    him, with instructions to work out what was best- provided
F29 1770 12    it didn't pile unnecessary burdens on the President.
F29 1780  8       The situation involved some political perils. One
F29 1790  6    of the offices slated for reconstruction is the aged
F29 1800  4    Court of Claims, diagonally across the street from
F29 1810  2    the White House. Logically, it should be moved downtown.
F29 1810 11    But Judge Marvin Jones, senior member of the Court,
F29 1820  9    is an elderly gentleman who lives at the nearby Metropolitan
F29 1830  8    Club and desires to walk to work. More importantly,
F29 1840  5    he also happens to be the brother-in-law of Sam Rayburn,
F29 1850  4    Speaker of the House.
F29 1850  8       There were aesthetic problems as well as political.
F29 1860  6    On delving deeper, Walton discovered that most of the
F29 1870  5    buildings fronting the Square could be classified as
F29 1880  2    "early nondescript". The old Belasco Theater, over
F29 1880  9    which many people had grown sentimental, was only a
F29 1890  8    shell of its former self after arduous years as a ~USO
F29 1900  7    Center. The Dolley Madison House, Walton concluded,
F29 1910  3    was scarcely worth preserving. "The attempt to save
F29 1920  3    the Square's historic value", he declares, "came half
F29 1920 11    a century too late".
F30 0010  1    Surrounded by ancient elms, the campus is spacious
F30 0010  9    and beautiful. The buildings are mostly Georgian. The
F30 0020  6    Dartmouth student does not live in monastic seclusion,
F30 0030  4    as he once did. But his is still a simple life relatively
F30 0040  2    free of the female presence or influence, and he must
F30 0040 12    go far, even though he may go fast, for sophisticated
F30 0050 10    pleasures. He is still heir to the rare gifts of space
F30 0060  9    and silence, if he chooses to be.
F30 0070  1       He is by no means the country boy he might have
F30 0070 12    been in the last century, down from the hills with
F30 0080  8    bear grease on his hair and a zeal for book learning
F30 0090  4    in his heart. The men's shops on Hanover's Main Street
F30 0100  3    compare favorably with those in Princeton and New Haven.
F30 0110  1    And the automobiles that stream out of Hanover each
F30 0110 10    weekend, toward Smith and Wellesley and Mount Holyoke,
F30 0120  8    are no less rakish than those leaving Cambridge or
F30 0130  5    West Philadelphia. But there has always been an outdoor
F30 0140  5    air to Dartmouth. The would-be sophisticate and the
F30 0150  3    citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment.
F30 0150 10    No one here pokes fun at manly virtues. And this gives
F30 0160 10    rise to an easy camaraderie probably unequaled elsewhere
F30 0170  4    in the Ivy League. It even affects the faculty.
F30 0180  3       Thus, when Dartmouth's Winter Carnival- widely recognized
F30 0190  5    as the greatest, wildest, roaringest college weekend
F30 0200  1    anywhere, any time- was broadcast over a national television
F30 0200 10    hookup, Prexy John Sloan Dickey appeared on the screen
F30 0210  9    in rugged winter garb, topped off by a tam-o'-shanter
F30 0220  9    which he confessed had been acquired from a Smith girl.
F30 0230  6    President Dickey's golden retriever, frolicking in
F30 0240  3    the snow at his feet, added to the picture of masculine
F30 0250  1    informality.
F30 0250  2       This carefree disdain for "side" cropped up again
F30 0260  2    in the same television broadcast. Dean Thaddeus Seymour,
F30 0260 10    wearing ski clothes, was crowning a beauteous damsel
F30 0270  8    queen of the Carnival. She must have looked temptingly
F30 0280  6    pretty to the dean as he put the crown on her head.
F30 0290  4    So he kissed her. No Dartmouth man was surprised.
F30 0300  1       Dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions
F30 0300  7    with equal sang-froid. For example, groups regularly
F30 0310  7    canoe down the Connecticut River. This is in honor
F30 0330  6    of John Ledyard, class of 1773, who scooped a canoe
F30 0340  3    out of a handy tree and first set the course way back
F30 0340 15    in his own student days. And these hardy travelers
F30 0350  9    are not unappreciated today. They are hailed by the
F30 0360  7    nation's press, and Smith girls throng the riverbanks
F30 0370  3    at Northampton and refresh the voyageurs with hot soup
F30 0380  3    and kisses.
F30 0380  5       Dartmouth's favorite and most characteristic recreation
F30 0390  2    is skiing. Since the days when their two thousand pairs
F30 0400  2    of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in
F30 0400 10    the United States, the students have stopped regarding
F30 0410  7    the Olympic Ski Team as another name for their own.
F30 0420  7    Yet Dartmouth still is the dominant member of the Intercollegiate
F30 0430  5    Ski Union, which includes the winter sports colleges
F30 0440  3    of Canada as well as those of this country.
F30 0440 12       Dartmouth students ski everywhere in winter, starting
F30 0450  7    with their own front door. They can hire a horse and
F30 0460  8    go ski-joring behind him, or move out to Oak Hill,
F30 0470  5    where there's a lift. The Dartmouth Skiway, at Holt's
F30 0480  3    Ledge, ten miles north of the campus, has one of the
F30 0480 14    best terrains in the East, ranging from novice to expert.
F30 0490 10       Forty miles farther north is Mount Moosilauke, Dartmouth's
F30 0500  8    own mountain. Here, at the Ravine Lodge, President
F30 0510  7    Dickey acts as host every year to about a hundred freshmen
F30 0520  7    who are being introduced by the Dartmouth Outing Club
F30 0530  3    to life on the trails. The Lodge, built of hand-hewn
F30 0540  1    virgin spruce, can handle fifty people for dining,
F30 0540  9    sleeping, or lounging in its huge living room. The
F30 0550  8    Outing Club also owns a chain of fourteen cabins and
F30 0560  5    several shelters, extending from the Vermont hills,
F30 0570  2    just across the river from the college, through Hanover
F30 0570 11    to the College Grant- 27,000 acres of wilderness 140
F30 0580  8    miles north up in the logging country. The cabins are
F30 0590  7    equipped with bunks, blankets, and cooking equipment
F30 0600  4    and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips. The
F30 0610  2    club runs regular trips to the cabins, but many of
F30 0610 12    the students prefer to take off in small unofficial
F30 0620  8    groups for a weekend of hunting, fishing, climbing,
F30 0630  3    or skiing.
F30 0630  5       Under the auspices of the Outing Club, Dartmouth
F30 0640  3    also has the Mountaineering Club, which takes on tough
F30 0650  3    climbs like Mount McKinley, and Bait + Bullet, whose
F30 0650 12    interests are self-evident, and even sports a Woodman's
F30 0660  9    Team, which competes with other New England colleges
F30 0670  7    in wood sawing and chopping, canoe races, and the like.
F30 0690  6       There is much to be said for a college that, while
F30 0700  3    happily attuned to the sophisticated Ivies, still gives
F30 0710  1    its students a chance to get up early in the morning
F30 0710 12    and drive along back roads where a glimpse of small
F30 0720  8    game, deer, or even bear is not uncommon. City boys
F30 0730  4    find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle
F30 0740  1    or in the sharp tang of a sawmill, come upon suddenly
F30 0740 12    in a backwoods logging camp. And on the summit of Mount
F30 0750  9    Washington, where thirty-five degrees below zero is
F30 0760  5    commonplace and the wind velocity has registered higher
F30 0770  2    than anywhere else in the world, there is a kind of
F30 0770 13    wisdom to be found that other men often seek in the
F30 0780 11    Himalayas "because it is there".
F30 0790  4       There is much to be said for such a college- and
F30 0800  4    Dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often
F30 0800 14    and too loudly. Their affection for their college home
F30 0810  8    has even caused President Dickey to comment on this
F30 0820  6    "place loyalty" as something rather specially Hanoverian.
F30 0830  3       Probably a lawyer once said it best for all time
F30 0840  3    in the Supreme Court of the United States. Early in
F30 0840 13    the nineteenth century the State of New Hampshire was
F30 0850  9    casting about for a way to found its own state university.
F30 0860 10    It fixed on Dartmouth College, which was ready-made
F30 0870  5    and just what the proctor ordered. The legislators
F30 0880  2    decided to "liberate" Dartmouth and entered into a
F30 0880 10    tug-o'-war with the college trustees over the control
F30 0890  8    of classrooms, faculty, and chapel. For a time there
F30 0900  7    were two factions on the campus fighting for possession
F30 0910  4    of the student body.
F30 0910  8       The struggle was resolved in 1819 in the Supreme
F30 0920  7    Court in one of the most intriguing cases in our judicial
F30 0930  5    history. In 1817 the lawyers were generally debating
F30 0940  1    the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters.
F30 0940  9    A lawyer, hired by the college, was arguing specifically
F30 0950  8    for Dartmouth: Daniel Webster, class of 1801, made
F30 0960  7    her plight the dramatic focus of his whole plea. In
F30 0970  6    an age of oratory, he was the king of orators, and
F30 0980  2    both he himself and Chief Justice Marshall were bathed
F30 0980 11    in manly tears, as Uncle Dan'l reached his thundering
F30 0990  8    climax:
F30 0990  9       "It is, sir, as I have said, a small college, and
F30 1000 11    yet there are those who love it **h".
F30 1010  5       Dartmouth is today still a small college- and still
F30 1020  5    a private one, thanks to Webster's eloquence.
F30 1020 12       This is not out of keeping with its origins, probably
F30 1030 10    the most humble of any in the Ivy group. Eleazar Wheelock,
F30 1040  8    a Presbyterian minister, founded the school in 1769,
F30 1050  6    naming it after the second earl of Dartmouth, its sponsor
F30 1060  3    and benefactor. Eleazar, pausing on the Hanover plain,
F30 1070  1    found its great forests and remoteness good and with
F30 1070 10    his own hands built the first College Hall, a log hut
F30 1080  9    dedicated "for the education + instruction of Youth
F30 1090  5    of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing
F30 1100  2    + all parts of learning which shall appear necessary
F30 1100 11    and expedient for civilizing + christianizing Children
F30 1110  7    of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences;
F30 1120  8    and also of English Youth and any others".
F30 1130  4       It was a hardy undertaking, and Wheelock's was indeed
F30 1140  3    "a voice crying in the wilderness". A road had to be
F30 1150  1    hacked through trackless forests between Hanover and
F30 1150  8    Portsmouth to permit Governor Wentworth and a company
F30 1160  7    of gentlemen to attend the first Dartmouth commencement
F30 1170  3    in 1771. The governor and his retinue thoughtfully
F30 1180  1    brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which
F30 1180  9    is still one of the cherished possessions of the college.
F30 1190  9       The exuberance on this occasion set a standard for
F30 1200  8    subsequent Dartmouth gatherings. A student orator "produced
F30 1210  5    tears from a great number of the learned" even before
F30 1220  3    the punch was served. Then from the branches of a near-by
F30 1230  3    tree an Indian underclassman, disdaining both the platform
F30 1230 11    and the English language, harangued the assemblage
F30 1240  7    in his aboriginal tongue. Governor Wentworth contributed
F30 1250  4    an ox for a barbecue on the green beneath the three-hundred-foot
F30 1260  6    pines, and a barrel of rum was broached. The cook got
F30 1270  4    drunk, and President Wheelock proved to be a man of
F30 1280  2    broad talents by carving the ox himself.
F30 1280  9       Future commencements were more decorous perhaps,
F30 1290  5    but the number of graduates increased from the original
F30 1300  4    four at a relatively slow pace. By the end of the nineteenth
F30 1310  1    century, in 1893, when the Big Three, Columbia, and
F30 1310 10    Penn were populous centers of learning, Dartmouth graduated
F30 1320  8    only sixty-nine. The dormitories, including the beloved
F30 1330  6    Dartmouth Hall, could barely house two hundred students
F30 1340  5    in Spartan fashion.
F30 1340  8       Then in 1893 Dr& William Jewett Tucker became president
F30 1350  7    and the college's great awakening began. He transformed
F30 1360  6    Dartmouth from a small New Hampshire institution into
F30 1370  4    a national college. By 1907 the number of undergraduates
F30 1380  2    had risen to 1,107. And at his last commencement, in
F30 1390  1    that year, Dr& Tucker and Dartmouth were honored by
F30 1390 10    the presence of distinguished academic visitors attesting
F30 1400  6    to the new stature of the college. The presidents of
F30 1410  5    Cornell, Wisconsin, C&C&N&Y&, Bowdoin, Vermont, Brown,
F30 1420  4    Columbia, Princeton, Yale, and Harvard and the presidents
F30 1430  4    emeritus of Harvard and Michigan were there.
F30 1440  1       Dartmouth is numerically still a small college today,
F30 1440  9    with approximately twenty-nine hundred undergraduates.
F30 1450  5    But it has achieved a cross-section of students from
F30 1460  6    almost all the states, and two-thirds of its undergraduates
F30 1470  3    come from outside New England. Over 450 different schools
F30 1480  2    are usually represented in each entering class. Only
F30 1480 10    a dozen or so schools send as many as six students,
F30 1490 10    and there are seldom more than fifteen men in any single
F30 1500  7    delegation. About two-thirds of the boys now come from
F30 1510  5    public schools.
F30 1510  7       It is still a college only and not a university;
F30 1520  5    it is, in fact, the only college in the Ivy group.
F30 1530  2    However, three distinguished associated graduate schools
F30 1530  8    offer professional curriculums- the Dartmouth Medical
F30 1540  6    School (third oldest in the country and founded in
F30 1550  7    1797), the Thayer School of Engineering, and the Amos
F30 1560  4    Tuck School of Business Administration. All three are
F30 1570  3    purposely kept small, with a current total enrollment
F30 1570 11    of about two hundred.
F30 1580  4       All three schools coordinate their educational programs
F30 1590  2    with that of the undergraduate college and, like the
F30 1590 11    college proper, place emphasis upon a broad liberal
F30 1600  7    arts course as the proper foundation for specialized
F30 1610  3    study. Students of the college who are candidates for
F30 1620  2    the A&B& degree and can satisfy the academic requirements
F30 1630  1    of the medical and business schools, may enter either
F30 1630 10    of these associated schools at the beginning of senior
F30 1640  7    year, thus completing the two-year postgraduate course
F30 1650  5    in one year. The Thayer School offers a year of postgraduate
F30 1660  5    study in somewhat the same way, after a boy wins a
F30 1670  2    B&S& in engineering.
F30 1670  5       So Dartmouth is moving closer to the others in the
F30 1680  6    Ivy group. It is still, however, the junior member
F30 1690  1    of the League, if not in years at least in the catching
F30 1690 13    up it has had to do. It has not been a well-known school
F30 1700 12    for any part of the span the other Ivies have enjoyed.
F30 1710  6    However much football has been over-emphasized, the
F30 1720  2    public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by
F30 1730  1    the scoreboard, so, while Yale need never give its
F30 1730 10    record a thought again since outscoring its opponents
F30 1740  5    694 to 0 in the season of 1888, Dartmouth had to wait
F30 1750  4    until its championship team of 1925 for national recognition.
F30 1760  2       It has come on with a rush in more significant areas.
F30 1770  1    Today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that
F30 1770 10    other institutions might consider somewhat breathtaking.
F30 1780  5    But Dartmouth preserves its youthful brashness even
F30 1790  5    in its educational attitudes, and, although some of
F30 1800  3    its experiments may still be in the testing stage,
F30 1800 12    they make for lively copy.
F30 1810  5       President Emeritus Hopkins once proposed to corral
F30 1820  3    an "aristocracy of brains" in Hanover.
F31 0010  1    The person who left the buggy there has never been
F31 0010 11    identified. It was a busy street, conveniently near
F31 0020  6    the shopping center, and unattended horses and wagons
F31 0030  4    were often left at the curbside.
F31 0030 10       There are, of course, many weaknesses in any case
F31 0040  8    against Emma. She didn't like her stepmother, but nothing
F31 0050  5    is known to have occurred shortly before the crime
F31 0060  3    that could have caused such a murderous rage. She had
F31 0060 13    no way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity
F31 0070  9    for murder existed. She would have been taking more
F31 0080  7    than a fair risk of being seen and recognized during
F31 0090  2    her travels. If she avoided the train and hired a buggy,
F31 0100  1    the stableman might have recognized her. If police
F31 0100  9    had checked on her more thoroughly than is indicated,
F31 0110  7    she would be completely eliminated as a suspect.
F31 0120  4    ##
F31 0120  5    Uncle John Vinnicum Morse was the immediate popular
F31 0130  2    suspect. His sudden unannounced appearance at the Borden
F31 0140  1    home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of
F31 0140 13    baggage with him, although he clearly intended to stay
F31 0150  7    overnight, if not longer.
F31 0160  1       Lizzie stated during the inquest that while her
F31 0160  9    father and uncle were in the sitting room the afternoon
F31 0170  7    before the murders, she had been disturbed by their
F31 0180  4    voices and had closed her door, even though it was
F31 0190  1    a very hot day.
F31 0190  5       It is evident that Lizzie did not tell everything
F31 0200  1    she overheard between her father and her Uncle Morse.
F31 0200 10    At that time Jennings had a young law associate named
F31 0210  9    Arthur S& Phillips. A few years ago, not too long before
F31 0220  9    his death, Phillips revealed in a newspaper story that
F31 0230  6    he had always suspected Morse of the murders. He said
F31 0240  3    Morse and Borden had quarreled violently in the house
F31 0240 12    that day, information which must have come from Lizzie.
F31 0250  9    It was obviously the sound of this argument that caused
F31 0260  8    Lizzie to close her door.
F31 0270  1       The New Bedford Standard-Times has reported Knowlton
F31 0280  1    as saying, long after the trial, that if he only knew
F31 0280 12    what Borden said during his conversation with Morse,
F31 0290  6    he would have convicted "somebody". Notice, Knowlton
F31 0300  3    did not say that he would have obtained a conviction
F31 0310  2    in the trial of Lizzie Borden. He said he would have
F31 0310 13    convicted "somebody".
F31 0320  2       It is known that Morse did associate with a group
F31 0330  3    of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters
F31 0330 11    at Westport, a town not far from Fall River. They were
F31 0340 11    a vagabond lot and considered to be shady and undesirable
F31 0350  8    characters. Fall River police did go to Westport to
F31 0360  6    see if they could get any information against Morse
F31 0370  2    and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have
F31 0370 11    hired from among these men. These officers found no
F31 0380  8    incriminating information.
F31 0390  1       Morse's alibi was not as solid as it seemed. He
F31 0390 11    said he returned from the visit to his niece on the
F31 0400 10    11:20 streetcar. The woman in the house where the niece
F31 0410  7    was staying backed up his story and said she left when
F31 0420  4    he did to shop for her dinner. Fall River is not a
F31 0430  1    fashionable town. The dinner hour there was twelve
F31 0430  9    noon. If this woman had delayed until after 11:20 to
F31 0440  7    start her shopping, she would have had little time
F31 0450  4    in which to prepare the substantial meal that was eaten
F31 0460  2    at dinner in those days. It is possible that Morse
F31 0460 12    told the woman it was 11:20, but it could have been
F31 0470  9    earlier, since she did serve dinner on time. Police
F31 0480  5    did make an attempt to check on Morse's alibi. They
F31 0490  2    interviewed the conductor of the streetcar Morse said
F31 0490 10    he had taken, but the man did not remember Morse as
F31 0500 11    a passenger. Questioned further, Morse said that there
F31 0510  6    had been four or five priests riding on the same car
F31 0520  5    with him. The conductor did recall having priests as
F31 0530  2    passengers and this satisfied police, although the
F31 0530  9    conductor also pointed out that in heavily Catholic
F31 0540  7    Fall River there were priests riding on almost every
F31 0550  5    trip the streetcar made, so Morse's statement really
F31 0560  2    proved nothing.
F31 0560  4       We do know that Morse left the house before nine
F31 0570  3    o'clock. Bridget testified she saw him leave through
F31 0570 11    the side door. Morse said Borden let him out and locked
F31 0580 11    the screen door. From that point on he said he went
F31 0590  9    to the post office and then walked leisurely to where
F31 0600  4    his niece was staying, more than a mile away. He met
F31 0610  3    nobody he knew on this walk. There is no accounting
F31 0610 13    of his movements in this long gap of time which covers
F31 0620  9    the early hours when Mrs& Borden was killed.
F31 0630  4       Morse testified that while he was having breakfast
F31 0640  2    in the dining room, Mrs& Borden told the servant, "Bridget,
F31 0650  1    I want you to wash these windows today". Bridget's
F31 0650 10    testimony was in direct contradiction. She said it
F31 0660  8    was after she returned from her vomiting spell in the
F31 0670  7    back yard that Mrs& Borden told her to wash the windows.
F31 0680  6    This was long after Morse had left the house.
F31 0690  1       Morse's knowledge of what Mrs& Borden told Bridget
F31 0690  9    could indicate that he had returned secretly to the
F31 0700  9    house and was hidden there. He knew the house fairly
F31 0710  7    well, he had been there on two previous visits during
F31 0720  3    the past three or four months alone. And despite Knowlton's
F31 0730  1    attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter
F31 0730 11    than a drum, this was not true. The screen door was
F31 0740 11    unlocked for some ten or fifteen minutes while Bridget
F31 0750  6    was sick in the back. It was unlocked all the time
F31 0760  4    she was washing windows. Morse could have returned
F31 0770  1    openly while Bridget was sick in the back yard and
F31 0770 11    gone up to the room he had occupied. Mrs& Borden would
F31 0780  7    not have been alarmed if she saw Morse with an ax or
F31 0790  7    hatchet in his hand. He had been to the farm the previous
F31 0800  3    day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet
F31 0810  1    at the farm. Mrs& Borden would have had no reason to
F31 0810 12    disbelieve him and he could have approached close enough
F31 0820  8    to her to swing before she could cry out. He could
F31 0830  6    have left for Weybosset Street after her murder and
F31 0840  3    made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar.
F31 0840 13       If he took an earlier streetcar than the 11:20 on
F31 0850 10    his return, he could have arrived at the Borden house
F31 0860  7    shortly after Mr& Borden came home. With Lizzie in
F31 0870  5    the barn, the screen door unlocked and Bridget upstairs
F31 0880  2    in her attic room, he would have had free and easy
F31 0880 13    access to the house. With the second murder over, he
F31 0890  9    could have left, hidden the weapon in some vacant lot
F31 0900  6    or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood. His unconcerned
F31 0910  3    stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree, with
F31 0920  2    crowds already gathering in front of the building and
F31 0920 11    Sawyer guarding the side door, was odd. There was no
F31 0930  9    close examination of his clothes for bloodstains, and
F31 0940  5    certainly no scientific test was made of them. And
F31 0950  3    for a man who traveled around without any change of
F31 0950 13    clothing, a few more stains on his dark suit may very
F31 0960 11    well have gone unnoticed.
F31 0970  1       The motive may have been the mysterious quarrel;
F31 0970  9    there was no financial gain for Morse in the murders.
F31 0980  9       On the other side of the ledger is the fact that
F31 0990  8    he did see his niece and the woman with whom she was
F31 1000  4    staying. The time would have been shortly after the
F31 1010  1    murder of Mrs& Borden and they noticed nothing unusual
F31 1010 10    in his behavior. He said he had promised Mrs& Borden
F31 1020  8    to return in time for dinner and that was close to
F31 1030  6    the time when he did turn up at the Borden house.
F31 1040  2    ##
F31 1040  3    What did Pearson say about Bridget Sullivan as a possible
F31 1050  1    suspect in his trial-book essay? He wrote:
F31 1050  9       "The police soon ceased to look upon either Bridget
F31 1060  9    or Mr& Morse as in possession of guilty knowledge.
F31 1070  5    Neither had any interest in the deaths; indeed, it
F31 1080  3    was probably to Mr& Morse's advantage to have Mr& and
F31 1090  3    Mrs& Borden alive. Both he and Bridget were exonerated
F31 1100  1    by Lizzie herself". That was his complete discussion
F31 1100  9    of Bridget Sullivan as a possible suspect.
F31 1110  6       Although Pearson disbelieved almost everything Lizzie
F31 1120  4    said, and read a sinister purpose into almost everything
F31 1130  2    she did, he happily accepted her statement about Bridget
F31 1140  1    as the whole truth. He felt nothing further need be
F31 1140 11    said about the servant girl.
F31 1150  3       The exoneration Pearson speaks of is not an exoneration,
F31 1160  1    but Lizzie's expression of her opinion, as reported
F31 1160  9    in the testimony of Assistant Marshal Fleet. This officer
F31 1170  8    had asked Lizzie if she suspected her Uncle Morse,
F31 1180  7    and she replied she didn't think he did it because
F31 1190  6    he left the house before the murders and returned after
F31 1200  2    them. Fleet asked the same question about Bridget,
F31 1200 10    and Lizzie pointed out that as far as she knew Bridget
F31 1210 10    had gone up to her room before her father's murder
F31 1230  5    and came down when she called her.
F31 1240  1       Lizzie, actually, never named any suspect. She told
F31 1240  9    police about the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling
F31 1250  8    with her father some weeks before the murders, but
F31 1260  6    she said she thought he was from out of town because
F31 1270  3    she heard him mention something about talking to his
F31 1270 12    partner. And, much as she detested Hiram Harrington,
F31 1280  8    she also did not accuse him. At the inquest she was
F31 1290  8    asked specifically whether she knew anybody her father
F31 1300  4    had bad feelings toward, or who had bad feelings toward
F31 1310  1    her father. She replied, "I know of one man that has
F31 1310 12    not been friendly with him. They have not been friendly
F31 1320  9    for years". Asked who this was, she named Harrington.
F31 1330  7    Her statement certainly was true; the press reported
F31 1340  4    the same facts in using Harrington's interview, but
F31 1350  2    Lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that Harrington
F31 1350 11    was the killer.
F31 1360  2       When I interviewed Kirby, who as a boy picked up
F31 1360 12    pears in the Borden yard, I asked if anybody else in
F31 1370 11    the household besides Lizzie and Morse had been under
F31 1380  7    any suspicion at the time of the murders. He said he
F31 1390  5    had not heard of anybody else. "How about Bridget Sullivan"?
F31 1400  2    I inquired. "Oh, she was just the maid there", he replied,
F31 1410  3    waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant
F31 1420  1    she was. Kirby was, of course, reflecting the opinion
F31 1420 10    that existed at the time of the murders.
F31 1430  7       Everyone somehow manages to overlook completely
F31 1440  2    the fact that, as far as we know, there were exactly
F31 1440 13    two people in and about the house at the time of both
F31 1450 12    murders: Lizzie Borden and Bridget Sullivan.
F31 1460  5       All the officials on the case seem to have been
F31 1470  5    afflicted with a similar myopia as far as Bridget was
F31 1480  1    concerned, although records in police files contain
F31 1480  8    many reports of servants who have murdered their employers.
F31 1490  7    True, it is no longer cricket for the butler to be
F31 1500  6    the killer in mystery fiction, but we are dealing here
F31 1510  2    with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters
F31 1520  1    and situations.
F31 1520  3       The actions of Bridget should be examined, since
F31 1530  2    she was there and opportunity did exist, if only to
F31 1530 12    establish her innocence. There are also other factors
F31 1540  7    that require closer examination.
F31 1550  1       The legend as it exists in Fall River today always
F31 1550 11    includes the solemn assurance that Bridget returned
F31 1560  7    to Ireland after the trial with a "big bundle" of cash
F31 1570  8    which Lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut. The
F31 1580  5    people who believe and retell the legend have apparently
F31 1590  2    never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not
F31 1590 12    know that the maid changed her testimony on several
F31 1600  9    key points, always to the detriment of Lizzie. If Bridget
F31 1610  7    did get any bundles of cash, the last person who would
F31 1620  6    have rewarded her for services rendered would have
F31 1630  2    been Lizzie Borden.
F31 1630  5       Bridget was born in Ireland, one of fourteen children.
F31 1640  4    She was apparently the pioneer in her family because
F31 1650  1    she had no close relatives in this country at that
F31 1650 11    time. She worked as a domestic, first in Newport for
F31 1660  8    a year, and then in South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
F31 1670  3    for another year. She finally settled in Fall River
F31 1680  2    and, after being employed for a time by a Mrs& Reed,
F31 1680 13    was hired by the Bordens.
F31 1690  5       I have previously described how, during the week
F31 1700  3    of the murder, Bridget spent the first few hot days
F31 1700 13    scrubbing and ironing clothes.
F32 0010  1    Her father, James Upton, was the Upton mentioned by
F32 0010 10    Hawthorne in the famous introduction to the Scarlet
F32 0020  7    Letter as one of those who came into the old custom
F32 0030  6    house to do business with him as the surveyor of the
F32 0040  3    port. A gentleman of the old school, Mr& Upton possessed
F32 0050  1    intellectual power, ample means, and withal, was a
F32 0050  9    devoted Christian. The daughter profited from his interest
F32 0060  7    in scientific and philosophical subjects. Her mother
F32 0070  4    also was a person of superior mind and broad interests.
F32 0080  2       There is clear evidence that Lucy from childhood
F32 0090  1    had an unusual mind. She possessed an observant eye,
F32 0090 10    a retentive memory, and a critical faculty. When she
F32 0100  7    was nine years old, she wrote a description of a store
F32 0110  6    she had visited. She named 48 items, and said there
F32 0120  2    were "many more things which it would take too long
F32 0120 12    to write". An essay on "Freedom" written at 10 years
F32 0130  9    of age quoted the Declaration of Independence, the
F32 0140  5    freedom given to slaves in Canada, and the views of
F32 0150  5    George Washington.
F32 0150  7       Lucy Upton was graduated from the Salem High School
F32 0160  6    when few colleges, only Oberlin and Elmira, were open
F32 0170  4    to women; and she had an appetite for learning that
F32 0180  2    could not be denied.
F32 0180  6       A picture of her in high school comes from a younger
F32 0190  4    schoolmate, Albert S& Flint, friend of her brother
F32 0200  1    Winslow, and later, like Winslow, a noted astronomer.
F32 0200  9    He recalled Lucy, as "a bright-looking black-eyed young
F32 0210  9    lady who came regularly through the boys' study hall
F32 0220  6    to join the class in Greek in the little recitation
F32 0230  2    room beyond". The study of Greek was the distinctive
F32 0240  1    mark of boys destined to go to college, and Lucy Upton
F32 0240 12    too expected to go to college and take the full classical
F32 0250 10    course offered to men. The death of her mother in 1865
F32 0260  8    prevented this. With four younger children at home,
F32 0270  4    Lucy stepped into her mother's role, and even after
F32 0280  1    the brothers and sisters were grown, she was her father's
F32 0280 11    comfort and stay until he died in 1879. But even so
F32 0290 11    Lucy could not give up her intellectual pursuits. When
F32 0300  5    her brother Winslow became a student at Brown University
F32 0310  4    in 1874, she wrote him about a course in history he
F32 0320  2    was taking under Professor Diman: "What is Prof& Diman's
F32 0330  1    definition of civilization, and take the world through,
F32 0330  9    is its progress ever onward, or does it retrograde
F32 0340  7    at times? Do you think I might profitably study some
F32 0350  5    of the history you do, perhaps two weeks behind you
F32 0360  3    **h". And that she proceeded to do.
F32 0360 10       Many years later (on August 3, 1915), Lucy Upton
F32 0370  7    wrote Winslow's daughter soon to be graduated from
F32 0380  5    Smith College: "While I love botany which, after dabbling
F32 0390  3    in for years, I studied according to the methods of
F32 0400  2    that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school,
F32 0400 12    it must be fascinating to take up zoology in the way
F32 0410  8    you are doing. Whatever was the science in the high
F32 0420  5    school course for the time being, that was my favorite
F32 0430  1    study. Mathematics came next".
F32 0430  5       Her study of history was persistently pursued. She
F32 0440  5    read Maitland's Dark Ages, "which I enjoyed very much";
F32 0450  5    La Croix on the Customs of the Middle Ages; 16 chapters
F32 0460  4    of Bryce "and liked it more and more"; more chapters
F32 0470  3    of Guizot; Lecky and Stanley's Eastern Church. She
F32 0480  2    discussed in her letters to Winslow some of the questions
F32 0490  1    that came to her as she studied alone.
F32 0490  9       Lucy's correspondence with brother Winslow during
F32 0500  5    his college days was not entirely taken up with academic
F32 0510  4    studies. She played chess with him by postcard. Also
F32 0520  2    Lucy and Winslow had a private contest to see which
F32 0520 12    one could make the most words from the letters in
F32 0530  9    "importunately".
F32 0530 10    Who won is not revealed, but Winslow's daughter Eleanor
F32 0540  8    says they got up to 1,212 words.
F32 0550  3       There was another family interest also. Winslow
F32 0560  1    had musical talents, as had his father before him.
F32 0560 10    At different times he served as glee-club and choir
F32 0570  8    leader and as organist. And it was Lucy Upton who first
F32 0580  5    started the idea of a regular course in Music at Spelman
F32 0590  3    College.
F32 0590  4       Winslow Upton after graduation from Brown University
F32 0600  2    and two years of graduate study, accepted a position
F32 0610  1    at the Harvard Observatory. For three years he was
F32 0610 10    connected with the U&S& Naval Observatory and with
F32 0620  7    the U&S& Signal Corps; and after 1883, was professor
F32 0630  6    of astronomy at Brown University. The six expeditions
F32 0640  4    to study eclipses of the sun, of which he was a member,
F32 0650  3    took him to Colorado, Virginia, and California as well
F32 0650 12    as to the South Pacific and to Russia. After her father's
F32 0660 11    death, Lucy and her youngest sister lived for a few
F32 0670  9    years with Winslow in Washington, D&C&. "Their house",
F32 0680  4    writes Albert S& Flint, "was always a haven of hospitality
F32 0690  7    and good cheer, especially grateful to one like myself
F32 0700  5    far from home". Lucy was a lively part of the household.
F32 0710  2    Moreover, she had physical as well as mental vigor.
F32 0710 11    Winslow, as his daughters Eleanor and Margaret recall,
F32 0720  8    used to characterize her as "our iron sister". There
F32 0730  7    is reason to suppose that Lucy would have made a record
F32 0740  6    as publicly distinguished as her brother had it not
F32 0750  4    been that her mother's death occurred just as she was
F32 0750 14    about to enter college. As a matter of fact, Albert
F32 0760 10    S& Flint expressed his conviction that "her physical
F32 0770  6    strength, her mental power, her lively interest in
F32 0780  4    all objects about her and her readiness to serve her
F32 0790  2    fellow beings" would have led her "to a distinguished
F32 0790 11    career amongst the noted women of this country".
F32 0800  8       While in Washington, D&C&, Lucy Upton held positions
F32 0810  6    in the U&S& Census Office, and in the Pension Bureau.
F32 0820  7    They were not sufficiently challenging however, and
F32 0830  3    she resigned in 1887, to go to Germany with her brother
F32 0840  2    Winslow and his family while he was there on study.
F32 0840 12    After the months in Europe, she returned to Boston
F32 0850  8    and became active in church and community life.
F32 0860  4       What was called an "accidental meeting" with Miss
F32 0870  3    Packard in Washington turned her attention to Spelman.
F32 0880  1    Here was a cause she believed in. After correspondence
F32 0880 10    with Miss Packard and to the joy of Miss Packard and
F32 0890 10    Miss Giles, she came to Atlanta, in the fall of 1888,
F32 0900  8    to help wherever needed, although there was then no
F32 0910  5    money available to pay her a salary. She served for
F32 0920  1    a number of years without pay beyond her travel and
F32 0920 11    maintenance.
F32 0930  1       Her students have spoken of the exacting standards
F32 0930  9    of scholarship and of manners and conduct she expected
F32 0940  8    and achieved from the students; of her "great power
F32 0950  5    of discernment"; of "her exquisiteness of dress", "her
F32 0960  4    well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts
F32 0970  1    of the hearers"; her great love of flowers and plants
F32 0970 11    and birds; and her close knowledge of individual students.
F32 0980  8       She drew on all her resources of mind and heart
F32 0990  9    to help them- to make them at home in the world; and
F32 1000  7    as graduates gratefully recall, she drew on her purse
F32 1010  3    as well. Many a student was able to remain at Spelman,
F32 1010 14    only because of her unobtrusive help.
F32 1020  6       Under Miss Upton, the work of the year 1909-10 went
F32 1030  7    forward without interruption. After all, she had come
F32 1040  4    to Spelman Seminary in 1888, and had been since 1891
F32 1040 14    except for one year, Associate Principal or Dean. She
F32 1050  9    had taught classes in botany, astronomy (with the aid
F32 1060  7    of a telescope), geometry, and psychology.
F32 1080  2       Miss Upton and Miss Packard, as a matter of fact,
F32 1090  1    had many tastes in common. Both had eager and inquiring
F32 1090 11    minds; and both believed that intellectual growth must
F32 1100  7    go hand in hand with the development of sturdy character
F32 1110  5    and Christian zeal. Both loved the out-of-doors, including
F32 1120  5    mountain climbing and horseback riding. In 1890 when
F32 1130  2    the trip to Europe and the Holy Land was arranged for
F32 1130 13    Miss Packard, it was Miss Upton who planned the trip,
F32 1140 10    and "with rare executive ability" bore the brunt of
F32 1150  7    "the entire pilgrimage from beginning to end". So strenuous
F32 1160  6    it was physically, with its days of horseback riding
F32 1170  3    over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance
F32 1180  1    for both Miss Packard and Miss Upton. Yet they thrived
F32 1180 11    on it.
F32 1190  2       At the Fifteenth Anniversary (1896) as already quoted,
F32 1200  6    Miss Upton projected with force and eloquence the Spelman
F32 1210  9    of the Future as a college of first rank, with expanding
F32 1220  9    and unlimited horizons. When Dr& Wallace Buttrick,
F32 1230  5    wise in his judgment of people, declined to have the
F32 1240  4    Science Building named for him, he wrote Miss Tapley
F32 1250  1    (April 7, 1923) "**h If you had asked me, I think I
F32 1250 13    would have suggested that you name the building for
F32 1260  8    Miss Upton. Her services to the School for many years
F32 1270  7    were of a very high character, and I have often thought
F32 1280  4    that one of the buildings should be named for her".
F32 1290  1       Such were the qualities of the Acting-President
F32 1290  9    of the Seminary after the death of Miss Giles.
F32 1310  7       At the meeting of the Board of Trustees, on March
F32 1320  6    3, 1910, Miss Upton presented the annual report of
F32 1330  3    the President. She noted that no student had been withdrawn
F32 1340  1    through loss of confidence; that the enrollment showed
F32 1340  9    an increase of boarding students as was desired; and
F32 1350  8    that the year's work had gone forward smoothly. She
F32 1360  6    urged the importance of more thorough preparation for
F32 1370  3    admission. The raising of the $25,000 Improvement Fund
F32 1380  2    two days before the time limit expired, and the spontaneous
F32 1380 12    "praise demonstration" held afterward on the campus,
F32 1390  7    were reported as events which had brought happiness
F32 1400  6    to Miss Giles. With the Fund in hand, the debt on the
F32 1410  6    boilers had been paid; Rockefeller and Packard Halls
F32 1420  2    had been renovated; walks laid; and ground had been
F32 1420 11    broken for the superintendent's home. Miss Upton spoke
F32 1430  8    gratefully of the response of Spelman graduates and
F32 1440  7    Negro friends in helping to raise the Fund, and their
F32 1450  5    continuing efforts to raise money for greatly needed
F32 1460  2    current expenses. She spoke also with deep thankfulness
F32 1460 10    of the many individuals and agencies whose interest
F32 1470  7    and efforts through the years had made the work so
F32 1480  7    fruitful in results.
F32 1480 10       Two bequests were recorded: one of $200 under the
F32 1490  8    will of Mrs& Harriet A& Copp of Los Angeles; and one
F32 1500  7    of $2,000 under the will of Miss Celia L& Brett of
F32 1510  4    Hamilton, New York, a friend from the early days.
F32 1520  1       Miss Upton told the Trustees that the death of Miss
F32 1520 11    Giles was "the sorest grief" the Seminary had ever
F32 1530  9    been called upon to bear. The daughters of Spelman,
F32 1550  7    she said, had never known or thought of Spelman without
F32 1560  4    her. The removal of Miss Packard 18 years earlier had
F32 1570  2    caused them great sorrow, but they still had Miss Giles.
F32 1580  1    Now the school was indeed bereft. "Yet Spelman has
F32 1580 10    strong, deep roots, and will live for the blessing
F32 1590  7    of generations to come".
F32 1590 11    #@#
F32 1600  1    Miss Mary Jane Packard, Sophia's half-sister, became
F32 1600  9    ill in March, 1910; and when school closed, she was
F32 1610  9    unable to travel to Massachusetts. She remained in
F32 1620  4    Atlanta through June and July; she died on August sixth.
F32 1630  5       Before coming on a visit to Spelman in 1885, Miss
F32 1640  4    Mary had been a successful teacher in Worcester, and
F32 1650  1    her position there was held open for her for a considerable
F32 1650 12    period. But she decided to stay at Spelman. She helped
F32 1660  9    with teaching as well as office work for a few years-
F32 1670  8    the catalogues show that she had classes in geography,
F32 1680  3    rhetoric and bookkeeping. Soon the office work claimed
F32 1690  1    all her time. She was closely associated with the Founders
F32 1690 11    in all their trials and hardships. Quiet and energetic,
F32 1700  8    cheerful and calm, she too was a power in the development
F32 1710  9    of the seminary. Miss Giles always used to refer to
F32 1720  6    her as "Sister". She served as secretary in the Seminary
F32 1730  4    office for 25 years, and was in charge of correspondence,
F32 1740  1    records, and bookkeeping. The books of the school hold
F32 1740 10    a memorial to her; and so do the hearts of students
F32 1750 10    and of teachers.
F32 1760  1       Mary J& Packard, states a Messenger editorial, was
F32 1760  9    "efficient, pains-taking, self-effacing, loving, radiating
F32 1770  7    the spirit of her Master. With infinite patience she
F32 1780  6    responded to every call, no matter at what cost to
F32 1790  5    herself, and to her all went, for she was sure to have
F32 1800  2    the needed information or word of cheer.
F33 0010  1       In a few school districts one finds a link between
F33 0010 11    school and job. In those vocational programs organized
F33 0020  7    with Smith-Hughes money, there may be a close tie between
F33 0030  8    the labor union and a local employer on the one hand
F33 0040  5    and the vocational teacher on the other. In these cases
F33 0050  1    a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program,
F33 0050 10    saving a year because of his vocational courses in
F33 0060  9    grades 11 and 12. The apprentice program will involve
F33 0070  4    further education on a part-time basis, usually at
F33 0080  2    night, perhaps using some of the same equipment of
F33 0080 11    the high school. These opportunities are to be found
F33 0090  8    in certain cities in such crafts as auto mechanics,
F33 0100  5    carpentry, drafting, electrical work, tool-and-die
F33 0110  1    work, and sheet-metal work.
F33 0110  6       Formally organized vocational programs supported
F33 0120  3    by federal funds allow high school students to gain
F33 0130  2    experience in a field of work which is likely to lead
F33 0130 13    to a full-time job on graduation. The "diversified
F33 0140  6    occupations" program is a part-time trade-preparatory
F33 0150  5    program conducted over two school years on a cooperative
F33 0160  3    basis between the school and local industrial and business
F33 0170  1    employers. The "distributive education" program operates
F33 0170  7    in a similar way, with arrangements between the school
F33 0180  9    and employers in merchandising fields. In both cases
F33 0190  5    the student attends school half-time and works in a
F33 0200  5    regular job the other half. He receives remuneration
F33 0210  1    for his work. In a few places cooperative programs
F33 0210 10    between schools and employers in clerical work have
F33 0220  7    shown the same possibilities for allowing the student,
F33 0230  3    while still in school, to develop skills which are
F33 0240  1    immediately marketable upon graduation.
F33 0240  5       Adult education courses, work-study programs of
F33 0250  5    various sorts- these are all evidence of a continuing
F33 0260  3    interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities
F33 0270  1    for out-of-school youth. In general, however, it may
F33 0270 11    be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school,
F33 0280 12    the school authorities play little or no part in the
F33 0290  8    decision of what happens next. If the student drops
F33 0300  3    out of high school, the break with the school is even
F33 0310  1    more complete. When there is employment opportunity
F33 0310  8    for youth, this arrangement- or lack of arrangement-
F33 0320  5    works out quite well. Indeed, in some periods of our
F33 0330  6    history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities
F33 0340  1    have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys
F33 0340 11    who were potential members of the professions quit
F33 0350  7    school at an early age and went to work. Statistically
F33 0360  5    this has represented a loss to the nation, although
F33 0370  2    one must admit that in an individual case the decision
F33 0370 12    in retrospect may have been a wise one. I make no attempt
F33 0380 12    to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being
F33 0390  7    of a man who went to work on graduation from high school
F33 0400  6    and was highly successful in the business which he
F33 0410  3    entered. He may or may not be "better off" than his
F33 0420  1    classmate who went on to a college and professional
F33 0420 10    school. But in the next decades the nation needs to
F33 0430  8    educate for the professions all the potential professional
F33 0440  4    talent.
F33 0440  5       In a later chapter dealing with the suburban school,
F33 0450  5    I shall discuss the importance of arranging a program
F33 0460  3    for the academically talented and highly gifted youth
F33 0460 11    in any high school where he is found. In the Negro
F33 0470 10    neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed
F33 0480  7    neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification
F33 0490  2    and motivation. High motivation towards higher education
F33 0500  1    must start early enough so that by the time the boy
F33 0500 12    or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at least developed
F33 0510 10    those basic skills which are essential for academic
F33 0520  4    work. Undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower
F33 0530  2    grades in this regard in the Negro schools. However,
F33 0530 11    the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the
F33 0540 11    community and the family is anti-intellectual. And
F33 0550  5    the fact remains that there are today few shining examples
F33 0560  3    of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership.
F33 0570  1    This is not due to any policy of discrimination on
F33 0570 11    the part of the Northern universities. Quite the contrary,
F33 0580  5    as I can testify from personal experience as a former
F33 0590  5    university president. Rather we see here another vicious
F33 0600  3    circle. The absence of successful Negroes in the world
F33 0610  1    of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down
F33 0610 10    enthusiasm among Negro youth for academic careers.
F33 0620  6    I believe the situation is improving, but the success
F33 0630  4    stories need to be heavily publicized. Here again we
F33 0640  2    run into the roadblock that Negroes do not like to
F33 0640 12    be designated as Negroes in the press. How can the
F33 0650  9    vicious circle be broken? This is a problem to which
F33 0660  6    leaders of opinion, both Negro and white, should devote
F33 0670  3    far more attention. It is at least as important as
F33 0670 13    the more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of
F33 0680  9    inequality in the South.
F33 0690  1    #VOCATIONAL EDUCATION#
F33 0690  3    I should like to underline four points I made in my
F33 0700  5    first report with respect to vocational education.
F33 0700 12    First and foremost, vocational courses should not replace
F33 0710  8    courses which are essential parts of the required academic
F33 0720  8    program for graduation. Second, vocational courses
F33 0730  3    should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require
F33 0740  3    more than half the student's time in those years; however,
F33 0750  1    for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses
F33 0750  9    ought to begin earlier. Third, the significance of
F33 0760  7    the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly
F33 0770  6    interested in the work; they realize the relevance
F33 0780  3    of what they are learning to their future careers,
F33 0780 12    and this sense of purpose is carried over to the academic
F33 0790 10    courses which they are studying at the same time. Fourth,
F33 0800  8    the type of vocational training programs should be
F33 0810  4    related to the employment opportunities in the general
F33 0820  2    locality. This last point is important because if high
F33 0820 11    school pupils are aware that few, if any, graduates
F33 0830  9    who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained
F33 0840  5    a job as a consequence of the training, the whole idea
F33 0850  4    of relevance disappears. Vocational training which
F33 0860  1    holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact
F33 0860 12    a marketable skill becomes just another school "chore"
F33 0870  7    for those whose interest in their studies has begun
F33 0880  6    to falter. Those who, because of population mobility
F33 0890  2    and the reputed desire of employers to train their
F33 0890 11    own employees, would limit vocational education to
F33 0900  6    general rather than specific skills ought to bear in
F33 0910  6    mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school
F33 0920  3    experience.
F33 0920  4       I have been using the word "vocational" as a layman
F33 0930  4    would at first sight think it should be used. I intend
F33 0940  1    to include under the term all the practical courses
F33 0940 10    open to boys and girls. These courses develop skills
F33 0950  7    other than those we think of when we use the adjective
F33 0960  6    "academic". Practically all of these practical skills
F33 0970  2    are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be
F33 0970 14    obtained in high school sufficient to enable the youth
F33 0980  9    to get a job at once on the basis of the skill. They
F33 0990  9    are in this sense skills marketable immediately on
F33 1000  3    graduation from high school. To be sure, in tool-and-die
F33 1010  1    work and in the building trades, the first job must
F33 1010 11    be often on an apprentice basis, but two years of half-time
F33 1020 11    vocational training enables the young man thus to anticipate
F33 1030  8    one year of apprentice status. Similarly, a girl who
F33 1040  5    graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography
F33 1050  1    and the use of clerical machines and who is able to
F33 1050 12    get a job at once may wish to improve her skill and
F33 1060 10    knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community
F33 1070  7    college or secretarial school. Of course, it can be
F33 1080  4    argued that an ability to write English correctly and
F33 1090  1    with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill.
F33 1090 10    So, too, is the mathematical competence of a college
F33 1100  5    graduate who has majored in mathematics. In a sense
F33 1110  4    almost all high school and college courses could be
F33 1120  1    considered as vocational to the extent that later in
F33 1120 10    life the student in his vocation (which may be a profession)
F33 1130  9    will be called upon to use some of the skills developed
F33 1140  6    and the competence obtained. In spite of the shading
F33 1150  4    of one type of course into another, I believe it is
F33 1150 15    useful to talk about vocational courses as apart from
F33 1160  9    academic courses. Perhaps a course in typewriting might
F33 1170  7    be regarded as the exception which proves the rule.
F33 1180  4    Today many college bound students try to take a course
F33 1190  2    in personal typing, as they feel a certain degree of
F33 1190 12    mastery of this skill is almost essential for one who
F33 1200  9    proposes to do academic work in college and a professional
F33 1210  6    school.
F33 1210  7       Most of our largest cities have one or more separate
F33 1220  7    vocational or technical high schools. In this respect,
F33 1230  4    public education in the large cities differs from education
F33 1240  1    in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts.
F33 1240  9    The neighborhood high schools are not, strictly speaking,
F33 1250  8    comprehensive schools, because some of the boys and
F33 1260  7    girls may be attending a vocational or technical high
F33 1270  4    school instead of the local school. Indeed, one school
F33 1280  2    superintendent in a large city objects to the use of
F33 1280 12    the term comprehensive high school for the senior high
F33 1290  7    schools in his city, because these schools do not offer
F33 1300  6    strictly vocational programs. He prefers to designate
F33 1310  3    such schools as "general" high schools. The suburban
F33 1320  1    high school, it is worth noting, also is not a widely
F33 1320 12    comprehensive high school because of the absence of
F33 1330  8    vocational programs. The reason is that there is a
F33 1350  6    lack of interest on the part of the community. Therefore
F33 1360  1    employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan
F33 1370  1    area are related in different ways from those which
F33 1370 10    are characteristic of the comprehensive high school
F33 1380  6    described in my first report.
F33 1390  1       The separate vocational or technical high schools
F33 1390  8    in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions.
F33 1400  7    By and large their programs are satisfactorily connected
F33 1410  4    both to the employment situation and to the realities
F33 1420  4    of the apprentice system. It is not often realized
F33 1430  1    to what degree certain trades are in many communities
F33 1430 10    closed areas of employment, except for a lucky few.
F33 1440  7    One has to talk confidentially with some of the directors
F33 1450  5    of vocational high schools to realize that a boy cannot
F33 1460  3    just say, "I want to be a plumber", and then, by doing
F33 1470  1    good work, find a job. It is far more difficult in
F33 1470 12    many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice
F33 1480  7    program which involves union approval than to get into
F33 1490  5    the most selective medical school in the nation. Two
F33 1500  2    stories will illustrate what I have in mind. One vocational
F33 1500 12    instructor in a city vocational school, speaking of
F33 1510  8    his course in a certain field, said he had no difficulty
F33 1520  7    placing all students in jobs outside of the city. In
F33 1530  5    the city, he said, the waiting list for those who want
F33 1540  3    to join the union is so long that unless a boy has
F33 1540 15    an inside track he can't get in. In a far distant part
F33 1550 11    of the United States, I was talking to an instructor
F33 1560  7    about a boy who in the twelfth grade was doing special
F33 1570  4    work. "What does he have in mind to do when he graduates"?
F33 1580  2    "Oh, he'll be a plumber", came the answer. "But isn't
F33 1590  2    it almost impossible to get into the union"? I asked.
F33 1600  1    "He'll have no difficulty", I was told. "He has very
F33 1600 11    good connections".
F33 1610  2       In my view, there should be a school which offers
F33 1620  1    significant vocational programs for boys within easy
F33 1620  8    reach of every family in a city. Ideally these schools
F33 1630  8    should be so located that one or more should be in
F33 1640  7    the area where demand for practical courses is at the
F33 1650  3    highest.
F33 1650  4       An excellent example of a successful location of
F33 1660  2    a new vocational high school is the Dunbar Vocational
F33 1660 11    High School in Chicago. Located in a bad slum area
F33 1670  9    now undergoing redevelopment, this school and its program
F33 1680  6    are especially tailored to the vocational aims of its
F33 1690  4    students. Hardly a window has been broken since Dunbar
F33 1710  1    first was opened (and vandalism in schools is a major
F33 1710 11    problem in many slum areas). I discovered in the course
F33 1720  8    of a visit there that almost all the pupils were Negroes.
F33 1730  6    They were learning trades as diverse as shoe repairing,
F33 1740  4    bricklaying, carpentry, cabinet making, auto mechanics,
F33 1750  1    and airplane mechanics. The physical facilities at
F33 1750  8    Dunbar are impressive, but more impressive is the attitude
F33 1760  8    of the pupils.
F34 0010  1       The soybean seed is the most important leguminous
F34 0010  9    food in the world. In the United States, where half
F34 0020  8    of the world crop is grown, soybeans are processed
F34 0030  4    for their edible oil. The residue from soybean processing
F34 0040  2    goes mainly into animal feeds.
F34 0040  7       Soybeans are extensively processed into a remarkable
F34 0050  5    number of food products in the Orient. American chemists,
F34 0060  3    seeking to increase exports of soybeans, have adapted
F34 0070  2    modern techniques and fermentation methods to improve
F34 0070  9    their use in such traditional Japanese foods as tofu
F34 0080  9    and miso and in tempeh of Indonesia. Soybean flour,
F34 0090  5    grits, flakes, "milk", and curd can be bought in the
F34 0100  5    United States.
F34 0100  7       Peanuts are the world's second most important legume.
F34 0110  5    They are used mainly for their oil. We produce peanut
F34 0120  3    oil, but to a much greater extent we eat the entire
F34 0120 14    seed. Blanched peanuts, as prepared for making peanut
F34 0130  8    butter or for eating as nuts, are roasted seeds whose
F34 0140  7    seedcoats have been rubbed off.
F34 0150  1       Cereal grains, supplemented with soybeans or dry
F34 0150  8    edible peas or beans, comprise about two-thirds or
F34 0160  6    three-fourths of the diet in parts of Asia and Africa.
F34 0170  4       In western Europe and North America, where the level
F34 0180  3    of economic development is higher, grains and other
F34 0180 11    seed products furnish less than one-third of the food
F34 0190 10    consumed. Rather, meat and potatoes, sugar, and dairy
F34 0200  7    products are the main sources of carbohydrate, protein,
F34 0210  2    oils, and fats. People depend less on seeds for foods
F34 0220  2    in Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina, where extensive
F34 0220 10    grazing lands support sheep or cattle, and the consumption
F34 0230  9    of meat is high.
F34 0240  1       Feeds for livestock took about one-sixth of the
F34 0240 10    world's cereal crop in 1957-1958. Most of the grain
F34 0250 10    is fed to swine and dairy cows and lesser amounts to
F34 0260  6    beef cattle and poultry. About 90 percent of the corn
F34 0270  4    used in the United States is fed to animals. The rest
F34 0280  1    is used for human food and industrial products. More
F34 0280 10    than half of the sorghum and barley seeds we produce
F34 0290  7    and most of the byproducts of the milling of cereals
F34 0300  4    and the crushing of oilseeds are fed to livestock.
F34 0310  1       More than 200 million tons of seeds and seed products
F34 0310 11    are fed to livestock annually in the United States.
F34 0320  8       The efficiency with which animals convert grains
F34 0330  6    and forages to meat has risen steadily in the United
F34 0340  4    States since the 1930's and has paralleled the increased
F34 0350  1    feeding of the cake and meal that are a byproduct when
F34 0350 12    seeds are processed for oil.
F34 0360  5    ##
F34 0360  6    THE DEMAND for food is so great in the world that little
F34 0370  5    arable land can be given over to growing the nonfood
F34 0380  1    crops. Seeds grown for industrial uses hold a relatively
F34 0380 10    minor position.
F34 0390  2       Chief among the seed crops grown primarily for industrial
F34 0400  1    uses are the oil-bearing seeds- flax, castor, tung
F34 0400 10    (nuts from the China wood-oil tree), perilla (from
F34 0410  8    an Oriental mint), and oiticica (from a Brazilian tree).
F34 0420  5       Oils, or liquid fats, from the seeds of flax and
F34 0430  5    tung have long been the principal constituents of paints
F34 0440  1    and varnishes for protecting and beautifying the surfaces
F34 0440  9    of wood and metal. These oils develop hard, smooth
F34 0450  8    films when they dry and form resinlike substances.
F34 0460  3       The artist who paints in oil uses drying oils to
F34 0470  3    carry the pigments and to protect his finished work
F34 0470 12    for the ages. One of the finest of artists' oils comes
F34 0480 10    from poppy seeds.
F34 0490  1       Seeds of soybean, cotton, corn, sesame, and rape
F34 0490  9    yield semidrying oils. Some are used in paints along
F34 0500  8    with drying oils. Palm oil protects the surfaces of
F34 0510  5    steel sheets before they are plated with tin.
F34 0520  1       Castor oil, made from castorbeans, has gone out
F34 0520  9    of style as a medicine. This nondrying oil, however,
F34 0530  6    is now more in demand than ever before as a fine lubricant,
F34 0540  6    as a constituent of fluids for hydraulically operated
F34 0550  2    equipment, and as a source of chemicals to make plastics.
F34 0560  1       Almond oil, another nondrying oil, was once used
F34 0560  9    extensively in perfumery to extract flower fragrances.
F34 0570  7    It is still used in drugs and cosmetics, but it is
F34 0580  6    rather scarce and sometimes is adulterated with oils
F34 0590  2    from peach and plum seeds.
F34 0590  7       Liquid fats from all these oilseeds enter into the
F34 0600  5    manufacture of soaps for industry and the household
F34 0610  1    and of glycerin for such industrial uses as making
F34 0610 10    explosives.
F34 0620  1       Sizable amounts of soybean, coconut, and palm kernel
F34 0620  9    oil- seed oils that are produced primarily for food
F34 0630  8    purposes- also are used to make soaps, detergents,
F34 0640  5    and paint resins.
F34 0640  8       Solid fats from the seeds of the mahua tree, the
F34 0650  8    shea tree, and the coconut palm are used to make candles
F34 0660  4    in tropical countries.
F34 0660  7       Seeds are a main source of starch for industrial
F34 0670  5    and food use in many parts of the world. Corn and wheat
F34 0680  4    supply most of the starch in the United States, Canada,
F34 0690  1    and Australia. In other countries where cereal grains
F34 0690  9    are not among the principal crops of a region, starchy
F34 0700  9    tubers or roots are processed for starch. Starch is
F34 0710  5    used in the paper, textile, and food-processing industries
F34 0720  2    and in a multitude of other manufacturing operations.
F34 0730  1       Gums were extracted from quince, psyllium (fleawort),
F34 0730  8    flax, and locust (carob) seeds in ancient times. Today
F34 0740  9    the yearly import into the United States of locust
F34 0750  7    bean gum is more than 15 million pounds; of psyllium
F34 0760  3    seed, more than 2.6 million. The discovery during the
F34 0770  2    Second World War that guar gum was similar to imported
F34 0770 12    locust gum increased its cultivation in western Asia
F34 0780  8    and initiated it in the United States.
F34 0790  3       Water-soluble gums are used in foods and drugs and
F34 0800  2    in the manufacture of pulp and paper as thickeners,
F34 0800 11    stabilizers, or dispersing agents. Guar gum thickens
F34 0810  7    salad dressings and stabilizes ice cream. Quince seed
F34 0820  5    gum is the main ingredient in wave-setting lotions.
F34 0830  2    Once regarded as an agricultural nuisance, psyllium
F34 0830  9    was sold in the 1930's as a mechanical laxative under
F34 0840  9    117 different brands. Locust gum is added to pulp slurries
F34 0850  8    to break up the lumps of fibers in making paper.

F34 0860  5    THE SEEDS of hard, fibrous, stony fruits, called nuts,
F34 0870  3    provide highly concentrated foods, oils, and other
F34 0870 10    materials of value. Most nuts consist of the richly
F34 0880  9    packaged storage kernel and its thick, adherent, brown
F34 0890  6    covering- the seedcoat.
F34 0890  9       The kernels of brazil nuts, cashews, coconuts, filberts,
F34 0900  8    hazelnuts, hickory nuts, pecans, walnuts, and pine
F34 0910  6    nuts are predominantly oily. Almonds and pistachio
F34 0920  3    nuts are not so high in oil but are rich in protein.
F34 0930  1    Chestnuts are starchy. All nut kernels are rich in
F34 0930 10    protein.
F34 0940  1       The world production of familiar seed nuts- almonds,
F34 0940  8    brazil nuts, filberts, and the English walnuts- totals
F34 0950  7    about 300 thousand tons annually.
F34 0960  1       Coconuts, the fruit of the coconut palm, have the
F34 0960 10    largest of all known seeds and are grown in South Pacific
F34 0970 11    islands as a crop for domestic and export markets.
F34 0980  7    The oil palm of West Africa yields edible oil from
F34 0990  4    both the flesh and the seed or kernel of its fruit.
F34 1000  1    World production of copra, the oil-bearing flesh of
F34 1000 10    the coconut, was a little more than 3 million tons
F34 1010  9    in 1959. Exports from producing countries in terms
F34 1020  4    of equivalent oil were a little more than 1 million
F34 1030  1    tons, about half of which was palm kernels or oil from
F34 1030 12    them and about half was palm oil.
F34 1040  5       Other nuts consumed in lesser quantity include the
F34 1050  2    spicy nutmeg; the soap nut, which owes its sudsing
F34 1050 11    power to natural saponins; the marking nut, used for
F34 1060  9    ink and varnish; the aromatic sassafras nut of South
F34 1070  6    America; and the sweet-smelling cumara nut, which is
F34 1080  5    suited for perfumes.
F34 1080  8       A forest crop that has not been extensively cultivated
F34 1090  5    is ivory nuts from the tagua palm. The so-called vegetable
F34 1100  5    ivory is the hard endosperm of the egg-sized seed.
F34 1110  2    It is used for making buttons and other small, hard
F34 1110 12    objects of turnery. Seeds of the sago palm are used
F34 1120  9    in Bermuda to make heads and faces of dolls sold to
F34 1130  6    tourists.
F34 1130  7    ##
F34 1130  8    THE COLOR AND SHAPE of seeds have long made them attractive
F34 1140  7    for ornaments and decorations.
F34 1150  1       Since Biblical times, rosaries have been made from
F34 1150  9    jobs-tears- the seeds of an Asiatic grass. Bead tree
F34 1160 11    seeds are the necklaces of South Pacific islanders
F34 1170  5    and the eyes of Buddha dolls in Cuba. Victorian ladies
F34 1180  3    had a fad of stringing unusual seeds to wear as jewelry.
F34 1190  1       Handmade Christmas wreaths and trees often contain
F34 1190  8    a variety of seeds collected during the year.
F34 1200  7       Tradition has assigned medicinal values to seeds
F34 1210  5    because of their alkaloids, aromatic oils, and highly
F34 1220  3    flavored components. Although science has given us
F34 1220 10    more effective materials, preparations from anise,
F34 1230  5    castorbean, colchicum, nux vomica, mustard, fennel,
F34 1240  4    and stramonium are familiar to many for the relief
F34 1250  2    of human ailments. Flaxseed poultices and mustard plasters
F34 1250 10    still are used by some persons.
F34 1260  6       Peanut and sesame oils often are used as carriers
F34 1270  4    or diluents for medicines administered by injection.
F34 1280  1       Still another group of seeds (sometimes tiny, dry,
F34 1290  7    seed-bearing fruits) provide distinctive flavors and
F34 1300  6    odors to foods, although the nutrients they supply
F34 1310  4    are quite negligible. The common spices, flavorings,
F34 1320  1    and condiments make up this group.
F34 1320  7       Each year millions of pounds of anise, caraway,
F34 1330  5    mustard, celery, and coriander and the oils extracted
F34 1340  2    from them are imported.
F34 1340  6       Single-seeded dry fruits used for flavoring include
F34 1350  4    several of the carrot family, such as cumin, dill,
F34 1360  2    fennel, and angelica. Less common seeds used in cooking
F34 1360 11    and beverages include fenugreek (artificial maple flavor)
F34 1370  6    and cardamom. White pepper is the ground seed of the
F34 1380  8    common black pepper fruit.
F34 1390  1       Sesame seed, which comes from the tall pods of a
F34 1390 10    plant grown in Egypt, Brazil, and Central America,
F34 1400  5    has a toasted-nut flavor and can be used in almost
F34 1410  4    any dish calling for almonds. It is a main flavoring
F34 1410 14    for halvah, the candy of the Middle East. Sesame sticks,
F34 1420 10    a snack dip, originated in the Southwest.
F34 1430  5       Beverages are made from seeds the world over.
F34 1440  4       Coffee is made from the roasted and ground seeds
F34 1450  1    of the coffee tree. World production of coffee broke
F34 1450 10    all previous records in 1959 and 1960 at more than
F34 1460  9    5 million tons. Per capita consumption remains around
F34 1470  3    16 pounds in the United States.
F34 1470  9       Cocoa, chocolate, and cocoa butter come from the
F34 1480  8    ground seeds of the cacao tree. World production of
F34 1490  5    about 1 million tons is divided primarily between Africa
F34 1500  2    (63 percent) and South America (27 percent).
F34 1510  1       Several soft drinks contain extracts from kola nuts,
F34 1510  8    the seed of the kola tree cultivated in the West Indies
F34 1520  7    and South America.
F34 1530  1       Cereal grains have been used for centuries to prepare
F34 1530  9    fermented beverages. The Japanese sake is wine fermented
F34 1540  7    from rice grain. Arrack is distilled from fermented
F34 1550  4    rice in India.
F34 1550  7       Beer, generally fermented from barley, is an old
F34 1560  6    alcoholic beverage. Beer was brewed by the Babylonians
F34 1570  2    and Egyptians more than 6 thousand years ago. Brewers
F34 1580  1    today use corn, rice, and malted barley.
F34 1580  8       Distillers use corn, malt, wheat, grain sorghum,
F34 1590  5    and rye in making beverage alcohol.
F34 1590 11    ##
F34 1600  1    SEED CROPS hold a prominent place in the agricultural
F34 1600 10    economy of the United States.
F34 1610  5       The farm value of seeds produced in this country
F34 1620  2    for all purposes, including the cereals, is nearly
F34 1620 10    10 billion dollars a year. Cereal grains, oilseeds,
F34 1630  7    and dry beans and peas account for about 57 percent
F34 1640  5    of the farm value of all crops raised.
F34 1650  1       The economic importance of seed crops actually is
F34 1650  9    even greater, because additional returns are obtained
F34 1660  5    from most of the corn, oats, barley, and sorghum- as
F34 1670  4    well as the cake and meal from the processing of flaxseed,
F34 1680  3    cottonseed, and soybeans- through conversion to poultry,
F34 1690  1    meat, and dairy products.
F34 1690  5       Seeds furnish about 40 percent of the total nutrients
F34 1700  4    consumed by all livestock. Hay and pasture are the
F34 1710  1    other chief sources of livestock feed.
F34 1710  7       Seeds are the essential raw materials for milling
F34 1720  5    grain, baking, crushing oilseed, refining edible oil,
F34 1730  3    brewing, distilling, and mixing feed.
F34 1730  8       More than 11 thousand business establishments in
F34 1740  5    the United States were based on cereals and oilseeds
F34 1750  4    in 1954. The value of products from these industries
F34 1760  1    was 15.8 billion dollars, of which about one-third
F34 1760 10    was created by manufacturing processes. Not included
F34 1770  6    was the value of seed oil in paints and varnishes or
F34 1780  5    the value of the coffee and chocolate industries that
F34 1790  2    are based on imported seed or seed products.
F34 1790 10       Cereal grains furnish about one-fourth of the total
F34 1800  8    food calories in the American diet and about one-third
F34 1810  6    of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock and
F34 1820  2    poultry.
F35 0010  1       To hold a herd of cattle on a new range till they
F35 0010 13    felt at home was called "locatin'" 'em. To keep 'em
F35 0020  8    scattered somewhat and yet herd 'em was called "loose
F35 0030  8    herdin'". To hold 'em in a compact mass was "close
F35 0040  6    herdin'". Cattle were inclined to remain in a territory
F35 0050  4    with which they were acquainted. That became their
F35 0060  1    "home range". Yet there were always some that moved
F35 0060 10    farther and farther out, seekin' grass and water. These
F35 0070  8    became "strays", the term bein' restricted to cattle,
F35 0080  7    however, as hosses, under like circumstances, were
F35 0090  3    spoken of as "stray hosses", not merely "strays".
F35 0100  1       Cattle would drift day and night in a blizzard till
F35 0100 11    it was over. You couldn't stop 'em; you had to go with
F35 0110 12    'em or wait till the storm was over, and follow. Such
F35 0120  9    marchin' in wholesale numbers was called a "drift",
F35 0130  6    or "winter drift", and if the storm was prolonged it
F35 0140  4    usually resulted in one of the tragedies of the range.
F35 0150  2    The cowboy made a technical distinction in reference
F35 0150 10    to the number of them animals. The single animal or
F35 0160  8    a small bunch were referred to as "strays"; but when
F35 0170  6    a large number were "bunched up" or "banded up", and
F35 0180  5    marched away from their home range, as long as they
F35 0190  2    stayed together the group was said to be a "drift".
F35 0190 12    Drifts usually occurred in winter in an effort to escape
F35 0200 10    the severe cold winds, but it could also occur in summer
F35 0210  8    as the result of lack of water or grass because of
F35 0220  4    a drought, or as an aftermath of a stampede. Drifts
F35 0230  1    usually happened only with cattle, for hosses had 'nough
F35 0230 10    sense to avoid 'em, and to find shelter for 'emselves.
F35 0240  8       The wholesale death of cattle as a result of blizzards,
F35 0250  9    and sometimes droughts, over a wide range of territory
F35 0260  6    was called a "die-up". Followin' such an event there
F35 0270  4    was usually a harvest of "fallen hides", and the ranchers
F35 0280  2    needed skinnin' knives instead of brandin' irons. Cattle
F35 0290  1    were said to be "potted" when "blizzard choked", that
F35 0290 10    is, caught in a corner or a draw, or against a "drift
F35 0300 11    fence" durin' a storm. Cattle which died from them
F35 0310  7    winter storms were referred to as the "winter kill".
F35 0320  4    When cattle in winter stopped and humped their backs
F35 0330  2    up they were said to "bow up". This term was also used
F35 0330 14    by the cowboy in the sense of a human showin' fight,
F35 0340 11    as one cowhand was heard to say, "He arches his back
F35 0350  8    like a mule in a hailstorm". Cattle drove to the northern
F35 0360  5    ranges and held for two winters to mature 'em into
F35 0370  3    prime beef were said to be "double wintered".
F35 0380  1       Cattle brought into a range from a distance were
F35 0380  9    called "immigrants". Them new to the country were referred
F35 0390  8    to as "pilgrims". This word was first applied to the
F35 0400  7    imported hot-blooded cattle, but later was more commonly
F35 0410  4    used as reference to a human tenderfoot. Hereford cattle
F35 0420  1    were often called "white faces", or "open-face cattle",
F35 0430  1    and the old-time cowman gave the name of "hothouse
F35 0430 11    stock" to them newly introduced cattle. Because Holstein
F35 0440  6    cattle weren't a beef breed, they were rarely seen
F35 0450  5    on a ranch, though one might be found now and then
F35 0460  2    for the milk supply. The cowboy called this breed of
F35 0460 12    cattle "magpies". A "cattaloe" was a hybrid offspring
F35 0470  7    of buffalo and cattle. "Dry stock" denoted, regardless
F35 0490  5    of age or sex, such bovines as were givin' no milk.
F35 0500  6    A "wet herd" was a herd of cattle made up entirely
F35 0510  3    of cows, while "wet stuff" referred to cows givin'
F35 0520  1    milk. The cowboy's humorous name for a cow givin' milk
F35 0520 11    was a "milk pitcher". Cows givin' no milk were knowed
F35 0530  8    as "strippers". The terminology of the range, in speakin'
F35 0540  8    of "dry stock" and "wet stock", was confusin' to the
F35 0550  7    tenderfoot. The most common reference to "wet stock"
F35 0560  4    was with the meanin' that such animals had been smuggled
F35 0570  3    across the Rio Grande after bein' stolen from their
F35 0580  1    rightful owners. The term soon became used and applied
F35 0580 10    to all stolen animals. "Mixed herd" meant a herd of
F35 0590  8    mixed sexes, while a "straight steer herd" was one
F35 0600  5    composed entirely of steers, and when the cowman spoke
F35 0610  3    of "mixed cattle", he meant cattle of various grades,
F35 0620  1    ages, and sexes.
F35 0620  4       In the spring when penned cattle were turned out
F35 0630  2    to grass, this was spoken of as "turn-out time", or
F35 0630 13    "put to grass". "Shootin' 'em out" was gettin' cattle
F35 0640  9    out of a corral onto the range. When a cow came out
F35 0650 11    of a corral in a crouchin' run she was said to "come
F35 0660  7    out a-stoopin'". To stir cattle up and get 'em heated
F35 0670  6    and excited was to "mustard the cattle", and the act
F35 0680  3    was called "ginnin' 'em 'round", or "chousin' 'em".
F35 0690  2    After a roundup the pushin' of stray cattle of outside
F35 0690 12    brands toward their home range was called "throwin'
F35 0700  8    over".
F35 0720  1       A cow rose from the ground rear end first. By the
F35 0720 12    time her hindquarters were in a standin' position,
F35 0730  6    her knees were on the ground in a prayin' attitude.
F35 0740  2    It was when she was in this position that the name
F35 0750  1    "prayin' cow" was suggested to the cowboy. They were
F35 0750 10    said to be "on their heads" when grazin'. "On the hoof"
F35 0760  9    was a reference to live cattle and was also used in
F35 0770  9    referrin' to cattle travelin' by trail under their
F35 0780  5    own power as against goin' by rail. Shippin' cattle
F35 0790  2    by train was called a "stock run". A general classification
F35 0800  1    given grass-fed cattle was "grassers".
F35 0800  7       When a cowboy spoke of "dustin'" a cow, he meant
F35 0810  8    that he throwed dust into her eyes. The cow, unlike
F35 0820  5    a bull or steer, kept her eyes open and her mind on
F35 0830  3    her business when chargin', and a cow "on the prod"
F35 0830 13    or "on the peck" was feared by the cowhand more than
F35 0840 10    any of his other charges.
F35 0850  2       The Injun's name for beef was "wohaw", and many
F35 0860  1    of the old frontiersmen adopted it from their association
F35 0860 10    with the Injun on the trails. The first cattle the
F35 0870  8    Injuns saw under the white man's control were the ox
F35 0880  6    teams of the early freighters. Listenin' with wonder
F35 0890  3    at the strange words of the bullwhackers as they shouted
F35 0900  1    "Whoa", "Haw", and "Gee", they thought them words the
F35 0910  1    names of the animals, and began callin' cattle "wohaws".
F35 0910 10    Rarely did a trail herd pass through the Injun country
F35 0920 10    on its march north that it wasn't stopped to receive
F35 0930  7    demand for "wohaw".
F35 0930 10       "Tailin'" was the throwin' of an animal by the tail
F35 0940 10    in lieu of a rope. Any animal could when travelin'
F35 0950  7    fast, be sent heels over head by the simple process
F35 0960  5    of overtakin' the brute, seizin' its tail, and givin'
F35 0970  3    the latter a pull to one side. This throwed the animal
F35 0980  1    off balance, and over it'd crash onto its head and
F35 0980 11    shoulders. Though the slightest yank was frequently
F35 0990  6    capable of producin' results, many men assured success
F35 1000  4    through a turn of the tail 'bout the saddle horn, supplemented
F35 1010  3    sometimes, in the case of cattle, by a downward heave
F35 1020  1    of the rider's leg upon the strainin' tail. Such tactics
F35 1020 11    were resorted to frequently with the unmanageable longhorns,
F35 1030  8    and a thorough "tailin'" usually knocked the breath
F35 1040  6    out of a steer, and so dazed 'im that he'd behave for
F35 1050  6    the rest of the day. It required both a quick and swift
F35 1060  5    hoss and a darin' rider. When cattle became more valuable,
F35 1070  2    ranch owners frowned upon this practice and it was
F35 1070 11    discontinued, at least when the boss was 'round. When
F35 1080  9    the cowboy used the word "tailin's", he meant stragglers.
F35 1090  5       "Bull tailin'" was a game once pop'lar with the
F35 1100  8    Mexican cowboys of Texas. From a pen of wild bulls
F35 1110  6    one would be released, and with much yellin' a cowhand'd
F35 1120  2    take after 'im. Seizin' the bull by the tail, he rushed
F35 1130  1    his hoss forward and a little to one side, throwin'
F35 1130 11    the bull off balance, and "bustin'" 'im with terrific
F35 1140  7    force. Rammin' one horn of a downed steer into the
F35 1150  8    ground to hold 'im down was called "peggin'".
F35 1160  2       Colors of cattle came in for their special names.
F35 1170  1    An animal covered with splotches or spots of different
F35 1170 10    colors was called a "brindle" or "brockle". A "lineback"
F35 1180  8    was an animal with a stripe of different color from
F35 1190  8    the rest of its body runnin' down its back, while a
F35 1200  6    "lobo stripe" was the white, yeller, or brown stripe
F35 1210  3    runnin' down the back, from neck to tail, a characteristic
F35 1220  1    of many Spanish cattle. A "mealynose" was a cow or
F35 1220 11    steer of the longhorn type, with lines and dots of
F35 1230  9    a color lighter'n the rest of its body 'round the eyes,
F35 1240  7    face, and nose. Such an animal was said to be "mealynosed".
F35 1250  5    "Sabinas" was a Spanish word used to describe cattle
F35 1260  3    of red and white peppered and splotched colorin'. The
F35 1270  2    northern cowboy called all the red Mexican cattle which
F35 1270 11    went up the trail "Sonora reds", while they called
F35 1280  8    all cattle drove up from Mexico "yaks", because they
F35 1290  5    came from the Yaqui Injun country, or gave 'em the
F35 1300  5    name of "Mexican buckskins". Near the southern border,
F35 1310  2    cattle of the early longhorn breed whose coloration
F35 1310 10    was black with a lineback, with white speckles frequently
F35 1320  8    appearin' on the sides and belly, were called "zorrillas".
F35 1330  7    This word was from the Spanish, meanin' "polecat".
F35 1340  4    "Yeller bellies" were cattle of Mexican breed splotched
F35 1350  5    on flank and belly with yellerish color. An animal
F35 1360  2    with distinct coloration, or other marks easily distinguished
F35 1370  1    and remembered by the owner and his riders, was sometimes
F35 1370 11    used as a "marker". Such an animal has frequently been
F35 1380  8    the downfall of the rustler.
F35 1390  2       Countin' each grazin' bunch of cattle where it was
F35 1400  1    found on the range and driftin' it back so that it
F35 1400 12    didn't mix with the uncounted cattle was called a "range
F35 1410  8    count". The countin' of cattle in a pasture without
F35 1420  7    throwin' 'em together for the purpose was called a
F35 1430  4    "pasture count". The counters rode through the pasture
F35 1440  2    countin' each bunch of grazin' cattle, and drifted
F35 1440 10    it back so that it didn't get mixed with the uncounted
F35 1450 10    cattle ahead. This method of countin' was usually done
F35 1460  7    at the request, and in the presence, of a representative
F35 1470  4    of the bank that held the papers against the herd.
F35 1480  2    Them notes and mortgages were spoken of as "cattle
F35 1480 11    paper".
F35 1490  1       A "book count" was the sellin' of cattle by the
F35 1490 11    books, commonly resorted to in the early days, sometimes
F35 1500  9    much to the profit of the seller. This led to the famous
F35 1510  8    sayin' in the Northwest of the "books won't freeze".
F35 1520  4    This became a common byword durin' the boom days when
F35 1530  4    Eastern and foreign capital were so eager to buy cattle
F35 1540  1    interests. The origin of this sayin' was credited to
F35 1540 10    a saloonkeeper by the name of Luke Murrin. His saloon
F35 1550  9    was a meetin' place for influential Wyoming cattlemen,
F35 1560  4    and one year durin' a severe blizzard, when his herd-owner
F35 1570  5    customers were wearin' long faces, he said, "Cheer
F35 1580  2    up boys, whatever happens, the books won't freeze".
F35 1580 10    In this carefree sentence he summed up the essence
F35 1590  9    of the prevailin' custom of buyin' by book count, and
F35 1600  8    created a sayin' which has survived through the years.
F35 1610  4    "Range delivery" meant that the buyer, after examinin'
F35 1620  2    the seller's ranch records and considerin' his rep'tation
F35 1630  1    for truthfulness, paid for what the seller claimed
F35 1630  9    to own, then rode out and tried to find it.
F35 1640  9       When a cowhand said that a man had "good cow sense",
F35 1650  6    he meant to pay 'im a high compliment. No matter by
F35 1660  4    what name cattle were called, there was no denyin'
F35 1660 13    that they not only saved Texas from financial ruin,
F35 1670  9    but went far toward redeemin' from a wilderness vast
F35 1680  6    territories of the Northwest.
F35 1690  1    #@ 21 @ SWINGIN' A WIDE LOOP#
F35 1690  7    THE first use of the word "rustler" was as a synonym
F35 1700  6    for "hustler", becomin' an established term for any
F35 1710  4    person who was active, pushin', and bustlin' in any
F35 1720  2    enterprise. Again it was used as the title for the
F35 1720 12    hoss wrangler, and when the order was given to go out
F35 1730 10    and "rustle the hosses", it meant for 'im to go out
F35 1740  8    and herd 'em in. Eventually herdin' the hosses was
F35 1750  4    spoken of as "hoss rustlin'", and the wrangler was
F35 1760  1    called the "hoss rustler". Later, the word became almost
F35 1760 10    exclusively applied to a cow thief, startin' from the
F35 1770  9    days of the maverick when cowhands were paid by their
F35 1780  7    employers to "get out and rustle a few mavericks".
F36 0010  1    IT WAS JOHN who found the lion tracks. He found them
F36 0010 12    near the carcass of a zebra that had been killed the
F36 0020  9    night before, and he circled once, nose to the ground,
F36 0030  6    hair shooting up along his back, as it did when he
F36 0040  3    was after lion or bear, and then he lifted his head
F36 0040 14    and bayed, and the pack joined in, all heads high,
F36 0050  9    and Jones knew it was a hot trail.
F36 0060  2       He stifled the Comanche yell and let John lead him
F36 0070  1    straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain.
F36 0070  8    This mountain was known as The Black Reef and it rose
F36 0080  9    almost perpendicularly for about two hundred feet,
F36 0090  4    honeycombed with caves, top covered with dense scrub
F36 0100  1    and creepers and tall grass. On the south it ended
F36 0100 11    sharply as though the lava had been cut off there suddenly.
F36 0110  9       Kearton and Ulyate had started the day together
F36 0120  6    while Jones followed the dogs, and Means and Loveless
F36 0130  3    had taken another route, and now, with the discovery
F36 0140  1    of the fresh trail still unknown to him, Ulyate reined
F36 0140 11    in, in the shadow of the Reef and pointed. Kearton
F36 0150  8    focussed his field glasses.
F36 0160  1       "That's the Colonel", he said, "But I can't see
F36 0160 10    the dogs".
F36 0170  2       As they watched, Jones rode straight for the Reef.
F36 0180  1    Then they picked up the smaller black specks on the
F36 0180 11    plain in front of him. The dogs were working a trail-
F36 0190  9    lion? hyena? The pack had made a bend to the north,
F36 0200  8    swinging back toward the Reef, and Kearton and Ulyate
F36 0210  3    could hear them faintly.
F36 0210  7       Kearton got off and tore up some dry grass that
F36 0220  7    grew in cracks between the rocks and piled it in a
F36 0230  4    heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would
F36 0230 14    bring Loveless and Means and the rest of the party.
F36 0240  9       "Not yet", cautioned Ulyate.
F36 0250  2       Jones came toward them fast, now, along the southern
F36 0260  1    toe of the Reef, and the dogs could be heard plainly,
F36 0260 12    Old John with his Grand Canyon voice outstanding above
F36 0270  8    the others. There was Sounder, too, also a veteran
F36 0280  7    of the North Rim, and Rastus and the Rake from a pack
F36 0290  6    of English fox-hounds, and a collie from a London pound,
F36 0300  2    and Simba, a terrier **h. A motley pack, chosen for
F36 0300 12    effectiveness, not beauty. Jones was galloping close
F36 0310  7    behind them leaning down, cheering them on.
F36 0320  5       "Light it"! Ulyate said, and Kearton touched a match
F36 0330  4    to the pile of grass, blew on it and flame licked out.
F36 0340  2    He threw green stuff on it, and a thin blue column
F36 0340 13    of smoke rose.
F36 0350  1       "That will fetch the gang and tell the Colonel where
F36 0350 11    we are".
F36 0360  2       Two quick shots sounded. Then there was a chorus
F36 0360 11    of wild barking and baying. Then the heavy roar of
F36 0370 10    a lion.
F36 0370 12       Kearton and Ulyate looked at each other and began
F36 0380  9    to gallop toward the sound. It came from the top of
F36 0390  7    the Reef not half a mile away. At the base of the rocky
F36 0400  5    hillside, they left their horses and climbed on foot.
F36 0410  1    The route was choked with rugged lava-rocks, creepers
F36 0410 10    and bushes, so thickly overgrown that when Kearton
F36 0420  6    lost sight of Ulyate and called, Ulyate answered from
F36 0430  4    ten feet away. Nice country to meet a lion in face
F36 0440  2    to face. Ulyate and Kearton climbed on toward the sound
F36 0440 12    of the barking of the dogs and the sporadic roaring
F36 0450  9    of the lion, till they came, out of breath, to the
F36 0460  7    crest, and peering through the branches of a bush,
F36 0470  3    this is what Ulyate saw: Jones who had apparently (and
F36 0470 13    actually had) ridden up the nearly impassable hillside,
F36 0480  8    sitting calmly on his horse within forty feet of a
F36 0490  8    full-grown young lioness, who was crouched on a flat
F36 0500  4    rock and seemed just about to charge him, while the
F36 0510  1    dogs whirled around her.
F36 0510  5       Ulyate drew back with a start, and put finger to
F36 0520  3    lips, almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set
F36 0520 13    her off, "The dogs have got her bayed **h. She's just
F36 0530 11    the other side of that bush"! And when they had drawn
F36 0540  9    back a step he added: "Jones is sitting on his horse
F36 0550  7    right in front of her. Why she doesn't charge him,
F36 0570  3    I don't know. And he hasn't even got a knife on him.
F36 0580  2    He couldn't get away from her in this kind of ground
F36 0580 13    **h. Careful, don't disturb her".
F36 0590  4    ##
F36 0590  5    Jones had been about a hundred and fifty feet from
F36 0600  5    her when he first broke through to the top of the Reef.
F36 0610  2    She was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground
F36 0610 13    and when she saw him she rose to full height and roared,
F36 0620 11    opening her mouth wide, lashing her tail, and stamping
F36 0630  6    at the rock with both forefeet in irritation, as much
F36 0640  4    as to say: "How dare you disturb me in my sacred precinct"?
F36 0650  2       Intuition told him, however, that she was tired
F36 0660  1    and winded from the run up the Reef and would not charge,
F36 0660 13    yet. He moved forward to within thirty-five feet of
F36 0670  9    her, being careful, because he knew the female is less
F36 0680  7    predictable than the male. (In the graveyard at Nairobi
F36 0690  3    he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game
F36 0700  1    hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting
F36 0700  9    to lasso. Of the thirty-four, seventeen had been killed
F36 0710  9    by lions, and eleven out of the seventeen by lionesses.)
F36 0720  6    She snarled terribly but intuition told him, again,
F36 0740  3    that she was bluffing, and he could see that half her
F36 0750  1    attention was distracted by the dogs. He threw the
F36 0750 10    lasso. It was falling over her head when a branch of
F36 0760  8    a bush caught it and it fell in front of her on the
F36 0770  5    rock. Even then, if she took one step forward he could
F36 0780  1    catch her. But John nipped her rear end- one lion's
F36 0780 11    rear end was as good as another to John, Africa, Arizona
F36 0790 10    no matter- and she changed ends and took a swipe at
F36 0800  8    John, but he ducked back.
F36 0810  1       Jones then recoiled his rope and threw again, this
F36 0810  9    time hitting her on the back but failing to encircle
F36 0820  7    her. She whirled and faced him, roaring terribly, and
F36 0830  3    Ulyate, watching through the leaves, could not understand
F36 0840  1    why she did not charge and obliterate him, because
F36 0840 10    he wouldn't have much of a chance of getting away,
F36 0850  9    in that thick growth, but she seemed just a trace uncertain;
F36 0860  6    while Jones, on the other hand, appeared perfectly
F36 0870  2    confident and Ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer.
F36 0880  1       From the lioness' point of view, this strange creature
F36 0890  1    on the back of another creature, lashing out with its
F36 0890 11    long thin paw, very likely appeared as something she
F36 0900  7    could not at first cope with. But now she sank lower
F36 0910  5    to the rock. Her roar changed to a growl. Her tail
F36 0930  1    no longer lashed. Although she appeared more subdued
F36 0930  9    and defeated, Jones knew she was growing more dangerous.
F36 0940  8    She was rested and could mount a charge. Just the tip
F36 0950  7    of her tail was moving as she crouched, and she was
F36 0960  4    treading lightly up and down with her hind feet.
F36 0970  1       At this moment, Loveless and Means arrived, crashing
F36 0970  9    through the undergrowth with their horses, and distracted
F36 0980  6    her, and she ran off a short distance and jumped into
F36 0990  5    a crevice between two rocks. The dogs followed her
F36 1000  2    and she killed three and badly wounded Old John.
F36 1010  1       "We've got to get her out of there"! Jones yelled,
F36 1010 10    "or she'll kill 'em all. Bring me the firecrackers".
F36 1020  8       For such an emergency he had included Fourth-of-July
F36 1030  8    cannon crackers as part of their equipment. Lighting
F36 1040  4    one he pitched it into the crevice, and the lioness
F36 1050  2    left off mauling the dogs and departed.
F36 1050  9       "Ain't she a beauty, though"? called out Means as
F36 1060  8    she ran.
F36 1060 10       "Don't you go a step nearer her than I do", Jones
F36 1070 11    warned, "and if you do, go at a run so you'll have
F36 1080 10    momentum"!
F36 1080 11       For two hours they drove her from one strong point
F36 1090  8    to another along the side of the Reef, trying to maneuver
F36 1100  6    her onto the plain where they could get a good throw.
F36 1110  4    But she clung to the rocks and brush, and the day wore
F36 1120  1    away. It was hot. The dogs were tired. The men were
F36 1120 12    tired too. It was the story of the rhinoceros fight
F36 1130  8    all over again. And the sun was beginning to go down.
F36 1140  5    If dark came they would lose her.
F36 1140 12       "I'll get a pole", Jones said finally, "and I'll
F36 1150  9    poke a noose over her head"!
F36 1170  2       At this moment she was crouched in a cave-like aperture
F36 1180  2    halfway down the Reef. Ulyate made no comment but his
F36 1180 12    face showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions'
F36 1190 10    heads with poles, and of course these were the lions
F36 1200  8    of fifty years ago, not the gentler ones of today,
F36 1210  4    and this one was angry, with good reason. Loveless,
F36 1220  1    too, objected. "It won't work, Colonel".
F36 1220  7       "Just the same we'll try it".
F36 1230  5       But without waiting for them to try it, she scattered
F36 1240  3    the dogs and shot down the Reef and out across the
F36 1240 14    plain.
F36 1250  1       John led the chase after her and the other dogs
F36 1250 11    strung out behind, many of them trailing blood. John
F36 1260  8    himself was bruised and clawed from head to tail, but
F36 1270  7    he was in this fight to the finish, running almost
F36 1280  2    as strongly now as in the morning.
F36 1280  9       She took refuge on a tongue of land extending into
F36 1290  8    a gully, crouched at the base of a thorn tree, and
F36 1300  4    waited for them to come up. She had chosen the spot
F36 1300 15    well. With the gully on three sides, she could be approached
F36 1310 11    only along the tongue of land. "Careful, now", Jones
F36 1320  8    warned.
F36 1320  9       Means tried her first. Very slowly he maneuvered
F36 1330  8    his rawboned bay gelding, edging closer, watching for
F36 1340  5    a chance to throw, but ready to spin and run, rope
F36 1350  3    whining about his head, horse edging tensely under
F36 1350 11    him, but the gelding was obedient and responded and
F36 1360  8    was not paralyzed by the close proximity of the lion.
F36 1370  5    They tell you horses go crazy at the sight or smell
F36 1380  3    of a bear or a lion, but these didn't.
F36 1380 12       Means edged closer. She snarled warningly. Means
F36 1390  6    spit and edged on. Again she snarled, and again he
F36 1400  5    edged. The pony was sidewise to her. With a whirling
F36 1410  1    jump, it could get into gear **h. However nothing on
F36 1410 11    four legs was supposed to be faster than a lion over
F36 1420 10    a short distance, unless it was a cheetah.
F36 1430  5       She charged. Means spun and spurred. For thirty
F36 1440  1    yards she gained rapidly. She was closing and within
F36 1440 10    one more bound would have been able to reach the rear
F36 1450  9    end of the bay, but- and here Jones and Loveless and
F36 1460  6    Ulyate were holding breath for all they were worth-
F36 1470  3    she never quite caught up that last bound. Means held
F36 1480  1    steady one jump ahead of her. Then gradually he began
F36 1480 11    to pull away. A Western cowpony had outrun an African
F36 1490  8    lion, from a standing start. Photos showed later that
F36 1500  5    she'd been about six feet from Means **h. Of course
F36 1510  3    the factor of head start made all the difference. How
F36 1510 13    much head start? No one knew exactly. That was the
F36 1520 10    whole question. Enough, was the answer.
F36 1530  5       The lioness quickly changed front, when she saw
F36 1550  3    she couldn't catch Means, and made for Jones. As she
F36 1550 13    had done with Means, she gained rapidly at first, but
F36 1560 10    then Baldy began to draw away. Somewhere in the few
F36 1570  8    scant yards of head start was the determining point.
F36 1580  3       When Jones too drew away, she returned to a thorn
F36 1590  3    bush in the neck of land running into the gully, crouched
F36 1590 14    low and waited as before. This new position, however,
F36 1600  9    gave the ropers a better chance. There was room to
F36 1610  7    make a quick dash past the bush and throw as you went.
F36 1620  5    So: Means edged around on the north side of her, Jones
F36 1630  2    moved in from the south. Tossing his rope and shouting
F36 1630 12    he attracted her attention. He succeeded almost too
F36 1640  7    well, because once she rose as if to charge, and he
F36 1650  8    half wheeled his horse- he was within fifty feet- but
F36 1660  4    she sank back.
F36 1660  7       From behind her Means shot forward at a run. Kearton
F36 1670  6    began shouting, "Wait, wait- the camera's jammed"!
F36 1680  2    But Means kept on. He raced by within twenty feet of
F36 1690  2    her, roped her around the neck, but a lioness' neck
F36 1690 12    is short and thick and with a quick twist she slipped
F36 1700  9    the noose off.
F37 0010  1    The missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to
F37 0010  9    all the world was once left to zealous individuals
F37 0020  6    and voluntary societies. But the time came when a church
F37 0030  5    that had no part in the missionary movement was looked
F37 0040  2    upon as deficient in its essential life. The Christian
F37 0040 11    education of children, too, was once hardly more than
F37 0050  9    a sideshow, but the day came when a congregation that
F37 0060  6    did not assume full oversight of a church school was
F37 0070  3    thought of as failing in its duty.
F37 0070 10       The most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement
F37 0080  6    today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility
F37 0090  5    of a few national leaders in each denomination and
F37 0100  2    a few interdenominational executives. Most pastors
F37 0100  8    and laymen, even though they believe it to be important,
F37 0110  9    assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the
F37 0120  5    province of their parishes. They may even dismiss it
F37 0130  4    from their minds as something that concerns only the
F37 0140  1    "ecclesiastical Rover Boys", as someone has dubbed
F37 0140  8    them, who like to go to national and international
F37 0150  7    assemblies, and have expense accounts that permit them
F37 0160  4    to do so.
F37 0160  7       As long as this point of view prevails, the ecumenical
F37 0170  4    movement will be lame and halt. The next stage ahead
F37 0180  3    is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local
F37 0180 14    community. Progress will take place far less through
F37 0190  8    what is done in any "summit conference" of the National
F37 0200  6    Council or the World Council, or even in offices of
F37 0210  6    the denominational boards, than through what happens
F37 0220  2    in the communities where Christian people live together
F37 0220 10    as neighbors. The front line of advance is where witnessing
F37 0230  9    and worshiping congregations of different traditions
F37 0250  5    exist side by side. Until they see the ecumenical movement
F37 0260  5    in terms of the difference it makes in their own attitudes,
F37 0270  3    programs, and relationships, it will have an inevitable
F37 0280  1    aspect of unreality. As things now stand, there is
F37 0280 10    a grievous disparity between the unity in Christ which
F37 0290  7    we profess in ecumenical meetings and the complacent
F37 0300  4    separateness of most congregations on any Main Street
F37 0310  2    in the nation.
F37 0310  5    #THE ECUMENICAL CONGREGATION#
F37 0310  8    The crux of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized
F37 0320  9    matter than the relation between congregations in the
F37 0330  5    same community. The decisive question is what happens
F37 0340  4    within each congregation and, finally, in the minds
F37 0350  2    and hearts of the individual members. It is here that
F37 0350 12    the local and ecumenical must meet. It is here that
F37 0360  9    the ecumenical must become local and the local become
F37 0370  6    ecumenical.
F37 0370  7       It has become almost trite to say that the ecumenical
F37 0380  7    movement must be "carried down to the grass roots".
F37 0390  3    This way of describing the matter is unfortunate. It
F37 0400  2    implies two misconceptions. One is that whatever is
F37 0400 10    ecumenical has to do with some over-all organization
F37 0410  8    at "the top" and needs only to be understood at the
F37 0420  6    so-called "lower levels". The truth, however, is that
F37 0430  3    the ecumenical church is just the local church in its
F37 0440  1    own true character as an integral unit of the whole
F37 0440 11    People of God throughout the world. The other misconception
F37 0450  7    is that our ecumenical problems will be solved if only
F37 0460  7    the knowledge of the church in its world-wide extension
F37 0470  2    and its interdenominational connections, now comprehended
F37 0480  1    by many national leaders, can be communicated to all
F37 0480 10    congregations. However needed this may be, the fundamental
F37 0490  8    problem is not information but active commitment to
F37 0500  5    the total mission of the church of Christ in the world.
F37 0510  4       The basic unit in the church, of whatever denominational
F37 0520  1    polity, is always the congregation. It is hardly possible
F37 0530  1    to emphasize this too much. Most people do not realize
F37 0530 11    that the congregation, as a gathered fellowship meeting
F37 0540  6    regularly face to face, personally sharing in a common
F37 0550  5    experience and expressing that experience in daily
F37 0560  3    relationships with one another, is unique. The idea
F37 0560 11    that it is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken.
F37 0570 10    The Jewish synagogue affords a parallel to the Christian
F37 0580  7    congregation, but Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Confucianism,
F37 0590  4    Taoism, Shintoism, although they have sacred scriptures,
F37 0600  4    priests, spiritual disciplines, and places of prayer,
F37 0610  2    do not have a congregation as a local household of
F37 0610 12    faith and love. Their characteristic experience is
F37 0620  6    that of the individual at an altar or a shrine rather
F37 0630  6    than that of a continuing social group with a distinctive
F37 0640  3    kind of fellowship.
F37 0640  6       How far the fellowship in most local churches falls
F37 0650  4    below what the New Testament means by koinonia! What
F37 0660  2    is now called Christian fellowship is often little
F37 0660 10    more than the social chumminess of having a gracious
F37 0670  9    time with the kind of people one likes. The koinonia
F37 0680  7    of Acts and of the Epistles means sharing in a common
F37 0690  6    relation to Christ. It is an experience of a new depth
F37 0700  4    of community derived from an awareness of the corporate
F37 0710  1    indwelling of Christ in His people. As Dietrich Bonho^ffer
F37 0710 10    puts it, "Our community with one another consists solely
F37 0720  9    in what Christ has done to both of us". This may mean
F37 0730 10    having fellowship in the church with people with whom,
F37 0740  5    on the level of merely human agreeableness, we might
F37 0750  3    prefer not to have any association at all. There is
F37 0750 13    a vast difference between the community of reconciliation
F37 0760  7    which the New Testament describes and the community
F37 0770  5    of congeniality found in the average church building.
F37 0780  3       Whenever a congregation really sees itself as a
F37 0790  3    unit in the universal Church, in vital relation with
F37 0790 12    the whole Body of Christ and participating in His mission
F37 0800  9    to the world, a necessary foundation-stone of the ecumenical
F37 0810  6    movement has been laid. The antithesis of the ecumenical
F37 0820  5    and the local then no longer exists. The local and
F37 0830  3    the ecumenical are one.
F37 0830  7       Of course, the perspective of those who are dealing
F37 0840  6    directly with the world-wide problems of the People
F37 0850  2    of God will always be different from the perspective
F37 0850 11    of those who are dealing with the nearby problems of
F37 0860  9    particular persons in a particular place. Each viewpoint
F37 0870  5    is valid if it is organically related to the other.
F37 0880  4    Neither is adequate if it stands alone. Our difficulty
F37 0890  1    arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other. And
F37 0890 10    this is what all too often happens.
F37 0900  5    #DIVERGENT PERSPECTIVES#
F37 0900  7    A little parable illustrative of this truth is afforded
F37 0910  7    by an incident related by Professor Bela Vasady at
F37 0920  4    the end of the Second World War. With great difficulty
F37 0930  2    he made his way from his native Hungary to Geneva to
F37 0930 13    renew his contacts as a member of the Provisional Committee
F37 0940 10    for the World Council of Churches. When he had the
F37 0950  8    mishap of breaking his spectacles, his ecumenical colleagues
F37 0960  4    insisted on providing him with new ones. They were
F37 0970  4    bifocals. He often spoke of them as his "ecumenical"
F37 0980  1    glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision
F37 0980 13    that is required in the church. It is, he said, a bifocal
F37 0990 11    vision, which can see both the near-at-hand and the
F37 1000  9    distant and keep a Christian in right relation to both.
F37 1010  4       As things stand now, the local and the ecumenical
F37 1020  1    tend to compete with each other. On the one hand, there
F37 1020 12    are ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of
F37 1030 10    the church in its encounter with the world at large
F37 1040  6    that they have no eyes for what the church is doing
F37 1050  3    in their own town. They do not escape the pitfall into
F37 1050 14    which Charles Dickens pictured Mrs& Jellyby as falling.
F37 1060  8    Her concern for the natives of Borrioboola-Gha was
F37 1070  8    so intense that she quite forgot and neglected her
F37 1080  5    son Peepy! Likewise, the ecumenist may become so absorbed
F37 1090  3    in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian
F37 1100  1    state in East Germany, the precarious situation of
F37 1100  9    the church in revolutionary China, and the anguish
F37 1110  5    of the church over apartheid in South Africa that he
F37 1120  4    loses close contact with the parish church in its unspectacular
F37 1130  2    but indispensable ministry of worship, pastoral service
F37 1140  1    and counseling, and Christian nurture for a face-to-face
F37 1140 11    group of individuals.
F37 1150  1       On the other hand, many a pastor is so absorbed
F37 1150 11    in ministering to the intimate, personal needs of individuals
F37 1160  8    in his congregation that he does little or nothing
F37 1170  7    to lead them into a sense of social responsibility
F37 1180  2    and world mission. As a result, they go on thinking
F37 1190  1    of the church, with introverted and self-centered satisfaction,
F37 1190 10    only in connection with the way in which it serves
F37 1200 10    them and their families. It would hardly be an exaggeration
F37 1210  7    to say that ninety per cent of the energy of most churches-
F37 1220  6    whether in terms of finance or spiritual concern- is
F37 1230  2    poured into the private and domestic interests of the
F37 1240  1    members. The parish lives for itself rather than for
F37 1240 10    the community or the world.
F37 1250  3       The gap between the ecumenical perspective and the
F37 1260  1    parish perspective appears most starkly in a church
F37 1260  9    in any of our comfortable suburbs. It is eminently
F37 1270  5    successful according to all conventional standards.
F37 1280  2    It is growing in numbers. Its people are agreeable
F37 1290  1    friends. It has a beautiful edifice. Its preaching
F37 1290  9    and its music give refreshment of spirit to men and
F37 1300  7    women living under heavy strain. It provides pastoral
F37 1310  3    care for the sick and troubled. It helps children grow
F37 1320  2    up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the Bible.
F37 1320 12    It draws young people into the circle of those who
F37 1330  9    continue the life of the church from generation to
F37 1340  5    generation. And it is easy for the ecumenical enthusiast
F37 1350  2    to lose sight of how basic all this is.
F37 1350 11       But what is this church doing to help its members
F37 1360  9    understand their roles as Christians in the world?
F37 1370  4    All too often its conception of parish ministry and
F37 1380  2    pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in
F37 1380 10    their relation to issues of the most desperate urgency
F37 1390  8    for the life of mankind. It is not stirring them to
F37 1400  7    confront the racial tensions of today with the mind
F37 1410  3    of Christ. It is not helping them face the moral crisis
F37 1420  1    involved in the use of nuclear energy. It is not making
F37 1420 12    them sensitive to the sub-Christian level of much of
F37 1430  9    our economic and industrial life. It is raising no
F37 1440  6    disturbing question as to what Christian stewardship
F37 1450  1    means for the relationship of the richest nation in
F37 1450 10    the world to economically underdeveloped peoples. It
F37 1460  6    is not developing an awareness of the new kind of missionary
F37 1470  7    strategy that is called for as young churches emerge
F37 1480  3    in Asia and Africa.
F37 1480  7       To put it bluntly, many a local church is giving
F37 1490  6    its members only what they consciously want. It is
F37 1500  3    not disturbing them by thoughts of their Christian
F37 1500 11    responsibility in relation to the world. We shall not
F37 1510  9    make a decisive advance in the ecumenical movement
F37 1520  5    until such a church begins to see itself not merely
F37 1530  2    as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of Christian
F37 1530 15    witness and mission to the world.
F37 1540  6       There is a humorous but revealing story about a
F37 1550  4    rancher who owned a large slice of Texas and who wanted
F37 1560  1    to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely
F37 1560 12    pleasant community. He built a school and a library,
F37 1570  9    then a recreation center and an inn. Desiring to fill
F37 1580  7    the only remaining lack, he selected the best site
F37 1590  4    on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in
F37 1590 15    erecting it. A visitor to the beautiful little building
F37 1600  9    inquired, "Do you belong to this church, Mr& Rancher"?
F37 1610  8    "Why, no, ma'am", he replied, "this church belongs
F37 1620  6    to me"! The story reflects the way too many people
F37 1630  6    feel. As long as the congregation regards the church
F37 1640  3    as "our" church, or the minister thinks of it as "my"
F37 1650  1    church, just so long the ecumenical movement will make
F37 1650 10    no significant advance. There must first be a deeper
F37 1660  8    sense that the church belongs not to us but to Christ,
F37 1670  7    and that it is His purpose, not our own interests and
F37 1680  2    preferences, that determines what it is to be and do.
F37 1680 12    #LOCAL EMBODIMENT OF THE WHOLE#
F37 1690  5    A local church which conceives its function to be entirely
F37 1700  4    that of ministering to the conscious desires and concerns
F37 1710  2    of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical
F37 1710 11    as an extra, not as a normal aspect of its own life
F37 1720 11    as a church. It would doubtless be greatly surprised
F37 1730  5    to be told that in failing to be ecumenical it is really
F37 1740  4    failing to be the Church of Christ.
F37 1740 11       Yet the truth, according to the New Testament, is
F37 1750  8    that every local church has its existence only by being
F37 1760  7    the embodiment of the whole church in that particular
F37 1770  3    place.
F38 0010  1    Yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the
F38 0010 13    city try to match the boys from the neighboring farms;
F38 0020  7    and buggies and wagons and chugging Fords kept gathering
F38 0030  4    all morning, until the edges of the field were packed
F38 0040  3    thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing
F38 0040 13    field to make fun of the visitors- whose pitcher was
F38 0050 10    a formidable looking young man with the only baseball
F38 0060  7    cap.
F38 0060  8       This was a bitterly fought game, carrying almost
F38 0070  5    as much grudge as a fist fight, with no friendliness
F38 0080  2    exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness
F38 0090  1    that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules
F38 0090  9    and agreements on balls that went into the crowd. Every
F38 0100  7    pitch in the game brought forth a howl from the enraptured
F38 0110  6    audience and every fly ball the visitors dropped (and
F38 0120  3    because their right fielder was still a little fuzzy
F38 0120 12    from drink, they dropped many) called forth yelps of
F38 0130  9    derision.
F38 0130 10       At one point in the game when the skinny old man
F38 0140 11    in suspenders who was acting as umpire got in the way
F38 0150  7    of a thrown ball and took it painfully in the kidneys,
F38 0160  3    he lay there unattended while players and spectators
F38 0160 11    wrangled over whether the ball was "dead" or the base
F38 0170 10    runners were free to score.
F38 0180  4       This was typical of such games, which were earnestly
F38 0190  1    played to win and practically never wound up in an
F38 0190 11    expression of good fellowship. When the visitors, after
F38 0200  7    losing this game, rode along the village streets toward
F38 0210  5    home, the youngsters who could keep abreast of them
F38 0220  3    for a moment or two screamed triumphantly, "You bunch
F38 0220 12    of hay-shakers! G'ahn back home! You hay-shakers"!
F38 0240  1       Baseball was surely the national game in those days,
F38 0240  9    even though professional baseball may have been merely
F38 0250  6    a business. Radio broadcasts had not begun and most
F38 0260  5    devotees of baseball attended the games near home,
F38 0270  1    in the town park or a pasture, with perhaps two or
F38 0270 12    three trips to the city each season to see the Cubs
F38 0280  8    or the Pirates or the Indians or the Red Sox.
F38 0290  4       Young men in school could look forward to playing
F38 0300  1    ball for money in a dozen different places, even if
F38 0300 11    they failed to make the major leagues. Nearly any lad
F38 0310  8    with a modicum of skill might find a payday awaiting
F38 0320  5    him in the Three ~I League, or the Pony League, or
F38 0330  3    the Coastal Plains League, or the fast Eastern League,
F38 0340  1    if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues
F38 0340 12    that abounded everywhere. Even a city of thirty thousand
F38 0350  7    might have six baseball teams, sponsored by grocers
F38 0360  4    and hardware merchants or department stores, that played
F38 0370  3    two or three times a week throughout the summer, usually
F38 0370 13    in the cool of the evening, before an earnest and partisan
F38 0380 11    audience who did not begrudge a quarter each, or even
F38 0390  9    more, to be dropped into a hat when the game was half
F38 0400  6    over.
F38 0400  7       Babe Ruth, of course, was everyone's hero, and everyone
F38 0410  4    knew him, even though relatively few ever saw him play
F38 0420  4    ball. His face was always in the newspapers, sometimes
F38 0430  1    in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life. As
F38 0430 11    the twenties grew older, and as radio broadcasts of
F38 0440  7    baseball games began to involve more and more people
F38 0450  4    daily in the doings of the professionals, the great
F38 0460  1    hitters (always led by Babe Ruth) overshadowed the
F38 0460  9    game so that pitchers were nearly of no account. Boys
F38 0470  7    no longer bothered learning to bunt and even school
F38 0480  5    kids scorned to "choke up" on a bat as Willie Keeler
F38 0490  2    and the famous hitters of another day had done.
F38 0490 11       Other hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in
F38 0500  9    the news and a few even dared to dream of matching
F38 0510  5    Ruth, who was still called Jidge by all his friends,
F38 0520  2    or Leo or Two-Head by those who dared to taunt him
F38 0520 14    (Leo was the name of the ball player he liked the least)
F38 0530 12    and who called most of the world "Kid". Lou Gehrig
F38 0540  7    was given the nickname Buster, and he ran Ruth a close
F38 0550  7    race in home runs. But the nickname never stuck and
F38 0560  3    Gehrig was no match for Ruth in "color"- which is sometimes
F38 0570  1    a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the
F38 0570 11    field. Ruth was a delinquent boy still, but he was
F38 0580  9    in every way a great ball player who was out to win
F38 0590  7    the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone to
F38 0600  2    do it.
F38 0600  4       A few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities,
F38 0610  1    with the encouragement of the press, so that they might
F38 0620  1    see their names in big black print, along with Daddy
F38 0620 11    Browning's, Al Capone's, Earl Sande's, and the Prince
F38 0630  8    of Wales'. One who, for a time, succeeded best and
F38 0640  3    was still the sorriest of all was Charles Arthur Shires,
F38 0650  3    who called himself, in the newspapers, Art the Great,
F38 0660  2    or The Great Shires. It was his brag that he could
F38 0660 13    beat everybody at anything, but especially at fighting,
F38 0670  8    and he once took on the manager of his club and worked
F38 0680  8    him over thoroughly with his fists. he was given to
F38 0690  5    public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond;
F38 0700  1    and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass
F38 0700 12    knuckles in Art's pocket once when he had occasion
F38 0710  9    to collar the Great First Baseman for some forgotten
F38 0720  5    reason. (This made a sportswriter named Pegler wonder
F38 0730  3    in print if Art had worn this armament when he defeated
F38 0740  1    his manager.) The sorry fact about this young man,
F38 0740 10    who was barely of age when he broke into major-league
F38 0750  9    baseball, was that he really was a better ball player
F38 0760  6    than he was given credit for being- never so good as
F38 0770  3    he claimed, and always an irritant to his associates,
F38 0770 12    but a good steady performer when he could fight down
F38 0780  9    the temptation to orate on his skills or cut up in
F38 0790  8    public.
F38 0790  9       In his minor way Charles Arthur Shires was perhaps
F38 0800  5    more typical of his era than Ruth was, for he was but
F38 0810  4    one of many young men who laid waste their talents
F38 0810 14    in these Scott Fitzgerald days for the sake of earning
F38 0820  9    space in the newspapers. There were others who climbed
F38 0830  6    flagpoles and refused to come down; or who ingested
F38 0840  4    strange objects, like live fish; or who undertook to
F38 0850  2    set records for remaining erect on a dance floor, with
F38 0850 12    or without a partner; or who essayed to down full bottles
F38 0860 10    of illicit gin without pausing for breath. One young
F38 0870  6    man, exhilarated to the point of insanity by liquor
F38 0880  3    and the excitement of the moment, performed a perfect
F38 0890  1    swan dive out of the stands at the Yale Bowl during
F38 0890 12    the Yale-Army football game, landed squarely on his
F38 0900  7    head on the concrete ramp below, and died at once.
F38 0910  5       But the twenties were not all insanity and a striving
F38 0920  3    after recognition. The business of baseball began to
F38 0920 11    prosper along with other entertainments, and performers-
F38 0930  7    thanks partly to George Herman Ruth's spectacular efforts
F38 0940  6    each season to run his salary higher and higher- prospered
F38 0950  6    too. While fifty years before, Albert Goodwill Spalding,
F38 0960  4    secretary of the Chicago Ball Club of the National
F38 0970  3    League, could write earnestly to the manager of the
F38 0970 12    Buffalo club and request a guarantee of one hundred
F38 0980  9    dollars for a baseball game in August, in this Golden
F38 0990  7    Era a game at the Yankee Stadium might bring in nearly
F38 1000  5    a hundred thousand dollars at the gate. And while less
F38 1010  3    than ten years earlier the wayward Black Sox- all of
F38 1010 13    them top performers in their positions- had toiled
F38 1020  8    for stingy Charles Comiskey at salaries ranging from
F38 1030  6    twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five hundred dollars
F38 1040  3    a year, stars now were asking ten thousand dollars,
F38 1050  1    twenty thousand dollars, yes, even fifty thousand dollars
F38 1050  9    a season.
F38 1060  1       The greatest team of this period was unquestionably
F38 1060  9    the New York Yankees, bought by brewery millions and
F38 1070  8    made into a ball club by men named Ed Barrow and Miller
F38 1080  8    Huggins. Boston fans sometimes liked to wring some
F38 1090  5    wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the great
F38 1100  2    1923-27 crew were graduates of the Red Sox- sold to
F38 1100 13    millionaires Huston and Ruppert by a man who could
F38 1110  9    not deny them their most trifling desire. Ruth himself,
F38 1120  5    still owning his farm in Massachusetts and an interest
F38 1130  4    in the Massachusetts cigar business that printed his
F38 1140  2    round boyish face on the wrappers, had led the parade
F38 1140 12    down from Fenway Park, followed by pitchers Carl Mays,
F38 1150  7    Leslie "Joe" Bush, Waite Hoyt, Herb Pennock, and Sam
F38 1160  7    Jones, catcher Wally Schang, third baseman Joe Dugan
F38 1170  5    (who completed the "playboy trio" of Ruth, Dugan, and
F38 1180  4    Hoyt), and shortstop Everett Scott. By 1926, when the
F38 1190  2    mighty Yanks were at their mightiest, only a few of
F38 1190 12    these were left but they still shone brightest, even
F38 1200  8    beside able and agile rookies like Tony Lazzeri (who
F38 1210  5    managed never to have one of his epileptic fits on
F38 1220  3    the field), Mark Koenig, Lou Gehrig, George Pipgras,
F38 1220 11    and gray-thatched Earl Combs. The deeds of this team,
F38 1230 10    through two seasons and in the two World's Series that
F38 1240  8    followed, have been written and talked about until
F38 1250  5    hardly a word is left to be said. But there is one
F38 1260  3    small episode that a few New York fans who happened
F38 1260 13    to sit in the cheap seats for one World's Series game
F38 1270  9    in 1926 like best to recall. Babe Ruth, as he always
F38 1280  7    did in the Stadium, played right field to avoid having
F38 1290  4    the sun in his eyes, and Tommy Thevenow, a rather mediocre
F38 1300  2    hitter who played shortstop for the St& Louis Cardinals,
F38 1310  1    knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle
F38 1310 12    formed by the permanent stands and the wooden bleachers,
F38 1320  7    where Ruth could not reach it. The ball lay there,
F38 1330  6    shining white on the grass in view of nearly every
F38 1340  2    fan in the park while Ruth, red-necked with frustration,
F38 1340 12    charged about the small patch of ground screaming,
F38 1350  8    "Where's the -ing ball"? But, as he snarled unhappily
F38 1360  7    when the inning was over, "not a sonofabitch in the
F38 1370  6    place would tell me", so little Tommy ran all the way
F38 1380  5    home.
F38 1380  6       The ordinary man and woman, however, saw little
F38 1390  2    of the great professional games of those Golden Days,
F38 1390 11    or of any other sporting event for that matter. Promoters
F38 1400  9    always hastened to place their choice tickets in the
F38 1410  8    hands of the wealthy speculators, and only the man
F38 1420  5    who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in
F38 1430  1    with the guy at the box office ever came up with a
F38 1430 13    good seat for a contest of any importance. Radio broadcasts,
F38 1440  6    however- now that even plain people could afford "loud
F38 1450  5    speakers" on their sets- held old fans to the major-league
F38 1460  6    races and attracted new ones, chiefly women, who through
F38 1470  3    what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality
F38 1470 10    of audition, became first inured, then attracted, then
F38 1480  7    addicted to the long afternoon recitals of the doings
F38 1490  6    in some distant baseball park.
F38 1500  1       In some cities games were broadcast throughout the
F38 1500  9    week and then on weekends the announcer was silenced,
F38 1510  6    and fans must needs drive to the city from all the
F38 1520  5    broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring.
F38 1530  1    This had a pleasant effect upon the Sunday gate receipts
F38 1530 11    as well as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies,
F38 1540 11    some of which began to offer special excursion rates,
F38 1550  6    including seats at the park, just as the trolley and
F38 1560  5    ferry companies had when baseball was new.
F38 1570  1       While women had always attended ball games in small
F38 1570 10    numbers (it was the part of a "dead game sport" in
F38 1580  8    the early years of the twentieth century to be taken
F38 1590  5    out to the ball park and to root, root, root for the
F38 1600  2    home team), they had often sat in patient martyrdom,
F38 1600 11    unable even to read the scoreboard, which sometimes
F38 1610  6    seemed to indicate that one team led another by a score
F38 1630  6    of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and fifty-one.
F38 1640  3    The questions women asked at baseball games were standard
F38 1650  1    grist for amateur comedy, as were the doings of women
F38 1650 11    automobile drivers; for every grown man (except a few
F38 1660  8    who were always suspected of being shy on virility)
F38 1670  5    knew at least the fundamentals of baseball, just as
F38 1680  2    every male American in this era liked to imagine (or
F38 1680 12    pretend) that he could fight with his fists. And women
F38 1690  9    were not expected to know that the pitcher was trying
F38 1700  6    not to let the batter hit the ball.
F38 1710  1       Radio, however, so increased the interest of women
F38 1710  9    in the game that it was hardly necessary even to have
F38 1720  9    "Ladies' Days" any longer to enable men to get to the
F38 1730  8    ball park without interference at home. Women actually
F38 1740  3    began to appear unaccompanied in the stands, where
F38 1750  1    they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home
F38 1750 10    with a tobacco-juice stain on a clean skirt or a new
F38 1760  9    curse word tingling their ears.
F38 1770  1       The radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently
F38 1770  9    informative, despite the baseball jargon, that girls
F38 1780  7    and women could begin to store up in their minds the
F38 1790  7    same sort of random and meaningless statistics that
F38 1800  2    small boys had long learned better than they ever did
F38 1800 12    their lessons in school.
F39 0010  1    This conclusion is dependent on the assumption that
F39 0010  9    traditional sex mores will continue to sanction both
F39 0020  6    premarital chastity as the "ideal", and the double
F39 0030  4    standard holding females primarily responsible for
F39 0040  1    preserving the ideal.
F39 0040  4       Our discussion of this involves using Erik Erikson's
F39 0050  3    schema of "identity vs& identity diffusion" as a conceptual
F39 0060  4    tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto
F39 0070  1    the diverse personality and family configurations of
F39 0070  8    the unwed mothers from whose case histories we quoted
F39 0080  7    earlier. Our discussion does not utilize all the identity
F39 0090  5    crises postulated by Erikson, but is intended to demonstrate
F39 0100  3    the utility of his theoretical schema for studying
F39 0110  1    unwed mothers. We hope thereby to emphasize that, from
F39 0110 10    a psychological standpoint, the effectual prevention
F39 0120  5    of illegitimacy is a continuous long-term process involving
F39 0130  5    the socialization of the female from infancy through
F39 0140  2    adolescence.
F39 0140  3       Hypothesizing a series of developmental stages that
F39 0150  3    begin in the individual's infancy and end in his old
F39 0160  1    age, Erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced
F39 0160 10    with a series of identity crises. The successful and
F39 0170  7    positive resolution of these crises during adolescence
F39 0180  4    involves an epigenetic principle- during adolescence,
F39 0190  2    the individual's positive resolutions in each area
F39 0190  9    of identity crisis depend, to a considerable degree,
F39 0200  7    on his already having resolved preliminary and preparatory
F39 0210  5    identity crises during his infancy, childhood, and
F39 0220  3    early adolescence. Within Erikson's schema, the adolescent's
F39 0230  2    delinquent behavior- in this case, her unwed motherhood-
F39 0240  3    reflects her "identity diffusion", or her inability
F39 0240 10    to resolve these various identity crises positively.
F39 0250  6       The adolescent experiences identity crises in terms
F39 0260  6    of time perspective vs& time diffusion. Time perspective-
F39 0270  3    the ability to plan for the future and to postpone
F39 0280  3    gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range
F39 0290  1    objectives- is more easily developed if, from infancy
F39 0290  8    on, the individual has been able to rely on and trust
F39 0300  9    people and the world in which she lives. Erikson has
F39 0310  5    noted that, unless this trust developed early, the
F39 0320  2    time ambivalence experienced, in varying degree and
F39 0320  9    temporarily, by all adolescents (as a result of their
F39 0330  9    remembering the more immediate gratification of wants
F39 0340  4    during childhood, while not yet having fully accepted
F39 0350  2    the long-range planning required by adulthood) may
F39 0350 10    develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion.
F39 0360  9    Experience of this time diffusion ranges from a sense
F39 0370  6    of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate urgency to
F39 0380  3    act immediately.
F39 0380  5       These polar extremes in time diffusion were indicated
F39 0390  4    in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported in
F39 0400  2    earlier chapters. Some of these mothers, apparently
F39 0400  9    feeling a desperate urgency, made, on the spur of the
F39 0410  9    moment, commitments, in love and sex, that would have
F39 0420  6    life-long consequences. Others displayed utter apathy
F39 0430  3    and indifference to any decision about the past or
F39 0430 12    the future. For many of these unwed mothers, the data
F39 0440  9    on their family life and early childhood experiences
F39 0450  5    revealed several indications and sources of their basic
F39 0460  2    mistrust of their parents in particular and of the
F39 0460 11    world in general.
F39 0470  2       However, as Erickson has noted, the individual's
F39 0480  1    failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy
F39 0480  8    and childhood need not be irreversibly deterministic
F39 0490  6    with respect to a given area of identity diffusion
F39 0500  3    in his (or her) adolescence. And, as shown in Chapter
F39 0510  1    /6,, some ~SNP females originally developed such trust
F39 0510  9    only during their adolescence, through the aid of,
F39 0520  8    and their identification with, alter-parents. In the
F39 0530  6    specific case of time diffusion, we must emphasize
F39 0540  3    the significance of the earlier development of mistrust
F39 0560  1    when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis
F39 0560 10    experienced by most (if not all) adolescents in our
F39 0570  8    society, and with the failure of the adolescent period
F39 0580  4    to provide opportunities for developing trust.
F39 0590  1       The adolescent experiences two closely related crises:
F39 0590  8    self-certainty vs& an identity consciousness; and
F39 0600  6    role-experimentation
F39 0610  1    vs& negative identity. A sense of self-certainty and
F39 0610 10    the freedom to experiment with different roles, or
F39 0620  7    confidence in one's own unique behavior as an alternative
F39 0630  5    to peer-group conformity, is more easily developed
F39 0640  2    during adolescence if, during early childhood, the
F39 0640  9    individual was permitted to exercise initiative and
F39 0650  7    encouraged to develop some autonomy.
F39 0660  2       However, if the child has been constantly surrounded,
F39 0670  1    during nursery and early school age, by peer groups;
F39 0670 10    inculcated with the primacy of group acceptance and
F39 0680  8    group standards; and allowed little initiative in early
F39 0690  5    play and work patterns- then in adolescence her normal
F39 0700  3    degree of vanity, sensitivity, and preoccupation with
F39 0710  1    whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable,
F39 0710  9    will be compounded. Her ostensible indifference to
F39 0720  5    and rebellion against suggestions and criticisms by
F39 0730  4    anyone except peer friends during adolescence are the
F39 0740  3    manifestations, in her adolescence, of her having been
F39 0740 11    indoctrinated in childhood to feel shame, if not guilt,
F39 0750  9    for failing to behave in a manner acceptable to, and
F39 0760  7    judged by, the performance of her nursery- and elementary-school
F39 0770  4    peer friends. To be different is to invite shame and
F39 0780  3    doubt; and it is better to be shamed and criticized
F39 0780 13    by one's parents, who already consider one different
F39 0790  7    and difficult to understand, than by one's peers, who
F39 0800  6    are also experiencing a similar groping for and denial
F39 0810  4    of adult status.
F39 0810  7       The attitudes of some unwed mothers quoted in Chapter
F39 0820  5    /2,, revealed both considerable preoccupation with
F39 0830  2    being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty.
F39 0840  1    Many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a
F39 0840 10    justifiable means of gaining acceptance from and identification
F39 0850  8    with others; but very few seemed aware that such acceptance
F39 0860  8    and identification need to be supplemented with more
F39 0870  6    enduring and stable identification of and with one's
F39 0880  3    self.
F39 0880  4       Another identity crisis confronting the adolescent
F39 0890  2    involves anticipation of achievement vs& work-paralysis.
F39 0900  1    The adolescent's capacity to anticipate achievement
F39 0900  7    and to exercise the self-discipline necessary to complete
F39 0910  7    tasks successfully depends on the degree to which he
F39 0920  7    or she developed autonomy, initiative, and self-discipline
F39 0930  3    during childhood. The developmental process involves
F39 0940  1    the individual's progressively experiencing a sense
F39 0940  7    of dignity and achievement resulting from having completed
F39 0950  5    tasks, having kept commitments, and having created
F39 0960  4    something (however small or simple- even a doll dress
F39 0970  2    of one's own design rather than in the design "it ought
F39 0980  1    to be"). These childhood experiences are sources of
F39 0980  9    the self-certainty that the adolescent needs, for experimenting
F39 0990  7    with many roles, and for the freedom to fail sometimes
F39 1000  7    in the process of exploring and discovering her skills
F39 1010  4    and abilities.
F39 1010  6       If she has not had such experiences, the female's
F39 1020  4    normal adolescent degree of indecision will be compounded.
F39 1030  3    She may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted
F39 1040  1    with present and future alternatives- e&g&, whether
F39 1040  8    to prepare primarily for a career or for the role of
F39 1050 10    a homemaker; whether to stay financially dependent
F39 1060  5    on her parents or help support herself while attending
F39 1070  3    school; whether to pursue a college education or a
F39 1080  1    job after high school; and whether to attend this or
F39 1080 11    that college and to follow this or that course of study.
F39 1090  9    Erikson has noted that, as this indecision mounts,
F39 1100  4    it may result in a "paralysis of workmanship". This
F39 1110  2    paralysis may be expressed in the female's starting-
F39 1110 10    and never completing- many jobs, tasks, and courses
F39 1120  8    of study; and in the fact that she bases her decisions
F39 1130  8    about work, college, carreer, and studies on what others
F39 1140  5    are doing, rather than on her own sense of identity
F39 1150  1    with given skills, abilities, likes, and dislikes.
F39 1150  8    The absence, during her childhood and early adolescence,
F39 1170  7    of experiences in developing the self-discipline to
F39 1180  5    complete tasks within her ability- experiences that
F39 1190  2    would have been subsequent sources of anticipation
F39 1190  9    of achievement- and her lack of childhood opportunities
F39 1200  9    to practice autonomy and initiative in play and expression,
F39 1210  7    both tend in her adolescence to deprive her of the
F39 1220  6    freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally
F39 1230  1    in experimenting.
F39 1230  3       The comments made by some unwed mothers (quoted
F39 1240  2    in Chapter /2,) reflect this paralysis of workmanship.
F39 1240 10    They attended school and selected courses primarily
F39 1250  7    on the basis of decisions others made; they accepted
F39 1260  5    a job primarily because it was available, convenient,
F39 1270  2    and paid reasonably. These things both express and,
F39 1280  1    at the same time, continue contributing to, their identity
F39 1280 10    diffusion in an area that could have become a source
F39 1290 10    of developing dignity and self-certainty. As their
F39 1300  5    identity diffusion increased, they became more susceptible
F39 1310  2    to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs.
F39 1310 10    These affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of
F39 1320  7    school or work activities containing no anticipation
F39 1330  4    of achievement and joy of craftsmanship, no sense of
F39 1340  4    dignity derived from a job well done.
F39 1340 11       Childhood experiences in learning work and self-discipline
F39 1350  8    habits within a context of developing autonomy and
F39 1360  5    initiative have considerable significance for the prevention
F39 1370  4    of illegitimacy. The excerpts from case histories presented
F39 1380  2    above confirm this significance, though through different
F39 1390  1    facets of experience. For example, some unwed mothers
F39 1390  9    had had no work experiences, household chores, and
F39 1400  5    responsibilities during childhood and early adolescence;
F39 1410  4    they subsequently occupied their leisure hours in searching
F39 1420  3    for something exciting and diverting. Sex was both.
F39 1420 11    On the other hand, some unwed mothers had had so much
F39 1430 11    work and responsibility imposed on them at an early
F39 1440  7    age, and had thus had so little freedom or opportunity
F39 1450  3    to develop autonomy and initiative, that their work
F39 1460  1    and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens-
F39 1460  8    to be escaped and rebelled against through fun and
F39 1470  7    experimentation with forbidden sexual behavior.
F39 1480  3       The adolescent also faces the identity crisis that
F39 1490  3    Erikson has termed ideological polarization vs& diffusion
F39 1500  1    of ideals. In discussing the ways this crisis is germane
F39 1500 11    to consderations for the prevention of illegitimacy,
F39 1510  6    we shall again superimpose Erikson's concept on our
F39 1520  5    data.
F39 1520  6       Adolescents have a much-discussed tendency to polarize
F39 1530  4    ideas and values, to perceive things as "either-or",
F39 1540  3    black or white- nuances of meaning are relatively unimportant.
F39 1550  2    This tendency is, perhaps, most clearly revealed in
F39 1550 10    the literature on religious conversions and experiences
F39 1560  7    of adolescents. Erikson has postulated that such ideological
F39 1570  6    polarization temporarily resolves their search for
F39 1580  5    something stable and definite in the rapidly changing
F39 1590  2    and fluctuating no-man's-land between childhood and
F39 1590 10    adulthood. It provides identification- with an idea,
F39 1600  7    a value, a cause that cuts through, or even transcends,
F39 1610  6    the multiple and ambivalent identities of their passage
F39 1620  4    from child to adult, and permits their forceful and
F39 1630  2    overt expression of emotion.
F39 1630  6       The positive development, during adolescence, of
F39 1640  3    this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with
F39 1650  1    increasing independence, and to identify overtly either
F39 1650  8    with or against given ideas, values, and practices,
F39 1660  6    depends to a considerable degree on both previous and
F39 1670  5    present opportunities for developing autonomy, initiative,
F39 1680  2    and self-certainty. Most adolescents have some ideological
F39 1690  1    diffusion at various developmental stages, as they
F39 1690  8    experience a proliferation of ideas and values. The
F39 1700  6    diffusion is most pronounced and most likely to become
F39 1710  5    fixed, however, in those who have had no or very minimal
F39 1720  2    opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative
F39 1720  9    that could have been directed into constructive expression
F39 1730  7    and so served as sources of developing self-certainty.
F39 1740  5       A pronounced ideological diffusion- i&e&, inability
F39 1750  3    to identify independently with given ideas and value
F39 1760  4    systems- is reflected in many ways. For example, it
F39 1770  2    is evinced by the adolescent (or adult) whose beliefs
F39 1770 11    and actions represent primarily his rebellion and reaction
F39 1780  7    again the ideas and behavior patterns of others, rather
F39 1790  5    than his inner conviction and choice. It is mirrored
F39 1800  4    by the individual Willie Lohmans, whose ideas and behavior
F39 1810  2    patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they
F39 1810 10    always coincide with those of the individual or group
F39 1820  8    present and most important at the moment. In another
F39 1830  6    sense, it is represented in the arguments of the "true
F39 1840  4    believers" who seek to disprove the validity of all
F39 1850  1    other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence
F39 1850 10    in theirs.
F39 1860  1       The case histories provide some interesting illustrations
F39 1860  8    of ideological diffusion, embodied in the unwed mother's
F39 1870  7    inability to identify independently with a given value
F39 1880  6    system or behavior pattern, and her subsequent disinclination
F39 1890  4    to assume any individual responsibility for her sexual
F39 1900  4    behavior. For example, the unwed mothers expressed
F39 1910  1    their frustration with males who did not indicate more
F39 1910 10    explicitly "what it is they really want from a girl
F39 1920  9    so one can act accordingly". They were disappointed
F39 1930  4    by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital sexual
F39 1940  2    intercourse. They condemned the movie script writers
F39 1940  9    for implying that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating.
F39 1950  7    They criticized parents for never having emphasized
F39 1960  5    traditional concepts of right and wrong; and they censured
F39 1970  4    parents who "never disciplined and were too permissive"
F39 1980  1    or who "never explained how easy it was to get pregnant".
F39 1990  1       In the adult world, there are a number of rather
F39 1990 11    general and diffuse sources of ideological diffusion
F39 2000  6    that further compound the adolescent's search for meaning
F39 2010  5    during this particular identity crisis. For example,
F39 2020  3    some contemporary writing tends to fuse the "good guys"
F39 2030  2    and the "bad guys", to portray the weak people as heroes
F39 2030 13    and weakness as a virtue, and to explain (or even justify)
F39 2040 11    asocial behavior by attributing it to deterministic
F39 2050  6    psychological, familial, and social experiences.
F40 0010  1    In the final accounting, these would have augmented
F40 0010  9    the bill for both sides. An estimate of one million
F40 0020  7    dollars is probably not excessive.
F40 0030  1       Yet the huge amount of money consumed by the Selden
F40 0030 11    litigation, which many regarded as wasteful, indirectly
F40 0040  7    contributed to constructive changes in legal procedure.
F40 0050  5    The duration and other circumstances of the Selden
F40 0060  4    case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses
F40 0060 14    of patent infringement actions. The suit, as we have
F40 0070  9    seen, came before the courts when patent attorneys,
F40 0080  6    inventors, and laymen were making mounting demands
F40 0090  2    for reforms in the American patent system. Chief among
F40 0100  1    the defects they singled out were the complicated and
F40 0100 10    wearisome procedures in equity.
F40 0110  3       In a long and angry footnote to his opinion, Judge
F40 0120  2    Hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation
F40 0120 10    to such criticism. "It is a duty", said Hough, "not
F40 0130  8    to let pass this opportunity of protesting against
F40 0140  4    the methods of taking and printing testimony in Equity,
F40 0150  3    current in this circuit (and probably others), excused
F40 0160  1    if not justified by the rules of the Supreme Court,
F40 0160 11    especially to be found in patent causes, and flagrantly
F40 0170  8    exemplified in this litigation. As long as the bar
F40 0180  6    prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition, rather
F40 0190  2    than viva voce before an authoritative judicial officer,
F40 0200  1    I fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged,
F40 0200 10    and expensive prolixity remain the best known characteristic
F40 0210  7    of Equity". Observing that "reforms sometimes begin
F40 0220  5    with the contemplation of horrible examples", Hough
F40 0230  3    catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing procedures.
F40 0240  2    He cited the elephantine dimensions of the Selden case
F40 0250  1    record; the duplication of testimony and exhibits;
F40 0250  8    the numerous squabbles over minor matters; the "objections
F40 0260  7    stated at outrageous length"; and the frequent and
F40 0270  6    rancorous verbal bouts, "uncalled for and unjustifiable,
F40 0290  2    from the retort discourteous to the lie direct".
F40 0300  1       The fundamental difficulty of which the Selden case
F40 0300  9    was "a striking (though not singular) example", concluded
F40 0310  8    Hough, "will remain as long as testimony is taken without
F40 0320  9    any authoritative judicial officer present, and responsible
F40 0330  5    for the maintenance of discipline, and the reception
F40 0340  4    or exclusion of testimony".
F40 0340  8       Not least among the members of the patent bar who
F40 0350  9    echoed this powerful indictment were those who had
F40 0360  5    participated in the Selden suit. William A& Redding
F40 0370  2    asserted that if the case had been heard in open court
F40 0370 13    under rules of evidence, the testimony would have been
F40 0380  9    completed in sixty days instead of five years. Inventors
F40 0390  7    joined lawyers in the clamor for reform, inevitably
F40 0400  3    centering upon the Selden litigation as a "horrible
F40 0410  1    example". Its costive deliberations were likened to
F40 0410  8    those of the British courts of chancery mercilessly
F40 0420  7    caricatured by Dickens in Bleak House.
F40 0430  3       Parker, who agreed with much of this criticism,
F40 0440  1    did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural
F40 0440  8    defects. But he felt that the Selden case was being
F40 0450  9    unfairly pilloried. In a detailed letter published
F40 0460  3    in the Scientific American in 1912, he remarked that
F40 0470  3    "loose statements" about the case showed scant understanding
F40 0480  1    of the facts. The suit, although commonly designated
F40 0480  9    as a single action, actually embraced five cases. Parker
F40 0490  7    insisted that the size of the record would have been
F40 0500  7    drastically reduced but for an unavoidable duplication
F40 0510  2    of testimony.
F40 0510  4       In a private communication written in 1911, Parker
F40 0520  4    had been more to the point. Noting the complaints of
F40 0530  2    inventors and members of the patent bar, he admitted
F40 0530 11    that some of the strictures "were fairly well founded",
F40 0540  8    but he added that under existing rules the courts could
F40 0550  6    not consolidate testimony in a group of suits involving
F40 0560  4    separate infringements of the same patent. The vast
F40 0570  2    industrial interests caught up in the Selden suit,
F40 0570 10    as well as the complex character of the automotive
F40 0580  6    art, encouraged both sides to exploit "every possible
F40 0590  3    chance" for or against the patent, said Parker. "This
F40 0600  2    very seldom happens in this class or in other cases,
F40 0600 12    and of course all of these matters led to a volume
F40 0610 11    and an expense of the record beyond what ordinarily
F40 0620  5    would occur".
F40 0620  7       Parker listed the remedies he deemed essential for
F40 0630  6    reducing the cost and mass of testimony. The most important
F40 0640  4    of these found him in agreement with Hough's plea for
F40 0650  3    reform. Parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate
F40 0660  1    or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before
F40 0660  8    officers of the court who had no authority to limit
F40 0670  7    testimony. The taking of depositions, he suggested,
F40 0680  3    should be placed under a special court examiner empowered
F40 0690  1    to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude
F40 0690 10    immaterial testimony. "I am satisfied that in the Selden
F40 0700  9    case had this power existed and this course [been]
F40 0710  6    pursued, it would have shortened the depositions of
F40 0720  4    some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of
F40 0730  1    the other witnesses thereto more than that".
F40 0730  8       In the end Hough's acidulous protest, which Parker
F40 0740  5    called the "now somewhat famous note on this 'Selden'
F40 0750  5    case", did not go unheeded. In 1912 the United States
F40 0760  4    Supreme Court adopted a new set of rules of equity
F40 0770  1    which became effective on February 1, 1913. The revised
F40 0770 10    procedure was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform. Under
F40 0780  9    the new rules, testimony is taken orally in open court
F40 0790  7    in all cases except those of an extraordinary character.
F40 0800  2    Other expeditious methods are designed to prevent prolixity,
F40 0810  2    limit delays, and reduce the expense of infringement
F40 0810 10    suits. One of the A&L&A&M& lawyers observed that if
F40 0820  9    the Selden case had been tried under this simplified
F40 0830  8    procedure, the testimony which filled more than a score
F40 0840  7    of volumes, "at a minimum cost of $1 a page for publication
F40 0850  5    alone, could have been contained in one volume". While
F40 0860  2    patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive
F40 0870  1    forms of litigation, these rules have saved litigants
F40 0870  9    uncounted sums of money. There is little doubt that
F40 0880  8    they were promulgated by the Supreme Court as a direct
F40 0890  5    result of the Selden patent suit.
F40 0890 11    #3#
F40 0890 12    Even before it was formally dissolved in 1912, the
F40 0900  9    A&L&A&M& was succeeded by the Automobile Board of Trade,
F40 0910  9    the direct lineal ancestor of the present-day Automobile
F40 0920  7    Manufacturers Association. The trade bodies which came
F40 0930  6    in the wake of the A&L&A&M& were more representative,
F40 0940  4    for they never adopted a policy of exclusion. Nevertheless,
F40 0950  2    it is from the Selden organization that the industry
F40 0960  1    inherited its institutional machinery for furthering
F40 0960  7    the broader interests of the trade. One of the chief
F40 0970  8    features of this community of interest is the automotive
F40 0980  4    patents cross-licensing agreement, a milestone in the
F40 0990  3    development of American industrial cooperation. Its
F40 0990  9    origin lies in the Selden patent controversy and its
F40 1000  9    aftermath.
F40 1000 10       From the earliest days of the motor car industry,
F40 1010  9    before the A&L&A&M& was established, patent infringement
F40 1020  5    loomed as a serious and vexing problem. Many patent
F40 1030  5    contests were waged over automobile components and
F40 1040  2    accessories, among them tires, detachable rims, ball
F40 1040  9    bearings, license brackets, and electric horns. The
F40 1050  7    fluidity and momentum of the young industry abetted
F40 1060  5    a general disregard of patent claims. As early as 1900
F40 1070  4    a Wall Street combination acquired detail patents with
F40 1080  1    the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile
F40 1080  9    manufacturers. This scheme failed, and the following
F40 1090  7    decade brought a deluge of infringement suits among
F40 1100  3    individual manufacturers that reached its crest in
F40 1110  2    1912.
F40 1110  3       In this tangle of conflicting claims, the patent-sharing
F40 1120  1    scheme adopted by the A&L&A&M& at its founding proved
F40 1130  1    to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the
F40 1130 11    burdens of incessant litigation. The interchange of
F40 1140  5    shop licenses for a nominal royalty eliminated infringement
F40 1150  3    suits among the members of the A&L&A&M& patent pool
F40 1160  3    (although it did not protect them against outside actions)
F40 1170  2    and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization
F40 1170 10    of automotive technology. One of the conditions of
F40 1180  7    the pool was a prohibition upon the withholding of
F40 1190  5    patent rights among A&L&A&M& members. Within its limits,
F40 1200  4    this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics
F40 1210  1    of a cross-licensing agreement. Its positive features
F40 1220  1    outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of
F40 1220 11    a wouldbe monopoly. Since the A&L&A&M& holdings embraced
F40 1230  6    only about twenty-five per cent of motor vehicle patents,
F40 1240  7    the denial of rights to independent companies did not
F40 1250  4    retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors of
F40 1260  2    the industry. The highly important Dyer patents on
F40 1260 10    the sliding gear transmission were held by the A&L&A&M&
F40 1270  8    pool. But Henry Ford used the planetary transmission
F40 1280  6    in his Model ~T and earlier cars and, in 1905, as a
F40 1290  7    precautionary measure, took out a license from the
F40 1300  3    man who claimed to be its inventor.
F40 1300 10       For those affiliated with it, the A&L&A&M& pool
F40 1310  6    was a haven from the infringement actions involving
F40 1320  3    detail patents that beset the industry with mounting
F40 1330  1    intensity after 1900. By 1910 the courts were crowded
F40 1330 10    with cases, many of them brought by freebooters who
F40 1340  8    trafficked in disputed inventions. It was commonplace
F40 1350  4    for auto makers, parts-suppliers, and dealers to find
F40 1360  3    warning notices and threats of infringement suits in
F40 1360 11    their daily mail. "Purely from the business man's standpoint
F40 1370  9    and without regard to the lawyer's view", commented
F40 1380  7    a trade journal, "the matter of patents in the automobile
F40 1390  7    and accessory trade is developing some phases and results
F40 1400  5    that challenge thought as to how far patents are to
F40 1410  3    become weapons of warfare in business, instead of simple
F40 1410 12    beneficient protection devices for encouraging inventive
F40 1420  6    creation".
F40 1430  1       Occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the
F40 1430  8    almost certain prospect of legal complications. One
F40 1440  6    manufacturer who held an allegedly basic patent said:
F40 1450  4    "I would readily put over $50,000 into the manufacture
F40 1460  2    of the device, but it is so easy to make that we would
F40 1460 15    enter immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent
F40 1470  8    litigation which would eat up all our profits". The
F40 1480  7    prevailing view in the industry was summed up in 1912
F40 1490  5    by a group of auto makers who told a Senate committee:
F40 1500  1    "The exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive
F40 1500  7    conditions, including delays surrounding legal disputes,
F40 1510  6    particularly in patent litigation, are items of industrial
F40 1520  6    burden which must be written large in figures of many
F40 1530  6    millions of dollars of industrial waste".
F40 1540  1       By that time it was commonly agreed that patent
F40 1540 10    warfare was sapping constructive achievement and blocking
F40 1550  5    the free exchange of technical information. At this
F40 1560  4    point Charles C& Hanch, long an advocate of patent
F40 1570  3    peace in the industry, became chairman of the patents
F40 1570 12    committee of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce,
F40 1580  8    successor to the Automobile Board of Trade. Hanch was
F40 1590  9    treasurer of the Nordyke + Marmon Company, an Indianapolis
F40 1600  6    firm which had manufactured flour-milling machinery
F40 1610  2    before producing the Marmon car in 1904. He had first-hand
F40 1620  3    knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about
F40 1620 12    ninety per cent of the milling equipment makers out
F40 1630  9    of business in the mid-1890's. Anxious to avoid a similar
F40 1640  6    debacle in the motor car industry, Hanch went to Detroit
F40 1650  5    in 1909 to enlist the support of leading A&L&A&M& members
F40 1660  3    for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan. The breach
F40 1670  3    created by the Selden patent doomed his proposal, but
F40 1670 12    Hanch did not abandon his scheme.
F40 1680  6       After the demise of the A&L&A&M&, the time was propitious
F40 1690  5    for establishing such a pool. Most manufacturers were
F40 1700  4    now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal interchange
F40 1710  2    of patents. "It is a much easier course to agree to
F40 1720  1    let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are
F40 1720 11    concerned", said a trade authority, "than to continue
F40 1730  7    the costly effort of straightening the tangle in the
F40 1740  5    courts or seeking to reform the patent system, which
F40 1750  2    appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day".
F40 1760  1       With the other members of the patents committee-
F40 1760  9    Wilfred C& Leland, Howard E& Coffin, Windsor T& White,
F40 1770  7    and W& H& Vandervoort- Hanch drafted a cross-licensing
F40 1780  6    agreement whose essential feature of royalty-free licensing
F40 1790  6    was his own contribution. The plan was supported by
F40 1800  5    Frederick P& Fish, counsel for the National Automobile
F40 1810  2    Chamber of Commerce. It will be recalled that in his
F40 1820  1    summation for the A&L&A&M& before Judge Hough, Fish
F40 1820  9    had condemned patent litigation as the curse of the
F40 1830  9    American industrial community. He was well aware that
F40 1840  7    some inventors and their allies used their patents
F40 1850  3    solely for nuisance value. "My personal view is that
F40 1860  1    not one patented invention in ten is worth making",
F40 1860 10    he later told a Congressional committee. The eloquent
F40 1870  6    persuasions of Fish guaranteed the adoption of the
F40 1880  5    plan by the members of the automotive trade association.
F40 1890  1       Drawn up in 1914, the cross-licensing agreement
F40 1890  9    became effective in 1915. It remained in force for
F40 1900  9    ten years and has been renewed at five-year intervals
F40 1910  6    since 1925.
F41 0010  1    A little farther along the road you come to the Church
F41 0010 12    of Santa Sabina, called the "Pearl of the Aventine".
F41 0020  8    Continue another hundred yards to the Piazza of the
F41 0030  8    Knights of Malta. On the wall of this square there
F41 0040  6    are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments.
F41 0050  1    The massive gate of the Maltese villa affords one of
F41 0060  1    the most extraordinary views in Rome. If you look through
F41 0060 11    the keyhole, you will see an artistically landscaped
F41 0070  7    garden with the white dome of St& Peter's framed in
F41 0080  6    a long avenue of cropped laurel trees.
F41 0090  1       Retrace your steps a few yards on the Via di Santa
F41 0090 12    Sabina and turn right on the Via di S& Alessio, a street
F41 0100 11    lined with stately homes. Oleanders, cypress, and palms
F41 0110  7    in the spacious gardens add much color and beauty to
F41 0120  7    this attractive residential section. Turn left a block
F41 0130  4    or so before the street ends, and then turn right down
F41 0140  1    the Via di Santa Prisca to the Viale Aventino. Here
F41 0140 11    you can pick up a taxi or public transport to return
F41 0150 10    to the center of the city.
F41 0160  1    #THE RENAISSANCE CITY#
F41 0170  1    _TO THE PIAZZA NAVONA AND PANTHEON_
F41 0170  1       These two walks take you through the heart of Rome.
F41 0170 11    You will walk some of the narrow, old streets, hemmed
F41 0180  9    in by massive palazzi. You will visit a few churches
F41 0190  7    that are exceptional yet often by-passed, a magnificent
F41 0200  3    square, the main shopping district, the Spanish Steps,
F41 0210  2    and the lovely Pincian Gardens. By seeing such varied
F41 0210 11    places, both interesting and beautiful, you will become
F41 0220  8    aware of the many different civilizations Rome has
F41 0230  5    lived through, and in particular, get a feel of Renaissance
F41 0240  5    Rome. You will realize why Rome is indeed the Eternal
F41 0250  3    City.
F41 0250  4       Start on the Via d& Teatro di Marcello at the foot
F41 0260  4    of the Capitoline Hill. The majestic circular tiers
F41 0270  2    of stone of the Theatre of Marcellus give you some
F41 0270 12    idea of the huge edifice that the Emperor Augustus
F41 0280  9    erected in 13 B&C&. Twenty-two thousand spectators
F41 0290  5    used to crowd it in Roman days. Andrea Palladio, an
F41 0300  4    Italian architect of the sixteenth century, modeled
F41 0310  1    his designs on its Doric and Ionic columns.
F41 0310  9       Wander past the three superb Columns of Apollo by
F41 0320  8    the arches of the theatre. The remains of the Portico
F41 0330  6    of Octavia are now in front of you. Climb the steps
F41 0340  5    from the theatre to the Via della Tribuna di Campitelli
F41 0350  2    for an even better view of the Columns of Apollo.
F41 0360  1       Turn to the right along a narrow street to the tiny
F41 0360 11    Piazza Campitelli, then proceed along the Via dei Funari
F41 0370  8    to the Piazza Mattei. Here is one of the loveliest
F41 0380  6    fountains in Rome, the Fontana delle Tartarughe or
F41 0390  3    "Fountain of the Tortoises". It's typical of Rome that
F41 0400  4    in the midst of this rather poor area you should find
F41 0410  1    such an artistic work in the center of a little square.
F41 0410 12    Stand here for a few moments and look at this gem of
F41 0420 11    a fountain with its four youths, each holding a tortoise
F41 0430  5    and each with a foot resting on the head of a dolphin.
F41 0440  4    The figures have been executed so skillfully that one
F41 0450  1    senses a great feeling of life and movement.
F41 0450  9       Opposite is the Palazzo Mattei, one of Rome's oldest
F41 0460  7    palaces, now the headquarters of the Italo-American
F41 0470  5    Association. Go inside for a closer look at a Renaissance
F41 0480  5    palace. In the first courtyard there are some fine
F41 0490  3    bas-reliefs and friezes, and in the second a series
F41 0490 13    of delightful terraced roof gardens above an ivy-covered
F41 0500  8    wall. The Palazzo Caetani, still inhabited by the Caetani
F41 0510  7    family, adjoins the Palazzo Mattei.
F41 0520  2       Keep straight ahead on the Via Falegnami, cross
F41 0530  1    the wide Via Arenula, and you will come to the Piazza
F41 0530 12    B& Cairoli, where you should look in at the Church
F41 0540 10    of San Carlo ai Catinari to see the frescoes on the
F41 0550  9    ceiling. Follow the colorful and busy Via d& Giubbonari
F41 0560  6    for a hundred yards or so. Now turn left at the Via
F41 0570  5    dell' Arco del Monte to the Piazza dei Pellegrini.
F41 0580  1    Just a few yards to the right on the Via Capo di Ferro
F41 0580 14    will bring you to the Palazzo Spada, built in 1540
F41 0590 10    and now occupied by the Council of State. Paintings
F41 0600  7    by Titian, Caravaggio, and Rubens are on display (open
F41 0610  7    9:30-4:00).
F41 0610  9       Before you enter the palazzo, note Francesco Borromini's
F41 0620  6    facade. The great architect also designed the fine
F41 0630  5    interior staircase and colonnade which connects the
F41 0640  3    two courts. The large statue on the first floor is
F41 0640 13    believed to be the statue of Pompey at the base of
F41 0650 11    which Julius Caesar was stabbed to death (if so, the
F41 0660  8    statue once stood in the senate house). (This is shown
F41 0670  5    in the afternoon and on Sunday morning.)
F41 0680  1       By tipping the porter, you can see in the courtyard
F41 0680 11    Borromini's unusual and fascinating trick in perspective.
F41 0690  7    When you stand before the barrel-vaulted colonnade
F41 0700  5    you have the impression that the statue at the end
F41 0710  3    is at a considerable distance, yet it is actually only
F41 0710 13    a few feet away. The sense of perspective has been
F41 0720  9    created by designing the length of the columns so that
F41 0730  7    those at the far end of the colonnade are much shorter
F41 0740  4    than those in front. The gardens of the palazzo, shaded
F41 0750  2    by a huge magnolia tree, are most attractive. The courtyard
F41 0760  1    is magnificently decorated.
F41 0760  4       From the Palazzo Spada you continue another block
F41 0770  3    along the Via Capo di Ferro and Vicolo de Venti to
F41 0780  2    the imposing Palazzo Farnese, begun in 1514 and considered
F41 0790  1    by many to be the finest palace of all. Michelangelo
F41 0790 11    was the most distinguished of several noted architects
F41 0800  5    who helped design it. Today it is occupied by the French
F41 0810  6    Embassy. Its lovely seventeenth-century ceiling frescoes,
F41 0820  3    as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously
F41 0830  1    high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling, can be
F41 0830  9    seen Sundays (11:00-12:00 noon). Ask to see the modern
F41 0840  9    tapestries of Paris and Rome designed by Lurcat.
F41 0850  6       Directly in front of the palace along the Via d&
F41 0860  5    Baullari you will come to the Campo di Fiori, the famous
F41 0870  3    site of executions during the turbulent days of Renaissance
F41 0880  1    Rome. Today, by contrast it is a lively and colorful
F41 0880 11    fruit, vegetable, and flower market. Continue on the
F41 0890  8    Via d& Baullari to the Corso Vittorio Emanuele, then
F41 0900  6    turn right for a couple of hundred yards to the Church
F41 0910  5    of Sant' Andrea della Valle. As you approach the church
F41 0920  4    on the Via d& Baullari you are passing within yards
F41 0930  2    of the remains of the Roman Theatre of Pompey, near
F41 0930 12    which is believed to have been the place where Julius
F41 0940 10    Caesar was assassinated. The dome of the church is,
F41 0950  7    outside of St& Peter's, one of the largest in Rome.
F41 0960  7    Opera lovers will be interested to learn that this
F41 0970  3    church was the scene for the first act of Tosca.
F41 0980  1       At this point you cross the wide Corso Vittorio
F41 0980 10    Emanuele /2,, walk along the Corso del Rinascimento
F41 0990  7    a couple of hundred yards, then turn left on the Via
F41 1000  7    dei Canestrani to enter the splendid Piazza Navona,
F41 1010  2    one of the truly glorious sights in Rome.
F41 1010 10       Your first impression of this elongated square with
F41 1020  8    its three elegant fountains, its two churches that
F41 1030  5    almost face each other, and its russet-colored buildings,
F41 1040  2    is a sense of restful spaciousness- particularly welcome
F41 1050  2    after wandering around the narrow and dark streets
F41 1050 10    that you have followed since starting this walk.
F41 1060  6       The site of the oblong piazza is Domitian's ancient
F41 1070  5    stadium, which was probably used for horse and chariot
F41 1080  5    races. For centuries it was the location of historic
F41 1090  1    festivals and open-air sports events. From the seventeenth
F41 1090 10    to the nineteenth century it was a popular practice
F41 1100  9    to flood the piazza in the summer, and the aristocrats
F41 1110  6    would then ride around the inundated square in their
F41 1120  4    carriages.
F41 1120  5       Giovanni Bernini's "Fountain of the Rivers", in
F41 1130  5    the center of the piazza, is built around a Roman obelisk
F41 1140  4    from the Circus of Maxentius which rests on grottoes
F41 1150  1    and rocks, with four huge figures, one at each corner,
F41 1150 11    denoting four great rivers from different continents-
F41 1160  6    the Danube, the Ganges, the Nile, and the Plate. The
F41 1170  6    eyes of the figure of the Nile are covered, perhaps
F41 1180  2    either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to
F41 1180 12    obscure from her sight the baroque facade of the Church
F41 1190 10    of Sant' Agnese in Agone, the work of Bernini's rival,
F41 1200  8    Borromini.
F41 1210  1       In the Piazza Navona there are many delightful cafes
F41 1210  9    where you can sit, have a drink or lunch, and watch
F41 1220  9    the fountains in the square. The scene before you is
F41 1230  5    indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about
F41 1240  1    Rome. Perhaps a street musician will pass to add that
F41 1240 11    extra touch.
F41 1250  1       Take the Via di S& Agnese in Agone, next to the
F41 1250 12    church and opposite the center of the square, then
F41 1260  9    turn right after about two hundred yards to reach the
F41 1270  7    beautiful Church of Santa Maria della Pace. Inside
F41 1280  3    you will find the lovely Sibyls painted by Raphael
F41 1290  1    and a chapel designed by Michelangelo. The church's
F41 1290  9    cloisters are among Donato Bramante's most beautiful
F41 1300  7    creations.
F41 1300  8       Now return to the Piazza Navona and leave it on
F41 1310 10    the opposite side by the Corsia Agonale; in a moment
F41 1320  6    cross the Corso del Rinascimento. In front of you is
F41 1330  6    the Palazzo Madama, once belonging to the Medici and
F41 1340  3    now the Italian Senate. Walk by the side of the palazzo
F41 1350  2    and after two blocks along the Via Giustiniani you
F41 1350 11    will come to the Piazza della Rotonda. You are now
F41 1360  9    facing the Pantheon, the largest and best-preserved
F41 1370  6    building still standing from the days of ancient Rome.
F41 1380  5       This circular edifice, constructed by Agrippa in
F41 1390  3    B&C& 27, was rebuilt in its present shape by the Emperor
F41 1400  1    Hadrian. It was dedicated as a church in the seventh
F41 1400 11    century. As you pause in the piazza by the Egyptian
F41 1410 10    obelisk brought from the Temple of Isis, you will admire
F41 1420  7    the Pantheon's impressive Corinthian columns.
F41 1430  2       The Pantheon's interior, still in its original form,
F41 1440  2    is truly majestic and an architectural triumph. Its
F41 1440 10    rotunda forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal
F41 1450  9    to the height from the floor to the ceiling. The only
F41 1460  8    means of interior light is the twenty-nine-foot-wide
F41 1470  5    aperture in the stupendous dome. Standing before the
F41 1480  3    tomb of Raphael, the great genius of the Renaissance,
F41 1480 12    when shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great
F41 1490  8    Roman temple, you are once again reminded of the varied
F41 1500  7    civilizations so characteristic of Rome.
F41 1510  2       As you leave the Pantheon, take the narrow street
F41 1510 11    to the right, the Via del Seminario, a block to Sant'
F41 1520 11    Ignazio, one of the most splendid baroque churches
F41 1530  8    in the city. (Along the way there, about one hundred
F41 1540  5    yards on your right, you pass a simple restaurant,
F41 1550  1    La Sacrestia, where you can have the best pizza in
F41 1550 11    Rome.) The curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses
F41 1560  9    in front of the church seems like a stage set. This
F41 1570  7    is one of the most charming little squares in this
F41 1580  4    part of Rome. One block along the Via de Burro (in
F41 1590  1    front of the church) will bring you to the Stock Exchange
F41 1590 12    in the old Temple of Neptune. A few yards farther,
F41 1600 10    on the Via dei Bergamaschi, is the Piazza Colonna.
F41 1610  7    The great column from which the square takes its name
F41 1620  7    was erected by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius.
F41 1630  2       You are now at the Corso, though narrow, one of
F41 1640  2    Rome's busiest streets. Horse races took place here
F41 1640 10    in the Middle Ages.
F41 1650  2       If you have taken this stroll in the morning, and
F41 1650 12    you have the time and inclination, walk to the right
F41 1660  9    along the crowded Corso for half a dozen blocks to
F41 1670  7    visit the fine private collection of paintings- mainly
F41 1680  4    of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries- in the
F41 1690  1    Palazzo Doria (open Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday,
F41 1690  8    10:00-1:00). Here is your opportunity to see the inside
F41 1700  9    of a palazzo where the family still lives.
F41 1710  5       Otherwise, cross over the Corso and walk a block
F41 1720  4    or so to the left. You will come to Alemagna, a delightful,
F41 1730  2    though moderately expensive restaurant, which is particularly
F41 1740  1    noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and
F41 1740 10    patisseries. Either here, or in one of the modest restaurants
F41 1750 10    nearby, is just the place to end this first walk through
F41 1760  8    the heart of Rome.
F41 1770  1    _TO THE SPANISH STEPS_
F41 1770  2       The second walk through the heart of Rome should
F41 1770 11    be taken after lunch, so that you will reach the Pincian
F41 1780 10    Hill when the soft light of the late afternoon is at
F41 1790 10    its best.
F42 0010  1    Rare, indeed, is the Harlem citizen, from the most
F42 0010 10    circumspect church member to the most shiftless adolescent,
F42 0020  7    who does not have a long tale to tell of police incompetence,
F42 0030  6    injustice, or brutality. I myself have witnessed and
F42 0040  4    endured it more than once. The businessmen and racketeers
F42 0050  1    also have a story. And so do the prostitutes. (And
F42 0050 11    this is not, perhaps, the place to discuss Harlem's
F42 0060  7    very complex attitude toward black policemen, nor the
F42 0070  5    reasons, according to Harlem, that they are nearly
F42 0080  3    all downtown.)
F42 0080  5       It is hard, on the other hand, to blame the policeman,
F42 0090  3    blank, good-natured, thoughtless, and insuperably innocent,
F42 0100  2    for being such a perfect representative of the people
F42 0100 11    he serves. He, too, believes in good intentions and
F42 0110  8    is astounded and offended when they are not taken for
F42 0120  7    the deed. He has never, himself, done anything for
F42 0130  3    which to be hated- which of us has?- and yet he is
F42 0140  1    facing, daily and nightly, people who would gladly
F42 0140  9    see him dead, and he knows it. There is no way for
F42 0150  8    him not to know it: there are few things under heaven
F42 0160  3    more unnerving than the silent, accumulating contempt
F42 0170  1    and hatred of a people. He moves through Harlem, therefore,
F42 0170 11    like an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country;
F42 0180  9    which is precisely what, and where, he is, and is the
F42 0190  9    reason he walks in twos and threes. And he is not the
F42 0200  6    only one who knows why he is always in company: the
F42 0210  2    people who are watching him know why, too. Any street
F42 0210 12    meeting, sacred or secular, which he and his colleagues
F42 0220  9    uneasily cover has as its explicit or implicit burden
F42 0230  6    the cruelty and injustice of the white domination.
F42 0240  2    And these days, of course, in terms increasingly vivid
F42 0240 11    and jubilant, it speaks of the end of that domination.
F42 0250 10    The white policeman standing on a Harlem street corner
F42 0260  7    finds himself at the very center of the revolution
F42 0270  4    now occurring in the world. He is not prepared for
F42 0280  2    it- naturally, nobody is- and, what is possibly much
F42 0280 11    more to the point, he is exposed, as few white people
F42 0290  9    are, to the anguish of the black people around him.
F42 0300  5    Even if he is gifted with the merest mustard grain
F42 0310  2    of imagination, something must seep in. He cannot avoid
F42 0310 11    observing that some of the children, in spite of their
F42 0320 10    color, remind him of children he has known and loved,
F42 0330  7    perhaps even of his own children. He knows that he
F42 0340  4    certainly does not want his children living this way.
F42 0350  2    He can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction:
F42 0350 12    into a callousness which very shortly becomes second
F42 0360  8    nature. He becomes more callous, the population becomes
F42 0370  5    more hostile, the situation grows more tense, and the
F42 0380  5    police force is increased. One day, to everyone's astonishment,
F42 0390  2    someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything
F42 0400  1    blows up. Before the dust has settled or the blood
F42 0400 11    congealed, editorials, speeches, and civil-rights commissions
F42 0410  6    are loud in the land, demanding to know what happened.
F42 0420  5    What happened is that Negroes want to be treated like
F42 0430  4    men.
F42 0430  5       Negroes want to be treated like men: a perfectly
F42 0440  3    straightforward statement, containing only seven words.
F42 0450  1    People who have mastered Kant, Hegel, Shakespeare,
F42 0450  8    Marx, Freud, and the Bible find this statement utterly
F42 0460  8    impenetrable. The idea seems to threaten profound,
F42 0470  4    barely conscious assumptions. A kind of panic paralyzes
F42 0480  2    their features, as though they found themselves trapped
F42 0480 10    on the edge of a steep place. I once tried to describe
F42 0490 12    to a very well-known American intellectual the conditions
F42 0500  5    among Negroes in the South. My recital disturbed him
F42 0510  5    and made him indignant; and he asked me in perfect
F42 0520  3    innocence, "Why don't all the Negroes in the South
F42 0530  1    move North"? I tried to explain what has happened,
F42 0530 10    unfailingly, whenever a significant body of Negroes
F42 0540  7    move North. They do not escape Jim Crow: they merely
F42 0550  6    encounter another, not-less-deadly variety. They do
F42 0560  4    not move to Chicago, they move to the South Side; they
F42 0570  2    do not move to New York, they move to Harlem. The pressure
F42 0580  1    within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand,
F42 0580 10    and this expansion is always violent. White people
F42 0590  6    hold the line as long as they can, and in as many ways
F42 0600  6    as they can, from verbal intimidation to physical violence.
F42 0610  2    But inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto
F42 0610 11    from the rest of the world falls into the hands of
F42 0620 11    the ghetto. The white people fall back bitterly before
F42 0630  6    the black horde; the landlords make a tidy profit by
F42 0640  5    raising the rent, chopping up the rooms, and all but
F42 0650  1    dispensing with the upkeep; and what has once been
F42 0650 10    a neighborhood turns into a "turf". This is precisely
F42 0660  8    what happened when the Puerto Ricans arrived in their
F42 0670  5    thousands- and the bitterness thus caused is, as I
F42 0680  4    write, being fought out all up and down those streets.
F42 0680 14       Northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury.
F42 0690  8    They seem to feel that because they fought on the right
F42 0700 10    side during the Civil War, and won, they have earned
F42 0710  7    the right merely to deplore what is going on in the
F42 0720  4    South, without taking any responsibility for it; and
F42 0730  1    that they can ignore what is happening in Northern
F42 0730 10    cities because what is happening in Little Rock or
F42 0740  7    Birmingham is worse. Well, in the first place, it is
F42 0750  5    not possible for anyone who has not endured both to
F42 0760  2    know which is "worse". I know Negroes who prefer the
F42 0760 12    South and white Southerners, because "At least there,
F42 0770  7    you haven't got to play any guessing games"! The guessing
F42 0780  7    games referred to have driven more than one Negro into
F42 0790  6    the narcotics ward, the madhouse, or the river. I know
F42 0800  4    another Negro, a man very dear to me, who says, with
F42 0810  1    conviction and with truth, "The spirit of the South
F42 0810 10    is the spirit of America". He was born in the North
F42 0820  9    and did his military training in the South. He did
F42 0830  6    not, as far as I can gather, find the South "worse";
F42 0840  2    he found it, if anything, all too familiar. In the
F42 0850  1    second place, though, even if Birmingham is worse,
F42 0850  9    no doubt Johannesburg, South Africa, beats it by several
F42 0860  8    miles, and Buchenwald was one of the worst things that
F42 0870  8    ever happened in the entire history of the world. The
F42 0880  5    world has never lacked for horrifying examples; but
F42 0890  2    I do not believe that these examples are meant to be
F42 0890 13    used as justification for our own crimes. This perpetual
F42 0900  7    justification empties the heart of all human feeling.
F42 0910  7    The emptier our hearts become, the greater will be
F42 0920  3    our crimes. Thirdly, the South is not merely an embarrassingly
F42 0930  1    backward region, but a part of this country, and what
F42 0930 11    happens there concerns every one of us.
F42 0940  7       As far as the color problem is concerned, there
F42 0950  4    is but one great difference between the Southern white
F42 0960  2    and the Northerner: the Southerner remembers, historically
F42 0960  9    and in his own psyche, a kind of Eden in which he loved
F42 0970 13    black people and they loved him. Historically, the
F42 0980  6    flaming sword laid across this Eden is the Civil War.
F42 0990  5    Personally, it is the Southerner's sexual coming of
F42 1000  3    age, when, without any warning, unbreakable taboos
F42 1000 10    are set up between himself and his past. Everything,
F42 1010  8    thereafter, is permitted him except the love he remembers
F42 1020  7    and has never ceased to need. The resulting, indescribable
F42 1030  2    torment affects every Southern mind and is the basis
F42 1040  2    of the Southern hysteria.
F42 1040  6       None of this is true for the Northerner. Negroes
F42 1050  3    represent nothing to him personally, except, perhaps,
F42 1060  1    the dangers of carnality. He never sees Negroes. Southerners
F42 1070  1    see them all the time. Northerners never think about
F42 1070 10    them whereas Southerners are never really thinking
F42 1080  5    of anything else. Negroes are, therefore, ignored in
F42 1090  4    the North and are under surveillance in the South,
F42 1100  1    and suffer hideously in both places. Neither the Southerner
F42 1100 10    nor the Northerner is able to look on the Negro simply
F42 1110 11    as a man. It seems to be indispensable to the national
F42 1120  7    self-esteem that the Negro be considered either as
F42 1130  4    a kind of ward (in which case we are told how many
F42 1140  1    Negroes, comparatively, bought Cadillacs last year
F42 1140  7    and how few, comparatively, were lynched), or as a
F42 1160  6    victim (in which case we are promised that he will
F42 1170  4    never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our
F42 1180  1    kids). They are two sides of the same coin and the
F42 1180 12    South will not change- cannot change- until the North
F42 1190  8    changes. The country will not change until it re-examines
F42 1200  7    itself and discovers what it really means by freedom.
F42 1210  4    In the meantime, generations keep being born, bitterness
F42 1220  1    is increased by incompetence, pride, and folly, and
F42 1220  9    the world shrinks around us.
F42 1230  3       It is a terrible, an inexorable, law that one cannot
F42 1240  2    deny the humanity of another without diminishing one's
F42 1240 10    own: in the face of one's victim, one sees oneself.
F42 1250 10    Walk through the streets of Harlem and see what we,
F42 1260  8    this nation, have become.
F42 1260 12    #4. EAST RIVER, DOWNTOWN: POSTSCRIPT TO A LETTER FROM
F42 1270  8    HARLEM#
F42 1280  1       THE FACT THAT AMERICAN NEgroes rioted in the U&N&
F42 1280  9    while Adlai Stevenson was addressing the Assembly shocked
F42 1290  7    and baffled most white Americans. Stevenson's speech,
F42 1300  4    and the spectacular disturbance in the gallery, were
F42 1310  5    both touched off by the death, in Katanga, the day
F42 1320  2    before, of Patrice Lumumba. Stevenson stated, in the
F42 1320 10    course of his address, that the United States was "against"
F42 1330  9    colonialism. God knows what the African nations, who
F42 1340  7    hold 25 per cent of the voting stock in the U&N& were
F42 1350  6    thinking- they may, for example, have been thinking
F42 1360  3    of the U&S& abstention when the vote on Algerian freedom
F42 1370  2    was before the Assembly- but I think I have a fairly
F42 1370 13    accurate notion of what the Negroes in the gallery
F42 1380  9    were thinking. I had intended to be there myself. It
F42 1390  7    was my first reaction upon hearing of Lumumba's death.
F42 1400  4    I was curious about the impact of this political assassination
F42 1410  2    on Negroes in Harlem, for Lumumba had- has- captured
F42 1420  1    the popular imagination there. I was curious to know
F42 1420 10    if Lumumba's death, which is surely among the most
F42 1430  8    sinister of recent events, would elicit from "our"
F42 1440  5    side anything more than the usual, well-meaning rhetoric.
F42 1450  2    And I was curious about the African reaction.
F42 1460  1       However, the chaos on my desk prevented my being
F42 1460 10    in the U&N& gallery. Had I been there, I, too, in the
F42 1470 10    eyes of most Americans, would have been merely a pawn
F42 1480  7    in the hands of the Communists. The climate and the
F42 1490  4    events of the last decade, and the steady pressure
F42 1490 13    of the "cold" war, have given Americans yet another
F42 1500  9    means of avoiding self-examination, and so it has been
F42 1510  8    decided that the riots were "Communist" inspired. Nor
F42 1520  3    was it long, naturally, before prominent Negroes rushed
F42 1530  3    forward to assure the republic that the U&N& rioters
F42 1540  1    do not represent the real feeling of the Negro community.
F42 1550  1       According, then, to what I take to be the prevailing
F42 1550 10    view, these rioters were merely a handful of irresponsible,
F42 1560  7    Stalinist-corrupted provocateurs.
F42 1570  1       I find this view amazing. It is a view which even
F42 1580  1    a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict.
F42 1580  9    One has only, for example, to walk through Harlem and
F42 1590 10    ask oneself two questions. The first question is: Would
F42 1600  6    I like to live here? And the second question is: Why
F42 1610  7    don't those who now live here move out? The answer
F42 1620  4    to both questions is immediately obvious. Unless one
F42 1630  2    takes refuge in the theory- however disguised- that
F42 1630 10    Negroes are, somehow, different from white people,
F42 1640  7    I do not see how one can escape the conclusion that
F42 1650  5    the Negro's status in this country is not only a cruel
F42 1660  5    injustice but a grave national liability.
F42 1660 11       Now, I do not doubt that, among the people at the
F42 1670 11    U&N& that day, there were Stalinist and professional
F42 1680  5    revolutionists acting out of the most cynical motives.
F42 1690  4    Wherever there is great social discontent, these people
F42 1700  2    are, sooner or later, to be found. Their presence is
F42 1700 12    not as frightening as the discontent which creates
F42 1710  7    their opportunity. What I find appalling- and really
F42 1720  6    dangerous- is the American assumption that the Negro
F42 1730  4    is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical
F42 1740  1    agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest.
F42 1740 11    It is a notion which contains a gratuitous insult,
F42 1750  6    implying, as it does, that Negroes can make no move
F42 1760  5    unless they are manipulated.
F43 0010  1    Color was delayed until 1935, the wide screen until
F43 0010 10    the early fifties.
F43 0020  1       Movement itself was the chief and often the only
F43 0020 10    attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties.
F43 0030  8    Each film consisted of fifty feet, which gives a running
F43 0040  6    time of about one minute on the screen. As long as
F43 0050  4    audiences came to see the movement, there seemed little
F43 0050 13    reason to adventure further. Motion-picture exhibitions
F43 0060  7    took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that
F43 0070  7    of the penny arcade which can still be found in such
F43 0080  6    urban areas as Times Square. Brief snips of actual
F43 0090  2    events were shown: parades, dances, street scenes.
F43 0090  9    The sensational and frightening enjoyed popularity:
F43 0100  5    a train rushes straight at the audience, or a great
F43 0110  6    wave threatens to break over the seats. An early Edison
F43 0120  3    production was The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots.
F43 0130  1    The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold; the headsman
F43 0130  9    swung his axe; the head dropped off; end of film. An
F43 0140 11    early film by a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo Park
F43 0150  9    simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of
F43 0160  6    the contemporary stage.
F43 0160  9       In the field of entertainment there is no spur to
F43 0170  8    financial daring so effective as audience boredom,
F43 0180  4    and the first decade of the new device was not over
F43 0190  1    before audiences began staying away in large numbers
F43 0190  9    from the simple-minded, one-minute shows. In response,
F43 0200  6    the industry allowed the discovery of the motion picture
F43 0210  5    as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential
F43 0220  3    form they have had to this day. Despite the sheer beauty
F43 0230  2    and spectacle of numerous documentaries, art films,
F43 0230  9    and travelogues, despite the impressive financial success
F43 0240  6    of such a recent development as Cinerama, the movies
F43 0250  5    are at heart a form of fiction, like the play, the
F43 0260  3    novel, or the short story. Moreover, the most artistically
F43 0270  1    successful of the nonfiction films have invariably
F43 0270  8    borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature.
F43 0280  6    Thus such great American documentaries as The River
F43 0290  4    and The Plow That Broke the Plains were composed as
F43 0300  4    visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures.
F43 0310  1    The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was
F43 0310 11    made in the early years of this century and it was
F43 0320  8    made chiefly by two men, a French magician, Georges
F43 0330  3    Melies, and an American employee of Edison, Edwin S&
F43 0340  2    Porter. Of the two, Porter is justly the better known,
F43 0340 12    for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction
F43 0350 10    for films to take the first step toward fashioning
F43 0360  5    a language of film, toward making the motion picture
F43 0370  2    the intricate, efficient time machine that it has remained
F43 0380  1    since, even in the most inept hands.
F43 0380  8    #NARRATIVE TIME AND FILM TIME#
F43 0390  1    Melies, however, out of his professional instincts
F43 0390  8    as a magician, discovered and made use of a number
F43 0400  8    of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary
F43 0410  5    of film. One of these is the "dissolve", which makes
F43 0420  3    possible a visually smooth transition from scene to
F43 0420 11    scene. As the first scene begins to fade, the succeeding
F43 0430 10    scene begins to appear. For a moment or two, both scenes
F43 0440 10    are present simultaneously, one growing weaker, one
F43 0450  5    growing stronger. In a series of fairy tales and fantasies,
F43 0460  3    Melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped
F43 0470  1    to tell a straightforward story, with beginning, middle
F43 0470  9    and end, complications, resolutions, climaxes, and
F43 0480  4    conclusions. Immediately, the film improved and it
F43 0490  5    improved because in narrative it found a content based
F43 0500  2    on time to complement its own unbreakable connection
F43 0500 10    with time. Physically, a movie is possible because
F43 0510  7    a series of images is projected one at a time at such
F43 0520  7    a speed that the eye "remembers" the one that has gone
F43 0530  4    before even as it registers the one now appearing.
F43 0530 13    Linking the smoothly changing images together, the
F43 0540  7    eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement.
F43 0550  6    The "projection" time of painting and sculpture is
F43 0560  4    highly subjective, varying from person to person and
F43 0570  1    even varying for a given person on different occasions.
F43 0570 10    So is the time of the novel. The drama in the theater
F43 0580  9    and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time,
F43 0590  6    but the time is fixed by the director and the players,
F43 0600  2    the conductor and the instrumentalists, subject, therefore,
F43 0610  1    to much variation, as record collectors well know.
F43 0610  9    The time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely.
F43 0620  5    The film consists of a series of still, transparent
F43 0630  2    photographs, or "frames", 35-mm&-wide. Each frame comes
F43 0640  2    between the light and the lens and is individually
F43 0640 11    projected on the screen, at the rate, for silent movies,
F43 0650 10    of 16 frames per second, and, for sound films, 24 frames
F43 0660  7    per second. This is the rate of projection; it is also
F43 0670  4    the rate of photographing. Time is built into the motion
F43 0680  3    picture, which cannot exist without time. Now time
F43 0680 11    is also the concern of the fictional narrative, which
F43 0690  8    is, at its simplest, the story of an action with, usually,
F43 0700  8    a beginning, a middle, and an end- elements which demand
F43 0710  6    time as the first condition for their existence. The
F43 0720  2    "moving" picture of the train or the wave coming at
F43 0720 12    the audience is, to be sure, more intense than a still
F43 0730 11    picture of the same subject, but the difference is
F43 0740  6    really one of degree; the cinematic element of time
F43 0750  4    is merely used to increase the realism of an object
F43 0750 14    which would still be reasonably realistic in a still
F43 0760  9    photo. In narrative, time is essential, as it is in
F43 0770  8    film. Almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly
F43 0780  5    of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained
F43 0790  3    between narrative time and film time. This discovery
F43 0800  1    of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes
F43 0800 10    dazzling, magician's tricks produced on film.
F43 0810  6       It was Porter, however, who produced the very first
F43 0820  6    movie whose name has lived on through the half century
F43 0830  3    of film history that has since ensued. The movie was
F43 0830 13    The Great Train Robbery and its effects on the young
F43 0840 10    industry and art were all but incalculable. Overnight,
F43 0850  7    for one thing, Porter's film multiplied the standard
F43 0860  5    running time of movies by ten. The Great Train Robbery
F43 0870  4    is a one-reel film. One reel- from eight to twelve
F43 0880  2    minutes- became the standard length from the year of
F43 0880 11    Robbery, 1903, until Griffith shattered that limit
F43 0890  7    forever with Birth of a Nation in 1915. The reel itself
F43 0900  8    became and still is the standard of measure for the
F43 0910  5    movies.
F43 0910  6       The material of the Porter film is simplicity itself;
F43 0920  4    much of it has continued to be used over the years
F43 0930  2    and the heart of it- good guys and bad guys in the
F43 0930 14    old West- pretty well dominated television toward the
F43 0940  9    end of the 1950's. A band of robbers enters a railroad
F43 0950  7    station, overpowers and ties up the telegraph operator,
F43 0960  3    holds up the train and escapes. A posse is formed and
F43 0970  2    pursues the robbers, who, having made their escape,
F43 0970 10    are whooping it up with some wild, wild women in a
F43 0980 10    honky-tonk hide-out. The robbers run from the hide-out,
F43 0990  6    take cover in a wooded declivity, and are shot dead
F43 1000  2    by the posse. As a finale is appended a close-up of
F43 1000 14    one of the band taking aim and firing his revolver
F43 1010  8    straight at the audience.
F43 1020  1       All this is simple enough, but in telling the story
F43 1020 11    Porter did two important things that had not been done
F43 1030  9    before. Each scene is shot straight through, as had
F43 1040  5    been the universal custom, from a camera fixed in a
F43 1050  3    single position, but in the outdoor scenes, especially
F43 1050 11    in the capture and destruction of the outlaws, Porter's
F43 1060  8    camera position breaks, necessarily, with the camera
F43 1070  6    position standard until then, which had been, roughly,
F43 1080  4    that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a
F43 1090  2    play. The plane of the action in the scene is not parallel
F43 1090 14    with the plane of the film in the camera or on the
F43 1100 11    screen. If the change, at first sight, seems minor,
F43 1110  5    we may recall that it took the Italian painters about
F43 1120  2    two hundred years to make an analogous change, and
F43 1120 11    the Italian painters, by universal consent, were the
F43 1130  7    most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen.
F43 1140  6    In that apparently simple shift Porter opened the way
F43 1150  4    to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument
F43 1150 14    of art as well as a mechanical recording device.
F43 1160  9       He did more than that. He revealed the potential
F43 1170  6    value of the "cut" as the basic technique in the art
F43 1180  5    of the film. Cutting, of course, takes place automatically
F43 1190  1    in the creation of a film. The meaning of the word
F43 1190 12    is quite physical, to begin with. The physical film
F43 1200  8    is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence,
F43 1210  6    and the cut edge is joined physically, by cement, to
F43 1220  4    the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence.
F43 1220 14    If, as a home movie maker, you shoot the inevitable
F43 1230 10    footage of your child taking its first steps, you have
F43 1240  7    merely recorded an historical event. If, in preparing
F43 1250  4    that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends,
F43 1260  1    you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames
F43 1260 11    of the child's grandmother watching this event, you
F43 1270  6    have begun to be an artist in film; you are employing
F43 1280  5    the basic technique of film; you are cutting.
F43 1290  1       This is what Porter did. As the robbers leave the
F43 1290 11    looted train, the film suddenly cuts back to the station,
F43 1300 10    where the telegrapher's little daughter arrives with
F43 1310  5    her father's dinner pail only to find him bound on
F43 1320  6    the floor. She dashes around in alarm. The two events
F43 1330  2    are taking place at the same time. Time and space have
F43 1330 13    both become cinematic. We leap from event to event-
F43 1340  8    including the formation of the posse- even though the
F43 1350  7    events, in "reality" are taking place not in sequence
F43 1360  5    but simultaneously, and not near each other but at
F43 1370  2    a considerable distance.
F43 1370  5       The "chase" as a standard film device probably dates
F43 1380  4    from The Great Train Robbery, and there is a reason
F43 1390  4    for the continued popularity of the device. The chase
F43 1390 13    in itself is a narrative; it presumes both speed and
F43 1400 10    urgency and it demands cutting- both from pursued to
F43 1410  5    pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both.
F43 1420  6    The simple, naked idea of one man chasing another is
F43 1430  2    of its nature better fitted for the film than it is
F43 1430 13    for any other form of fiction. The cowboy films, the
F43 1440  8    cops and robbers films, and the slapstick comedy films
F43 1450  5    culminating in an insane chase are not only catering
F43 1460  3    to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for
F43 1460 14    violence; these films and these sequences are also
F43 1470  8    seeking out- instinctively or by design- the peculiarly
F43 1480  6    cinematic elements of narrative.
F43 1490  1    #THE CREATOR OF THE ART OF THE FILM: D&W&GRIFFITH#
F43 1490 10    There still remained the need for one great film artist
F43 1500 10    to explore the full potential of the new form and to
F43 1510  8    make it an art. The man was D&W& Griffith. When he
F43 1520  4    came to the movies- more or less by accident- they
F43 1530  4    were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling
F43 1530 11    the unthinking for an idle few minutes. In about seven
F43 1540  9    years Griffith either invented or first realized the
F43 1550  6    possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal
F43 1560  4    of the film maker. Before he was forty Griffith had
F43 1570  2    created the art of the film.
F43 1570  8       Not that there had not been attempts, mostly European,
F43 1580  4    to do exactly that. But in general the European efforts
F43 1590  2    to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the
F43 1590 12    slowly emerging language of the film itself. Staggeringly
F43 1600  8    condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays
F43 1610  7    were presented. Great actors and actresses- the most
F43 1620  5    notable being Sarah Bernhardt- were hired to repeat
F43 1630  3    their stage performances before the camera. In all
F43 1630 11    of this extensive and expensive effort, the camera
F43 1640  7    was downgraded to the status of recording instrument
F43 1650  4    for art work produced elsewhere by the actor or by
F43 1660  3    the author. The phonograph today, for all its high
F43 1660 12    fidelity and stereophonic sound, is precisely what
F43 1670  7    the early art purveyors in the movies wished to make
F43 1680  6    of the camera. Not surprisingly, this approach did
F43 1690  2    not work. The effort produced a valuable record of
F43 1690 11    stage techniques in the early years of the century
F43 1700  8    and some interesting records of great theater figures
F43 1710  5    who would otherwise be only names. But no art at all
F43 1720  3    was born of the art effort in the early movies.
F44 0010  1    In general, religious interest seems to exist in all
F44 0010 10    parts of the metropolis; congregational membership,
F44 0020  3    however, is another thing. A congregation survives
F44 0030  2    only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership;
F44 0040  1    that is, when it can preserve economic integration.
F44 0040  9    Religious faith can be considered a necessary condition
F44 0050  8    of membership in a congregation, since the decision
F44 0060  6    to join a worshiping group requires some motive force,
F44 0070  4    but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining;
F44 0080  1    the presence of other members of similar social and
F44 0080 10    economic level is the sufficient condition.
F44 0090  6       The breakdown of social homogeneity in inner city
F44 0100  5    areas and the spread of inner city blight account for
F44 0110  2    the decline of central city churches. Central cities
F44 0110 10    reveal two adverse features for the major denominations:
F44 0120  8    (1) central cities tend to be areas of residence for
F44 0130  8    lower social classes; (2) central cities tend to be
F44 0140  5    more heterogeneous in social composition. The central
F44 0150  1    city areas, in other words, exhibit the two characteristics
F44 0150 10    which violate the life principle of congregations of
F44 0160  8    the major denominations: they have too few middle-class
F44 0170  7    people; they mix middle-class people with lower-class
F44 0180  4    residents. Central city areas have become progressively
F44 0190  1    poorer locales for the major denominations since the
F44 0190  9    exodus of middle-class people from most central cities.
F44 0200  9    With few exceptions, the major denominations are rapidly
F44 0210  6    losing their hold on the central city.
F44 0220  2       The key to Protestant development, therefore, is
F44 0220  9    economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation.
F44 0230  8    Members of higher and lower social status often cluster
F44 0240  7    around this nucleus, so that Protestant figures on
F44 0250  3    social class give the impression of spread over all
F44 0260  1    social classes; but this is deceptive, for the core
F44 0260 10    of membership is concentrated in a single social and
F44 0270  7    economic stratum. The congregation perishes when it
F44 0280  4    is no longer possible to replenish that core from the
F44 0290  1    neighborhood; moreover, residential mobility is so
F44 0290  7    high in metropolitan areas that churches have to recruit
F44 0300  7    constantly in their core stratum in order to survive;
F44 0310  5    they can lose higher- and lower-status members from
F44 0320  2    the church without collapsing, but they need adequate
F44 0320 10    recruits for the core stratum in order to preserve
F44 0330  9    economic integration. The congregation is first and
F44 0340  5    foremost an economic peer group; it is secondarily
F44 0350  2    a believing and worshiping fellowship. If it were primarily
F44 0360  1    a believing fellowship, it would recruit believers
F44 0360  8    from all social and economic ranks, something which
F44 0370  6    most congregations of the New Protestantism (with a
F44 0380  3    few notable exceptions) have not been able to do. They
F44 0390  2    survive only when they can recruit social and economic
F44 0390 11    peers.
F44 0400  1       The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to
F44 0400  7    social differences has often been attributed to the
F44 0410  7    "folksy spirit" of Protestant religious life; in fact,
F44 0420  5    a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the "impersonal"
F44 0430  4    Roman Catholic parish. We have seen that the folksy
F44 0440  3    spirit is confined to economic peers; consequently,
F44 0440 10    the vulnerability to social difference should not be
F44 0450  8    attributed to the stress on personal community in Protestant
F44 0460  6    congregations; actually, there is little evidence of
F44 0470  5    such personal community in Protestant congregations,
F44 0480  1    as we shall see in another connection. The vulnerability
F44 0480 10    of Protestantism to social differences stems from the
F44 0490  8    peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class
F44 0500  8    life, where the congregation is a vehicle of social
F44 0510  5    and economic group identity and must conform, therefore,
F44 0520  1    to the principle of economic integration. This fact
F44 0520  9    is evident in the recruitment of new members.
F44 0530  7    #MISSION AS CO-OPTATION#
F44 0530 11    The rule of economic integration in congregational
F44 0540  7    life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the
F44 0550  5    major denominations. There is much talk in theological
F44 0560  3    circles about the "Church as Mission" and the "Church's
F44 0570  1    Mission"; theologians have been stressing the fact
F44 0570  8    that the Church does not exist for its own sake but
F44 0580 11    as a testimony in the world for the healing of the
F44 0590  8    world. A crucial question, therefore, is what evangelism
F44 0600  4    and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism.
F44 0610  1    If economic integration really shapes congregational
F44 0610  7    life, then evangelism should be a process of extending
F44 0620  8    economic integration. The task of a congregation would
F44 0630  7    be defined, according to economic integration, as the
F44 0640  3    work of co-opting individuals and families of similar
F44 0650  1    social and economic position to replenish the nuclear
F44 0650  9    core of the congregation. (Co-optation means to choose
F44 0660  6    by joint action in order to fill a vacancy; it can
F44 0670  6    also mean the assimilation of centers of power from
F44 0680  2    an environment in order to strengthen an organization.)
F44 0680 10    In a mobile society, congregational health depends
F44 0690  6    on a constant process of recruitment; this recruitment,
F44 0700  4    however, must follow the pattern of economic integration
F44 0710  3    or it will disrupt the congregation; therefore, the
F44 0720  2    recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation
F44 0720  9    will be co-optation rather than proclamation- like
F44 0730  5    elements will have to be assimilated.
F44 0740  1       Evangelism and congregational outreach have not
F44 0740  7    been carefully studied in the churches; one study in
F44 0750  9    Pittsburgh, however, has illuminated the situation.
F44 0760  5    In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh churches,
F44 0770  2    almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial "contacts
F44 0780  1    with friendly members". If we add to these contacts
F44 0780 10    with friendly members the "contacts with an organization
F44 0790  7    of the church" (11.2 per cent of the cases), then a
F44 0800  8    substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through
F44 0810  3    friendly contact. On the surface, this seems a sound
F44 0820  1    approach to Christian mission: members of the congregation
F44 0820  9    show by their friendly attitudes that they care for
F44 0830  8    new people; the new people respond in kind by joining
F44 0840  6    the church.
F44 0840  8       Missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat
F44 0850  6    different when one reflects on what is known about
F44 0860  4    friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods; the
F44 0860 10    majority of such contacts are with people of similar
F44 0870  9    social and economic position; association by level
F44 0880  5    of achievement is the dominant principle of informal
F44 0890  3    relations. This means that the antennae of the congregation
F44 0900  1    are extended into the community, picking up the wave
F44 0900 10    lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic
F44 0910 11    level of the congregation; the mission of the church
F44 0920  6    is actually a process of informal co-optation; the
F44 0930  4    lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people
F44 0940  1    who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the
F44 0940 10    congregation. Churches can be strengthened through
F44 0950  6    this process of co-optation so long as the environs
F44 0960  4    of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who
F44 0970  2    can fit the pattern of economic integration; once the
F44 0970 11    pool of recruits diminishes, the congregation is helpless-
F44 0980  6    friendly contacts no longer keep it going.
F44 0990  5       The transmutation of mission to co-optation is further
F44 1000  3    indicated by the insignificance of educational activities,
F44 1010  1    worship, preaching, and publicity in reaching new members.
F44 1010  9    The proclamation of the churches is almost totally
F44 1020  8    confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy (17.3 per
F44 1030  6    cent of new members) and friendly contacts by members
F44 1040  3    (over two thirds if organizational activities are included).
F44 1050  1    Publicity accounted for 1.1 per cent of the initial
F44 1050 10    contacts with new members. In general, friendly contact
F44 1060  7    with a member followed by contact with a clergyman
F44 1070  5    will account for a major share of recruitment by the
F44 1080  3    churches, making it quite evident that the extension
F44 1080 11    of economic integration through co-optation is the
F44 1090  7    principal form of mission in the contemporary church;
F44 1100  5    economic integration and co-optation are the two methods
F44 1110  4    by which Protestants associate with and recruit from
F44 1120  1    the neighborhood. The inner life of congregations will
F44 1120  9    prosper so long as like-minded people of similar social
F44 1130  8    and economic level can fraternize together; the outer
F44 1140  4    life of congregations- the suitability of the environment
F44 1150  4    to their survival- will be propitious so long as the
F44 1160  2    people in the area are of the same social and economic
F44 1160 13    level as the membership. Economic integration ceases
F44 1170  5    when the social and economic statuses in an area become
F44 1180  6    too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation.
F44 1190  3    In a rapidly changing society congregations will run
F44 1200  1    into difficulties repeatedly, since such nice balances
F44 1200  8    of economic integration are hard to sustain in the
F44 1210  7    metropolis for more than a single generation. The fact
F44 1220  4    that metropolitan churches of the major denominations
F44 1230  1    have moved approximately every generation for the last
F44 1230  9    hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in
F44 1240  7    the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance.
F44 1250  5    The expense of this type of organization in religious
F44 1260  3    life, when one recalls the number of city churches
F44 1260 12    which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned,
F44 1270  7    raises fundamental questions about the principle of
F44 1280  6    Protestant survival in a mobile society; nonetheless,
F44 1290  3    the prevalence of economic integration in congregations
F44 1300  1    illumines the nature of the Protestant development.
F44 1310  1       It was observed in the introductory chapter that
F44 1310  9    metropolitan life had split into two trends- expanding
F44 1320  6    interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing
F44 1330  4    exclusiveness in local communal groupings. These trends
F44 1340  1    seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis.
F44 1340 11    Residential associations struggle to insulate themselves
F44 1350  6    against intrusions. The motifs of impersonal interdependence
F44 1360  6    and insulation of residential communities have polarized;
F44 1370  4    the schism between central city and suburb, Negro and
F44 1380  3    White, blue collar and white collar can be viewed as
F44 1390  1    symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in
F44 1390  9    the metropolis. It now becomes evident that the denominational
F44 1400  8    church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class
F44 1410  7    culture, for it serves to crystallize the social class
F44 1420  4    identity of middle-class residential groupings. The
F44 1430  2    accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated
F44 1430  9    the drive to conformity in congregations of the major
F44 1440  9    denominations. This conformity represents a desperate
F44 1450  5    attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment.
F44 1460  2    More than creatures of metropolitan forces, the churches
F44 1470  2    have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence
F44 1470 10    of metropolitan life, crystallizing and perpetuating
F44 1480  5    the stratification of peoples, giving form to the struggle
F44 1490  7    for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous
F44 1500  3    peoples.
F44 1500  4       Since American life is committed above all to productivity
F44 1510  5    and a higher standard of economic life, the countervailing
F44 1520  2    forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have
F44 1530  1    fought a desperate, rearguard action against the expanding
F44 1530  9    interdependence of the metropolis. Consumer communities
F44 1540  6    have suffered at the hands of the productive interests.
F44 1550  5    Negroes, Puerto Ricans, and rural newcomers are slowly
F44 1560  4    making their way into the cities. Soon they will fight
F44 1570  2    their way into the lower middle-class suburbs, and
F44 1570 11    the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding
F44 1580  8    cycle which has characterized their history for a century.
F44 1590  6    The identification of the basic unit of religious organization-
F44 1600  4    the parish or congregation- with a residential area
F44 1610  3    is self-defeating in a modern metropolis, for it simply
F44 1620  1    means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of
F44 1620 12    the Christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission
F44 1630  7    to co-optation. Mission to the metropolis contradicts
F44 1640  5    survival of the congregation in the residential community,
F44 1650  2    because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan
F44 1660  1    interdependence with residential exclusion.
F44 1660  5       This interpretation of the role of residence in
F44 1670  7    the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various
F44 1680  4    projections for the churches. It could be argued that
F44 1690  2    any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods
F44 1690  9    is doomed to become an expression of the panic for
F44 1700  9    stable identity among the middle classes. It could
F44 1710  5    be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain
F44 1720  1    religious activity, since worship presupposes some
F44 1720  7    local stabilities. Whatever projection one makes, the
F44 1730  6    striking fact about congregational and parochial life
F44 1740  4    is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social
F44 1750  2    identity of middle-class people.
F44 1750  7       Attention will be given in the next chapter to the
F44 1760  7    style of association in the denominational churches;
F44 1770  2    this style is characteristically an expression of the
F44 1780  1    communal style of the middle classes. The keynotes
F44 1780  9    of this style are activism and emphasis on achievements
F44 1790  6    in gaining self-esteem. These values give direction
F44 1800  4    to the life of the middle-class man or woman, dictating
F44 1810  1    the methods of child rearing, determining the pattern
F44 1810  9    of community participation, setting the style for the
F44 1820  7    psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness, and
F44 1830  5    informing the congregational life of the major denominations.
F44 1840  2    "Fellowship by likeness" and "mission by friendly contact"
F44 1850  2    form the iron cage of denominational religion. Its
F44 1850 10    contents are another matter, for they reveal the kinds
F44 1860  9    of interests pursued by the congregation. What goes
F44 1870  6    on in the cage will occupy our attention under the
F44 1880  3    rubric of the organization church. An understanding
F44 1890  1    of the new role of residential association in an industrial
F44 1890 11    society serves to illuminate the forces which have
F44 1900  8    fashioned the iron cage of conformity which imprisons
F44 1910  4    the churches in their suburban captivity.
F44 1920  1       The perplexing question still remains as to why
F44 1920  9    the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle
F44 1930  8    of social identity when their clubs and charities should
F44 1940  4    fill the same need.
F45 0010  1    With capital largely squandered, there seemed to them
F45 0010  9    no other course to pursue.
F45 0020  3       The directors sold directly to concessionaires,
F45 0020  9    who had to make their profits above the high prices
F45 0030 10    asked by the company. These concessionaires traded
F45 0040  4    where they wished and generally dealt with the Indians
F45 0050  4    through engages, who might be habitants, voyageurs,
F45 0060  1    or even soldiers. The concessionaires also had to pay
F45 0060 10    a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded, and all
F45 0070 10    pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped
F45 0080  5    to France in company ships. The company disposed of
F45 0090  3    the pelts, but with what profit, the records do not
F45 0090 13    show.
F45 0100  1       In accord with its penurious policy, the company
F45 0100  9    failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the
F45 0110  8    principal Indians. The lavish use of presents had been
F45 0120  6    effective in expanding the Indian trade of New France
F45 0130  4    and Louisiana in the previous century, and the change
F45 0140  1    in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the
F45 0140 10    red men. Traders from the English colonies were far
F45 0150  7    more generous, and Indian loyalty turned to them. Protests
F45 0160  5    from governors and intendants passed unheeded, and
F45 0170  2    the parsimonious policy of the company probably let
F45 0170 10    loose Indian insurrections that brought ruin to the
F45 0180  7    company.
F45 0180  8       In 1721 the King sent three commissioners to Louisiana
F45 0190  8    with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect
F45 0200  7    the colony. They ordered the raising of troops and
F45 0210  4    obtained 75,000 livres with which to build forts. They
F45 0220  1    adopted a program by which Louisiana was divided into
F45 0220 10    five districts. In each of these there was to be a
F45 0230 10    strong military post, and a trading depot to supply
F45 0240  4    the smaller trading houses. For southeastern Louisiana,
F45 0250  1    Mobile was the principal post, and it was to furnish
F45 0250 11    supplies for trade to the north and east, in the region
F45 0260 11    threatened by British traders. Mobile was to be the
F45 0270  7    anchor of a chain of posts extending northward to the
F45 0280  4    sources of the Tennessee River. Fort Toulouse, on the
F45 0290  3    Alabama River, had been erected in 1714 for trade with
F45 0290 13    the Alabamas and Choctaws, but money was available
F45 0300  7    for only one other new post, near the present Nashville,
F45 0310  6    Tennessee, and this was soon abandoned.
F45 0320  1       West of the Mobile district was the lower Mississippi
F45 0330  1    district, of which New Orleans was headquarters. Dependent
F45 0330  9    upon it were posts on the lower Mississippi and the
F45 0340  9    region westward to the frontiers of New Spain.
F45 0350  4       On the middle Mississippi a principal post was to
F45 0360  4    be located near the mouth of the Arkansas. It was hoped
F45 0370  1    that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs
F45 0370 12    from the west, principally down the Arkansas River.
F45 0380  6    On the Ohio or Wabash was to be built another post
F45 0390  5    "at the fork of two great rivers". Other posts would
F45 0400  3    be established up the Ohio and Wabash to protect communication
F45 0410  1    with Canada. On the upper Mississippi the Illinois
F45 0410  9    post was to be established near Kaskaskia, and dependent
F45 0420  8    posts were to be built on the Missouri, "where there
F45 0430  6    are mines in abundance".
F45 0440  1       Each of the five principal posts was to have a director,
F45 0440 12    responsible to a director-general at New Orleans. An
F45 0450  9    elaborate system of accounting and reports was worked
F45 0460  5    out, and the trade was to be managed in the most scientific
F45 0470  3    way. Concessionaires were to be under the supervision
F45 0480  1    of the directors. Engages must be loyal to the concessionaires,
F45 0490  1    and must serve until the term provided in the engagement
F45 0490 11    was ended. The habitants were to be encouraged to trade
F45 0500  9    and were to dispose of their pelts to the concessionaires.
F45 0510  7       Only two principal storehouses were actually established-
F45 0520  4    one at Mobile, the other at New Orleans. New Orleans
F45 0530  4    supplied the goods for the trade on the Mississippi,
F45 0540  1    and west of that river, and on the Ohio and Wabash.
F45 0540 12    Mobile was also supplied by New Orleans with goods
F45 0550  9    for the Mobile district.
F45 0560  1       The power that Bienville exercised during his first
F45 0560  9    administration cannot be determined. Regulations for
F45 0570  6    the Indian trade were made by the Conseil superieure
F45 0580  6    de la Louisiane, and Bienville apparently did not have
F45 0590  5    control of that body. The Conseil even treated the
F45 0600  3    serious matter of British aggression as its business
F45 0600 11    and, on its own authority, sent to disaffected savages
F45 0610  9    merchandise "suitable for the peltry trade". It decided,
F45 0620  7    also, that the purely secular efforts of Bienville
F45 0630  4    were insufficient, and sent missionaries to win the
F45 0640  3    savages from the heathen Carolinians.
F45 0640  8       During the first administration of Bienville, the
F45 0650  5    peltry trade of the Mobile district was a lucrative
F45 0660  4    source of revenue. The Alabamas brought in annually
F45 0670  1    15,000 to 20,000 deerskins, and the Choctaws and Chickasaws
F45 0670 10    brought the total up to 50,000 pelts. These deerskins
F45 0680  9    were the raw material for the manufacture of leather,
F45 0690  6    and were the only articles which the tribes of this
F45 0700  4    district had to exchange for European goods.
F45 0710  1       During his first administration, Bienville succeeded
F45 0710  6    in keeping Carolina traders out of the Alabama country
F45 0720  7    and the Choctaw country. The director of the post at
F45 0730  6    Mobile kept an adequate amount of French goods, of
F45 0740  3    a kind to which they were accustomed, to supply the
F45 0740 13    Indian needs. The Alabama and Tombigbee rivers furnished
F45 0750  8    a highway by which goods could be moved quickly and
F45 0760  7    cheaply. De la Laude, commander of the Alabama post,
F45 0770  5    had the friendship of the natives, and was able to
F45 0780  2    make them look upon the British as poor competitors.
F45 0780 11    Diron d'Artaguette, the most prominent trader in the
F45 0790  7    district, was energetic and resourceful, but his methods
F45 0800  5    often aroused the ire of the French governors. He became,
F45 0810  3    after a time, commander of a post on the Alabama River,
F45 0820  2    but his operations extended from Mobile throughout
F45 0820  9    the district, and he finally obtained a monopoly of
F45 0830  8    the Indian trade.
F45 0840  1       The Chickasaws were the principal source of trouble
F45 0840  8    in the Mobile district. Their territory lay to the
F45 0850  6    north, near the sources of the Alabama, the Tombigbee,
F45 0860  3    the Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers, and was easily
F45 0870  2    accessible to traders among the near-by Cherokees.
F45 0870 10    In 1720 some Chickasaws massacred the French traders
F45 0880  6    among them, and did not make peace for four years.
F45 0890  6    Venturesome traders, however, continued to come to
F45 0900  3    them from Mobile, and to obtain a considerable number
F45 0900 12    of pelts for the French markets. British traders from
F45 0910  8    South Carolina incited the Indians against the French,
F45 0920  6    and there developed French and British Factions in
F45 0930  4    the tribe. The Chickasaws finally were the occasion
F45 0940  1    for the most disastrous wars during the French control
F45 0940 10    of Louisiana. To hold them was an essential part of
F45 0950  9    French policy, for they controlled the upper termini
F45 0960  5    of the routes from the north to Mobile. They threatened
F45 0970  3    constantly to give the British a hold on this region,
F45 0980  1    from whence they could move easily down the rivers
F45 0980 10    to the French settlements near the Gulf.
F45 0990  5       Bienville realized that if the French were to hold
F45 1000  4    the southeastern tribes against the enticements of
F45 1000 11    British goods, French traders must be able to offer
F45 1010  9    a supply as abundant as the Carolinians and at reasonable
F45 1020  7    prices. His urgings brought some results. The Company
F45 1030  5    of the Indies promised to send over a supply of Indian
F45 1040  3    trading goods, and to price them more cheaply in terms
F45 1050  1    of deerskins. But it coupled with this a requirement
F45 1050 10    that Indians must bring their pelts to Mobile and thus
F45 1060  9    save all costs of transportation into and out of the
F45 1070  6    Indian country.
F45 1070  8       The insistence of Bienville upon giving liberal
F45 1080  4    prices to the Indians, in order to drive back the Carolina
F45 1090  4    traders, was probably a factor that led to his recall
F45 1100  1    in 1724. For two years his friend and cousin, Boisbriant,
F45 1100 11    remained as acting governor and could do little to
F45 1110  9    stem the Anglican advance. Although he incited a few
F45 1120  6    friendly Indians to pillage the invaders, and even
F45 1130  3    kill some of them, the Carolina advance continued.
F45 1140  1       The company was impressed with some ideas of the
F45 1140 10    danger from Carolina, and when Perier came over as
F45 1150  7    governor in 1727, he was given special instructions
F45 1160  2    regarding the trade of the Mobile district. But the
F45 1170  1    Company of the Indies, holding to its program of economy,
F45 1170 11    made no arrangements to furnish better goods at attractive
F45 1180  7    prices. To the directors the problem appeared a matter
F45 1190  6    of intrigue or diplomacy. Perier attempted to understand
F45 1200  4    the problem by sending agents to inquire among the
F45 1210  2    Indians. These agents were to ascertain the difference
F45 1210 10    between English and French goods, and the prices charged
F45 1220  9    the Indians. They were to conciliate the unfriendly
F45 1230  6    savages, and, wherever possible, to incite the natives
F45 1240  4    to pillage the traders from Carolina. They were to
F45 1250  2    promise fine presents to the loyal red men, as well
F45 1250 12    as an abundant supply of trading goods at better prices
F45 1260  8    than the opposition was offering. Perier's intrigues
F45 1270  3    gained some successes. The savages divided into two
F45 1280  3    factions; one was British and the other, French. So
F45 1280 12    hostile did these factions become that, among the Choctaws,
F45 1290  9    civil war broke out.
F45 1300  2       Perier's efforts, however, were on the whole ineffective
F45 1310  1    in winning back the tribes of the Mobile district,
F45 1310 10    and he decided to send troops into the troubled country.
F45 1320  8    He asked the government for two hundred soldiers, who
F45 1330  6    were to be specifically assigned to arrest English
F45 1340  2    traders and disloyal Indians. In spite of the company's
F45 1350  1    restrictions, he planned to build new posts in the
F45 1350 10    territory. He asked also for more supplies to trade
F45 1360  7    at a low price for the Indians' pelts.
F45 1370  2       No help came from the crown, and Perier, in desperation,
F45 1390  1    gave a monopoly of the Indian trade in the district
F45 1390 11    to D'Artaguette. D'Artaguette went vigorously to work,
F45 1400  6    and gave credit to many hunters. But they brought back
F45 1410  6    few pelts to pay their debts, and soon French trade
F45 1420  3    in the region was at an end. Perier finally, in one
F45 1430  1    last bid in 1730, cut the price of goods to an advance
F45 1430 13    of 40 per cent above the cost in France. The Indians
F45 1440  8    were not impressed and held to the Carolina traders,
F45 1450  5    who swarmed over the country, almost to the Mississippi.
F45 1460  2       With the loss of the Mobile trade, which ended all
F45 1470  2    profits from Louisiana, the Natchez Indians revolted.
F45 1470  9    They destroyed a trading house and pillaged the goods,
F45 1480  8    and harassed French shipping on the Mississippi. The
F45 1490  5    war to subdue them taxed the resources of the colony
F45 1500  4    and piled up enormous debts. In January, 1731, the
F45 1500 13    company asked the crown to relieve it of the government
F45 1510 10    of the colony. It stated that it had lost 20,000,000
F45 1520  8    livres in its operations, and apparently blamed its
F45 1530  3    poor success largely on the Indian trade. It offered
F45 1540  1    to surrender its right to exclusive trade, but asked
F45 1540 10    an indemnity. The King accepted the surrender and fixed
F45 1550  8    the compensation of the company at 1,450,000 livres.
F45 1560  5    Thenceforth, the commerce of Louisiana was free to
F45 1570  4    all Frenchmen.
F45 1570  6       Company rule in Louisiana left the colony without
F45 1580  3    fortifications, arms, munitions, or supplies. The difficulties
F45 1590  1    of trade had ruined many voyageurs, and numbers of
F45 1590 10    them had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood
F45 1600 12    families. Others left the country, and there was no
F45 1610  8    one familiar with the Indian trade. If this trade should
F45 1620  5    be resumed, the habitants who had come to be farmers
F45 1630  4    or artisans, and soldiers discharged from the army,
F45 1630 12    must be hardened to the severe life of coureurs de
F45 1640 10    bois. This was a slow and difficult course, and French
F45 1650  7    trade suffered from the many mistakes of the new group
F45 1660  5    of traders. These men were without capital or experience.
F45 1670  2       Perier and Salmon, the intendant, wished either
F45 1680  1    to entrust the trade to an association of merchants
F45 1680 10    or to have the crown furnish goods on credit to individuals
F45 1690  7    who would repay their debts with pelts. Bienville,
F45 1700  4    who returned to succeed Perier in 1732, objected that
F45 1710  2    the merchants would not accept the responsibility of
F45 1710 10    managing a trade in which they could see no hope of
F45 1720 11    profits. He reported, too, that among the habitants
F45 1730  5    there were none of probity and ability sufficient to
F45 1740  3    justify entrusting them with the King's goods. He did
F45 1750  1    find some to trust, however, and he employed the King's
F45 1750 11    soldiers to trade. With no company to interfere, he
F45 1760  9    kept close control over all the traders.
F45 1770  3       In order to compete with English traders, Bienville
F45 1780  1    radically changed the price schedule. The King should
F45 1780  9    expect no profit, and an advance of only 20 per cent
F45 1790 11    above the cost in France, which would cover the expense
F45 1800  6    of transportation and handling, was all he charged
F45 1810  3    the traders.
F46 0010  1    They would not be pleased to have it published back
F46 0010 11    home that they planned a frolic in Paris or Hong Kong
F46 0020  8    at the Treasury's expense. They would be particularly
F46 0030  5    displeased with the State Department if it were the
F46 0040  4    source of such reports. Few things are more perilous
F46 0040 13    for the State Department than a displeased congressman.
F46 0050  8       The reason for this bears explaining for those who
F46 0060  8    may wonder why State spends so much of its diplomatic
F46 0070  6    energy on Congress when the Russians are so available.
F46 0080  3    First, the State Department is unique among government
F46 0090  1    agencies for its lack of public supporters. The farmers
F46 0090 10    may be aroused if Congress cuts into the Agriculture
F46 0100  7    Department's budget. Businessmen will rise if Congress
F46 0110  5    attacks the Commerce Department. Labor restrains undue
F46 0120  4    brutality toward the Labor Department; the Chamber
F46 0130  2    of Commerce, assaults upon the Treasury. A kaleidoscope
F46 0130 10    of pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman
F46 0140  9    who becomes ugly toward the Department of Health, Education,
F46 0150  7    and Welfare. The congressman's patriotism is always
F46 0160  4    involved when he turns upon the Defense Department.
F46 0170  2    Tampering with the Post Office may infuriate every
F46 0180  1    voter who can write.
F46 0180  5       With all these agencies, the congressman must constantly
F46 0190  3    check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly.
F46 0200  1    No such political restraint subdues his blood when
F46 0200  9    he gazes upon the State Department in anger.
F46 0210  6       In many sections he may even reap applause from
F46 0220  4    press and public for giving it a good lesson. After
F46 0230  1    all, the money dispensed by State goes not to the farmer,
F46 0230 12    the laborer, or the businessman, but to foreigners.
F46 0240  7    Not only do these foreigners not vote for American
F46 0250  5    congressmen; they are also probably ungrateful for
F46 0260  3    Uncle's Sam's bounty. And are not the State Department
F46 0270  1    men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and
F46 0270  9    do-gooders who have never met a payroll? Will not the
F46 0280 10    righteous congressman be cheered at the polls if he
F46 0290  8    reminds them to get right with America and if he saves
F46 0300  5    the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their
F46 0300 15    schemes? The chances are excellent that he will.
F46 0310  8       The result is that the State Department's perpetual
F46 0320  6    position before Congress is the resigned pose of the
F46 0330  6    whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever the
F46 0340  2    master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife. People
F46 0340 12    in this position do not offend the master by relating
F46 0350  9    his peccadilloes to the newspapers. State keeps the
F46 0360  5    junketeering list a secret.
F46 0360  9       The Department expects and receives no thanks from
F46 0370  8    Congress for its discretion. Congress is a harsh master.
F46 0380  6    State is expected to arrange the touring Cicero's foreign
F46 0390  4    itinerary; its embassies are expected to supply him
F46 0400  4    with reams of local money to pay his way; embassy workers
F46 0410  1    are expected to entertain him according to his whim,
F46 0410 10    frequently with their savings for the children's college
F46 0420  7    tuition.
F46 0420  8       But come the next session of Congress, State can
F46 0430  8    expect only that its summer guest will bite its hand
F46 0440  6    when it goes to the Capitol asking money for diplomatic
F46 0450  3    entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses
F46 0450 10    for its diplomats. The congressman who, in Paris, may
F46 0460  9    have stuffed his wallet with enough franc notes to
F46 0470  7    paper the roof of Notre-Dame will systematically scream
F46 0480  3    that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance for
F46 0490  2    a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the
F46 0490 11    Treasury.
F46 0500  1       In the matter of money State's most unrelenting
F46 0500  9    watchdog during the Eisenhower years was Representative
F46 0510  6    John J& Rooney, of Brooklyn, who controlled the purse
F46 0520  6    for diplomatic administrative expenses. Diplomats stayed
F46 0530  3    up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful coexistence,
F46 0540  2    not with Nikita Khrushchev, but with John Rooney. Nothing
F46 0550  1    worked. In the most confidential whispers ambassadors
F46 0550  8    told of techniques they had tried to bring Rooney around-
F46 0560  9    friendly persuasion, groveling abasement, pressure
F46 0570  4    subtly exerted through other powerful congressmen,
F46 0580  2    tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic
F46 0590  1    corps. Rooney remained untouched.
F46 0590  5       "The trouble" explained Loy Henderson, then Deputy
F46 0600  5    Undersecretary for Administration, "is that when we
F46 0610  5    get into an argument with him about this thing, it
F46 0620  2    always turns out that Rooney knows more about our budget
F46 0620 12    than we do".
F46 0630  2       One year the Department collected a file of case
F46 0630 11    histories to document its argument that men in the
F46 0640  9    field were paying the government's entertainment bills
F46 0650  3    out of personal income. News of the project reached
F46 0660  3    the press. Next day, reports went through the Department
F46 0670  1    that Rooney had been outraged by what he considered
F46 0670 10    a patent attempt to put public pressure on him for
F46 0680  8    increased entertainment allowances and had sworn an
F46 0690  5    oath that, that year, expense allowances would not
F46 0700  1    rise a dollar. They didn't.
F46 0700  6       The Department's constant fight with the House for
F46 0710  6    money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic
F46 0720  1    bloody engagements with the Senate. Armed with constitutional
F46 0730  1    power to negate the Executive's foreign policy, the
F46 0730  9    Senate carries a big stick and is easily provoked to
F46 0740  9    use it on the State Department's back, or on the head
F46 0750  6    of the Secretary of State.
F46 0750 11       With its power to investigate, the Senate can paralyze
F46 0760  9    the Secretary by keeping him in a state of perpetual
F46 0770  8    testimony before committees, as it did with Dean Acheson.
F46 0780  5    John Foster Dulles escaped by keeping his personal
F46 0790  2    show on the road and because Lyndon Johnson, who was
F46 0790 12    then operating the Senate, refused to let it become
F46 0800  9    an Inquisition. During Dulles's first two years in
F46 0810  6    office, while Republicans ran the Senate, the Department
F46 0820  4    was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for its blood
F46 0830  2    since 1945.
F46 0830  4       An internal police operation managed by Scott McLeod,
F46 0840  2    a former F&B&I& man installed as security officer upon
F46 0850  2    congressional insistence, was part of the vengeance.
F46 0850  9    So was the attack upon Charles E& Bohlen when Eisenhower
F46 0860  9    appointed him Ambassador to Moscow. The principal mauler,
F46 0870  7    however, was Senator Joseph McCarthy. Where Acheson
F46 0880  5    had fought a gallant losing battle for the Department,
F46 0890  4    Dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates. Fretting
F46 0900  2    privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized
F46 0900 10    bureaucrats, Dulles remained serene and detached while
F46 0910  7    the hatchet men had their way.
F46 0920  4       In view of Eisenhower's reluctance to concede that
F46 0930  2    anything was amiss in the Terror, it is doubtful that
F46 0930 12    heroic intervention by Dulles could have produced anything
F46 0940  7    but disaster for him and the country's foreign policy.
F46 0950  6    In any event, the example of Acheson's trampling by
F46 0960  3    the Senate did not encourage Dulles to provoke it.
F46 0970  2    He elected to "get along".
F46 0970  7       During this dark chapter in State Department history,
F46 0980  5    men who had offered foreign-policy ideas later proven
F46 0990  3    wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to Capitol
F46 1000  1    Hill. Their old errors of judgment were equated, in
F46 1000 10    the curious logic of the time, with present treasonous
F46 1010  8    intent. Their successors, absorbing the lesson, made
F46 1020  5    it a point to have few ideas.
F46 1020 12       This, in turn, brought a new fashion in senatorial
F46 1030  9    criticism as the Democrats took control. In the new
F46 1040  6    style, the Department was berated as intellectually
F46 1050  1    barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed
F46 1050 10    to outwit the Russians. For three or four years in
F46 1060  9    the mid-1950's, this complaint was heard rumbling up
F46 1070  6    from the Senate floor whenever there was a dull legislative
F46 1080  5    afternoon. It became smart to say that the fault was
F46 1090  2    with Dulles because he would not countenance thinking
F46 1090 10    done by anyone but himself.
F46 1100  4       An equally tenable thesis is that the dearth of
F46 1110  2    new thought was created by the Senate's own penchant
F46 1110 11    for crucifying anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to
F46 1120  7    the next generation.
F46 1120 10    #@ GETTING ALONG WITH FOREIGNERS#
F46 1130  5    THERE ARE ninety-eight foreign embassies and legations
F46 1140  4    in Washington. They range from the Soviet Embassy on
F46 1150  3    Sixteenth Street, a gray shuttered pile suggesting
F46 1150 10    a funeral-accessories display house, to what Congressman
F46 1160  6    Rooney has called "that monstrosity on Thirty-fourth
F46 1170  6    Street", the modern cement-and-glass chancery of the
F46 1180  4    Belgians.
F46 1180  5       Here is the world of the chauffeured limousine and
F46 1190  4    the gossip reporter, of caviar on stale crackers and
F46 1200  2    the warm martini, of the poseur, the spy, the party
F46 1200 12    crasher, and the patriot, of the rented tails, the
F46 1210  9    double cross, and the tired Lothario.
F46 1220  2       Into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries
F46 1230  1    around the earth and an endless stream of home-office
F46 1230 11    instructions on how to handle Uncle Sam in an infinite
F46 1240 10    variety of contingencies. Here are hatched plans for
F46 1250  6    getting a share of the American bounty, the secret
F46 1260  3    of the anti-missile missile, or an invitation to dinner.
F46 1270  1    Out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words
F46 1270 12    purporting to inform home ministries about what is
F46 1280  8    really happening inside Washington. Some, like the
F46 1290  4    British and the French, maintain an elaborate system
F46 1300  2    of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying
F46 1300 10    special areas of the American scene. Other embassies
F46 1310  8    cable home The New York Times without changing a comma.
F46 1320  8       Each has its peculiar style. The Soviet Embassy
F46 1330  5    is popularly regarded as Russian espionage headquarters.
F46 1340  2    When Ambassador Mikhail Menshikov took it over in 1957
F46 1350  3    from Georgi Zaroubin, he made a determined effort to
F46 1350 12    change this idea. Menshikov hit Washington with a ~TV
F46 1360  9    announcer's grin and a hearty handclasp. To everyone's
F46 1370  8    astonishment he seemed no more like the run-of-the-mine
F46 1380  9    Russian ambassador than George Babbitt was like Fyodor
F46 1390  4    Pavlovitch Karamazov.
F46 1390  6       Where his predecessors had glowered, Menshikov smiled.
F46 1400  5    Where they had affected the bleak social style of embalmers'
F46 1410  6    assistants, Menshikov went abroad gorgeous in white
F46 1420  4    tie and tails. Overnight he became the most available
F46 1430  1    man in Washington. Speeches by the Soviet ambassador
F46 1430  9    became the vogue as he obliged rural Maryland Rotarians
F46 1440  8    and National Press Club alike. In Senator Joseph McCarthy's
F46 1450  6    phrase, it was the most unheard-of thing ever heard
F46 1460  6    of. A newspaperman who met him at a reception swore
F46 1470  2    that he asked Menshikov: "What should we call you"?
F46 1480  1    And that Menshikov replied: "Just call me Mike".
F46 1490  1       "Smilin' Mike" was the sobriquet Washington gave
F46 1490  7    him. His English was usable and he used it fearlessly.
F46 1500  8    Toasting in champagne one night at the embassy, he
F46 1510  6    hoisted his glass to a senator's wife and gaily cried:
F46 1520  3    "Up your bottom"! For a few giddy months that coincided
F46 1530  2    with one of Moscow's smiling moods, he was the sensation
F46 1540  1    of Washington. At the State Department, hard-bitten
F46 1540  9    Russian experts complained that the Capitol was out
F46 1550  7    of its wits. Newspaper punditry was inspired to remind
F46 1560  5    everyone that Judas, too, had been able to smile.
F46 1570  2       The Menshikov interlude ended as larks with the
F46 1570 10    Russians usually end. Finding peaceful coexistence
F46 1580  6    temporarily unsuitable because of domestic politics,
F46 1590  5    Moscow resumed scowling and "Smilin' Mike" dropped
F46 1600  3    quietly out of the press except for an occasional story
F46 1610  2    reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the
F46 1610 11    Middle West.
F46 1620  1       The most inscrutable embassies are the Arabs', and
F46 1620  9    the most inscrutable of the Arabs are the Saudi Arabians.
F46 1630  9    When King Saud visited Washington, the overwhelming
F46 1640  5    question consuming the press was the size of his family.
F46 1650  7    Rumor had it that his children numbered in the hundreds.
F46 1660  4    The State Department was little help on this, or on
F46 1670  2    much else about Saudi Arabia. A reporter who consulted
F46 1670 11    a Middle East Information officer for routine vital
F46 1680  7    statistics got nowhere until the State Department man
F46 1690  5    produced from his bottom desk drawer a brochure published
F46 1700  3    by the Arabian-American Oil Company. "This is where
F46 1710  3    I get my information from", he confided. "But bring
F46 1710 12    it right back. It's the only copy I've got".
F46 1720  9       The size of Saud's family was still being debated
F46 1730  7    when the King appeared for his first meeting with Eisenhower.
F46 1740  5    When it ended, a dusky sheik in desert robes flowed
F46 1750  3    into Hagerty's office to report on the interview. The
F46 1760  2    massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides
F46 1760  9    about Saudi-American friendship to bore in on the central
F46 1770  8    question. How many children did the King have?
F46 1780  6       "Twenty-one", replied the sheik.
F46 1790  1       And how many of these were sons?
F46 1790  8       "Twenty-five", the sheik replied.
F46 1800  4       "Do you mean to tell us", a reporter asked, "that
F46 1810  3    the King has twenty-one children, twenty-five of whom
F46 1820  1    are sons"?
F46 1820  3       The sheik smiled and murmured: "That is precisely
F46 1830  2    correct".
F46 1830  3       The Egyptians are noted for elusiveness of language.
F46 1840  3    When Dag Hammarskjold was negotiating the Middle East
F46 1850  1    peace after Israel's 1956 invasion of Egypt, he soon
F46 1850 10    found himself speaking the mysterious phrases of Cairo,
F46 1860  7    a language as anarchic as Casey Stengel's. The reports
F46 1870  6    of President Nasser's pledges which Hammarskjold was
F46 1880  4    relaying from Cairo to Washington became increasingly
F46 1890  2    incomprehensible to other diplomats, including the
F46 1890  8    Israeli Foreign Minister, Mrs& Golda Meir. Finally
F46 1900  7    he reported that Nasser was ready to make a concrete
F46 1910  8    commitment in return for Israeli concessions.
F47 0010  1    The deep water is used by many people, but it is always
F47 0010 13    clean, for the washing is done outside. I know now
F47 0020  8    why our Japanese friends were surprised when they walked
F47 0030  5    into our bathroom.
F47 0030  8       Of course, most toilets are Eastern style- at floor
F47 0040  7    level- but even when they are raised to chair height,
F47 0050  5    they are actually outside toilets- inside. A few newer
F47 0060  4    homes have Western flush toilets, but even with running
F47 0070  1    water, they are usually Eastern style.
F47 0070  7       The next day I visited International Christian College
F47 0080  4    which has developed since the war under the leadership
F47 0090  4    of people who were interned and who know Japan well.
F47 0100  2    They are trying to demonstrate some different ways
F47 0100 10    of teaching and learning. The library has open shelves
F47 0110  8    even in the unbound periodical stockroom. Spiritual
F47 0120  3    life is cultivated, but students do not need to be
F47 0130  3    Christian. They have an enviable record of being able
F47 0130 12    to place in employment 100% of their graduates.
F47 0140  7       In the afternoon Miss Hosaka and her mother invited
F47 0150  6    me to go with them and young Mrs& Kodama to see the
F47 0160  5    famous Spring dances of the Geisha dancers. Mrs& Hosaka
F47 0170  2    is one of the Japanese women one reads about- beautiful,
F47 0180  1    artistically talented, an artful manager of her big
F47 0180  9    household- (four boys and four girls), and yet looking
F47 0190  9    like a pampered, gentle Japanese woman. She was a real
F47 0200  6    experience! The dances were as beautiful as anything
F47 0210  3    I have ever seen- they rival the New York Rockettes
F47 0220  1    for scenery and precision as well as imagination.
F47 0220  9       Because Don was leaving the next day, I spent the
F47 0230 10    evening with him at Asia Center. The following morning
F47 0240  5    Mr& Morikawa called for me, and we went to visit schools-
F47 0250  6    kindergarten, middle-school, elementary school, and
F47 0260  3    high school- Mr& Yoshimoto's school. There is much
F47 0270  3    more freedom in the schools here than I expected- some
F47 0270 13    think too much.
F47 0280  3       There is a great deal of thought being given to
F47 0290  1    the question of moral education in the schools. With
F47 0290 10    the loss of the Emperor diety in Japan, the people
F47 0300  7    are left in confusion with no God or moral teachings
F47 0310  4    that have strength. The older parents continued to
F47 0320  2    teach their children traditional principles, but the
F47 0320  9    younger people, who have lost all faith and convictions,
F47 0330  8    are now parents. There seems to be no purpose in life
F47 0340  7    that is sure- no certain guiding principles to give
F47 0350  3    stability. As a result, money is spent quickly and
F47 0350 12    freely, with no thought of its value. Gambling is everywhere,
F47 0360 10    especially among students. Parents indulge their children.
F47 0370  6       The government has recognized the dilemma and is
F47 0380  7    beginning to devise some moral education for the schools-
F47 0390  4    but the teachers often have no firm conviction and
F47 0400  2    are confused. I was told that it is quite likely that
F47 0400 13    Japanese soldiers would not fight again- for why should
F47 0410  9    they? It will be painful, but interesting, to see what
F47 0420  7    kind of a god these people will create or what strong
F47 0430  5    convictions they will develop.
F47 0430  9       In the evening the former Oregon State science teachers
F47 0440  7    met for dinner at the New Tokyo Restaurant where I
F47 0450  6    had my first raw fish and found it good. They suggested
F47 0460  3    several new foods, and usually I found them good, except
F47 0470  2    the sweets, which I think I could learn to like. Six
F47 0470 13    of the science teachers were present, and we had great
F47 0480  9    fun.
F47 0480 10    #KYOTO#
F47 0480 11    After a day at Nikko, Mrs& Kodama put me on the train
F47 0490 12    for Kyoto. My instructions were that Mr& Nishimo would
F47 0500  8    meet me at the hotel, but instead he and three others
F47 0510  7    were at the station with a very warm welcome. My hotel
F47 0520  4    rooms on the trip were arranged by Masu and the Japan
F47 0530  1    Travel Bureau and were more elegant than I would have
F47 0530 11    chosen, but it was fun for once to be elegant- I did
F47 0540 12    explain to the students, however, that this was not
F47 0550  6    my usual style, for their salaries are very small,
F47 0560  2    and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well.
F47 0560 15    They understood and teased me a bit about it.
F47 0570  9       I think I would have been much disappointed in Japan
F47 0580  6    if I had not seen Kyoto, Nara, and Hiroshima. Kyoto
F47 0590  4    is the ancient capital of Japan and still its cultural
F47 0600  2    center. It, along with Nara, was untouched by the war-
F47 0605  1    and is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of
F47 0610 10    prewar Japan. Here I was accompanied by Mrs& Okamoto
F47 0620  7    (Fumio's mother), her son, Mr& Washizu (a prospective
F47 0630  5    student with whom I have been corresponding for more
F47 0640  3    than a year), and Mr& Nishima, one of the science teachers.
F47 0650  2    I arrived at 7:00 a&m& and by 9:00 a&m& I had finished
F47 0660  2    breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned.
F47 0670  1    We walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens.
F47 0670 10    We visited the Okamoto home- where for the first time
F47 0680  8    I saw the famous tea ceremony. At 6:00 p&m& we went
F47 0690  6    to the Kyoto Spring dances at the place where these
F47 0700  3    beautiful dances originated. They were even better
F47 0700 10    than those of Tokyo- more spectacular and more imaginative.
F47 0710  9       After a supper of unagi (rice with eel- eel which
F47 0720 10    is raised in an ice-cold pond at the foot of Mt& Fuji),
F47 0730 10    I returned to my beautiful room to sleep as hard as
F47 0740  7    possible to be ready for another busy day. We started
F47 0750  3    at 9 a&m& to visit the Kyoto University where Mr& Washizu
F47 0760  2    is attending. I was amazed at the very poor hospital
F47 0760 12    facilities accompanying the medical school. They apologized
F47 0770  7    for the condition, including dirt and flies, and I
F47 0780  7    was a little at a loss to know what to say. There seemed
F47 0790  5    to be no excuse? I don't have the answer yet.
F47 0800  2       We had tea at Mr& Washizu's home where I learned
F47 0810  1    that he, too, comes from a very wealthy family. His
F47 0810 11    grandfather is a Buddhist priest; and he, being the
F47 0820  8    eldest, was supposed to be a priest, but he chose to
F47 0830  5    do differently, and one of his brothers is to become
F47 0840  1    the priest. This is a significant fact in Japan, for
F47 0840 11    only a few years ago he would have had no choice. In
F47 0850 10    his big home live four families and thirty people,
F47 0860  4    so it needs to be big. Also, there are housed here
F47 0870  2    some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600
F47 0870 10    years old- paintings, lacquer, brocade, etc&. He had
F47 0880  9    displayed more of them than usual so that I could enjoy
F47 0890  8    them. About 100 of the most important items he had
F47 0900  4    already given to the museum. The house itself is 400
F47 0910  1    years old with all the craftsmanship of older, less-hurried
F47 0910 11    times.
F47 0920  1    #NARA, OSAKA, AND HIROSHIMA#
F47 0920  4    Mr& Nishima went with me on the train to Nara. We passed
F47 0930  5    his house and school on the way. In Nara I stayed at
F47 0940  3    the hotel where the Prince and Princess had stayed
F47 0940 12    on their honeymoon. A new red carpet had been laid
F47 0950  9    for their coming, but I walked on it, too. Here Mr&
F47 0960  7    Yoneda met us after a three-hour train trip from the
F47 0970  4    town where he teaches. Even though we had walked miles
F47 0980  1    in Kyoto that day, we started out again to see Nara
F47 0980 12    at night.
F47 0990  1       In the evening both of the men went with me on the
F47 0990 13    train 30 miles to Osaka to put me on the train for
F47 1000 10    Hiroshima. Again the plan was for me to go alone, but
F47 1010  7    they wouldn't let me. At Osaka, Mr& Yoneda had to leave
F47 1020  4    us to get the train to his home, but Mr& Nishima and
F47 1030  2    I had an hour and a half before train time to see Osaka
F47 1030 15    at night. It is the second largest city in Japan, with
F47 1040 10    about four million people. One spot in Osaka I shall
F47 1050  7    always remember- the bridge where we stood to watch
F47 1060  5    the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the
F47 1070  1    still waters of the river. In the midst of a great
F47 1070 12    busy city, people take time to enjoy the beauty of
F47 1080  8    natural reflection of artificial light.
F47 1090  1       My train arrived in Hiroshima at the awful hour
F47 1090 10    of 4:45 a&m&. I had planned to go to the hotel by taxi
F47 1100 12    and sleep a little, after which Mr& Uno would arrive
F47 1110  7    and pilot me around. But there he was at the train
F47 1120  6    with an Oregon State pennant in his hand.
F47 1130  1       I know now why the students insisted that I go to
F47 1130 12    Hiroshima even when I told them I didn't want to. They
F47 1140 10    knew that I was still grieving over the tragic event,
F47 1150  5    and they felt that if I could see the recovery and
F47 1170  2    the spirit of the people, who hold no grudge, but who
F47 1170 13    also regret Pearl Harbor, I would be happier and would
F47 1180 10    understand better a new Japan. There were no words
F47 1190  8    to say this but there was no need.
F47 1200  1       The teachers of Mr& Uno's school gave me a small
F47 1200 11    gift to thank me for coming. Hiroshima is a better
F47 1210 10    city than it was before- in the minds of the people
F47 1220  9    I met was a strong determination for peace and understanding.
F47 1230  3    I was grateful for their insight into my need for this
F47 1240  3    experience. A better world may yet come out of Hiroshima.
F47 1250  1    #TOKYO#
F47 1250  2    On arriving in Tokyo later we were met by Masu who
F47 1250 13    took us immediately to her university, the Japanese
F47 1260  8    Women's University. This day was "Open House for Parents"
F47 1270  8    day, and the girls were busy preparing exhibits and
F47 1280  5    arranging tea tables. Everything was in an exciting
F47 1290  3    turmoil- full of anticipation and fun.
F47 1290  9       It was thrilling to see the effect of an American-trained
F47 1300 10    teacher on Japanese students in a class in Home Planning.
F47 1310  8    Our Masu is one of the very few architects in Japan
F47 1320  5    who is trying to plan homes around family functions
F47 1330  2    and women's needs. I am told the time will soon come
F47 1330 13    when women will find it necessary to do most of their
F47 1340 11    own work, and even now it is important to have conveniences
F47 1350  7    for the use of servants. Many of the features of the
F47 1360  6    homes are the latest modern devices in American homes,
F47 1370  2    but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using
F47 1370 11    Japanese artfulness in our own Western architecture
F47 1390  7    at the same time that the Japanese are adopting Western
F47 1400  5    utility patterns.
F47 1400  7       At this Women's University we find a monument to
F47 1410  7    a courageous family who believed that Japanese women
F47 1420  4    also should be educated. Even today there are some
F47 1430  2    doubts about the value of education for Japanese women,
F47 1430 11    but this University continues to grow and to send its
F47 1440  9    students out into the community. Active alumnae have
F47 1450  5    built a fine building on the campus where members can
F47 1460  4    come and stay for a few days or longer and where they
F47 1470  1    can have their social gatherings and professional meetings.
F47 1470  9    As far as I am concerned there is continuous piling
F47 1480  9    up of evidence that the creative fresh ideas which
F47 1490  5    are needed in the world are going to be found by educated
F47 1500  3    women unafraid to break traditions.
F47 1500  8       Masu is also teaching in a municipally-sponsored
F47 1510  6    school for Japanese widows in Tokyo. Here the women
F47 1520  4    learn to keep house as maids; they become skilled in
F47 1530  2    cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests. They
F47 1530 10    learn how to take care of children and sick members
F47 1540  9    of the family. They have model kitchens, a sick room
F47 1550  5    with a model patient in bed, and a nursery with a life-like
F47 1560  4    doll. Although the training is only for one month,
F47 1560 13    it is intensive and thorough. Graduates of this maid's
F47 1570  9    school are much in demand and can always find work
F47 1580  8    immediately. Occasionally they return for additional
F47 1590  3    training. Masu's home economics training comes into
F47 1600  2    play as she designs cupboards along modern functional
F47 1600 10    lines for the storage of cleaning materials. Masu also
F47 1610  8    uses the training she got in an American home where
F47 1620  6    she learned to polish furniture, clean corners, and
F47 1630  2    work effectively in keeping a shiny house. Her education
F47 1630 11    in the United States, not just in a classroom, but
F47 1640 10    also in an American house with an American housekeeper,
F47 1650  6    stands her in good stead.
F47 1650 11    #UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO#
F47 1660  3    After a fine luncheon in the cafeteria, the kitchen
F47 1670  1    of which Masu had planned, Mr& Washizu and I left to
F47 1670 12    meet representatives of the ~USIS for a visit to the
F47 1680  9    University of Tokyo. Here again it was vacation time
F47 1690  7    and there were many things I could not see, but I was
F47 1700  6    able to visit with a professor who is famous in Japanese
F47 1710  3    circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant.
F48 0010  1    The achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch
F48 0010  9    counters not only by wise action by local community
F48 0020  7    leaders but by voluntary action following consultation
F48 0030  2    between Attorney General Rogers and the heads of certain
F48 0040  3    national chain stores should, of course, be applauded.
F48 0040 11    But for it to be just to attain this same result by
F48 0050 12    means of the force of a boycott throughout the nation
F48 0060  6    would require the verification of facts contrary to
F48 0070  3    those assumed in the foregoing case. The suppositions
F48 0080  1    in the previous illustration might be sufficiently
F48 0080  8    altered by establishing a connection between general
F48 0090  5    company practice and local practice in the South, and
F48 0100  5    by establishing such direct connection between the
F48 0110  1    practice and the economic well-being of stores located
F48 0110 10    in New York and general company policy. Then the boycott
F48 0120  8    would not be secondary, but a primary one. It would
F48 0130  7    be directed against the actual location of the unjust
F48 0140  3    policy which, for love's sake and for the sake of justice,
F48 0150  1    must be removed, and, indivisible from this, to the
F48 0150 10    economic injury of the people directly and objectively
F48 0160  7    a part of this policy. Perhaps this would be sufficient
F48 0170  5    to justify an economic boycott of an entire national
F48 0180  2    chain in order, by threatening potential injury to
F48 0180 10    its entire economy, to effect an alteration of the
F48 0190  8    policy of its local stores in the matter of segregation.
F48 0200  6    Such a general boycott might still be a blunt or indiscriminating
F48 0210  4    instrument, and therefore of questionable justification.
F48 0220  1    Action located where the evil is concentrated will
F48 0220  9    prove most decisive and is most clearly legitimate.
F48 0230  8    Moreover, prudence alone would indicate that, unless
F48 0240  5    the local customs are already ready to fall when pushed,
F48 0250  4    the results of direct economic action everywhere upon
F48 0260  1    national chain stores will likely be simply to give
F48 0260 10    undue advantage to local and state stores which conform
F48 0270  8    to these customs, leading to greater decentralization
F48 0280  3    and local autonomy within the company, or even (as
F48 0290  2    the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic
F48 0290 12    pressure to correct injustice) to its going out of
F48 0300  9    business in certain sections of the country (as, for
F48 0310  6    that matter, the Quakers, who once had many meetings
F48 0320  2    in the pre-Civil War South, largely went out of business
F48 0330  1    in that part of the country over the slavery issue,
F48 0330 11    never to recover a large number of southern adherents).
F48 0340  7       In any case, anyone who fails to make significant
F48 0350  5    distinction between primary and secondary applications
F48 0360  2    of economic pressure would in principle already have
F48 0360 10    justified that use of economic boycott as a means which
F48 0370 10    broke out a few years ago or was skillfully organized
F48 0380  6    by White Citizens' Councils in the entire state of
F48 0390  6    Mississippi against every local Philco dealer in that
F48 0400  3    state, in protest against a Philco-sponsored program
F48 0400 11    over a national ~TV network on which was presented
F48 0410  8    a drama showing, it seemed, a "high yellow gal" smooching
F48 0420  6    with a white man. It is true, of course, that the end
F48 0430  6    or objective of this action was different. But since
F48 0440  2    this is a world in which people disagree about ends
F48 0440 12    and goals and concerning justice and injustice, and
F48 0450  7    since, in a situation where direct action and economic
F48 0460  5    pressure are called for, the justice of the matter
F48 0470  2    has either not been clearly defined by law or the law
F48 0470 13    is not effectively present, there has to be a morality
F48 0480  9    of means applied in every case in which people take
F48 0490  7    it upon themselves to use economic pressures or other
F48 0500  3    forms of force.
F48 0500  6       the need that we not give unqualified approval to
F48 0510  3    any but a limited use of economic pressure directed
F48 0520  1    against the actual doers of injustice is clear also
F48 0520 10    in light of the fact that White Citizens' Councils
F48 0530  6    seem resolved to maintain segregation mainly by the
F48 0540  4    use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical
F48 0550  1    violence. An unlimited use of economic pressures for
F48 0550  9    diametrically opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions
F48 0560  8    of any fellow humanity as surely as this would be destroyed
F48 0570  9    by the use of more obviously brutal means. The end
F48 0580  5    or aim of the action, of course, is also important,
F48 0590  2    especially where it is not alone a matter of changing
F48 0590 12    community customs but of the use of deadly economic
F48 0600  9    power to intimidate a person from stepping forward
F48 0610  4    to claim his legal rights, e&g&, against Negroes who
F48 0620  3    register to vote in Fayette County, Tennessee, at the
F48 0630  1    present moment. Here the recourse is in steps to give
F48 0630 11    economic sustenance to those being despoiled, and to
F48 0640  7    legal remedies. This, however, is sufficient to show
F48 0650  5    that more or less non-violent resistance and economic
F48 0660  2    conflict (if both sides are strong enough) can be war
F48 0660 12    of all against all no less than if other means are
F48 0670 10    used. It is also sufficient to show the Christian and
F48 0680  6    any other champion of justice that he needs to make
F48 0690  3    sure not only that his cause is just but also that
F48 0690 14    his conduct is just, i&e&, that, if economic pressure
F48 0700  8    has to be resorted to, this be applied directly against
F48 0710  7    those persons directly in the way of some salutary
F48 0720  5    change in business or institutional practices, while,
F48 0730  1    if injury fall upon others, it fall upon them indirectly
F48 0730 11    and secondarily (however inevitably) and not by deliberate
F48 0740  7    intent and direct action against them.
F48 0750  4       It is clear that non-violent resistance is a mode
F48 0760  3    of action in need of justification and limitation in
F48 0760 12    Christian morality, like any other form of resistance.
F48 0770  8    The language used itself often makes very clear that
F48 0780  7    this is only another form of struggle for victory (perhaps
F48 0790  4    to be chosen above all others). One of the sit-in leaders
F48 0800  2    has said: "Nobody from the top of Heaven to the bottom
F48 0810  1    of Hell can stop the march to freedom. Everybody in
F48 0810 11    the world today might as well make up their minds to
F48 0820  9    march with freedom or freedom is going to march over
F48 0830  6    them". The present writer certainly agrees with that
F48 0840  3    statement, and would also affirm this- in the order
F48 0840 12    of justice. However, it is also a Christian insight
F48 0850  8    to know that unless charity interpenetrates justice
F48 0860  3    it is not likely to be freedom that marches forward.
F48 0870  2    And when charity interpenetrates man's struggle for
F48 0870  9    justice and freedom it does not simply surround this
F48 0880  9    with a sentimental good will. It also definitely fashions
F48 0890  7    conduct in the way explained above, and this means
F48 0900  5    far more than in the choice of non-violent means. R&
F48 0920  2    B& Gregg has written that "non-violence and good will
F48 0920 12    of the victim act like the lack of physical opposition
F48 0930 10    by the user of physical jiu-jitsu, to cause the attacker
F48 0940  7    to lose his moral balance. He suddenly and unexpectedly
F48 0950  4    loses the moral support which the usual violent resistance
F48 0960  2    of most victims would render him"; and again, that
F48 0970  1    "the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous
F48 0970 10    to this object of war- namely, to demoralize the opponent,
F48 0980  8    to break his will, to destroy his confidence, enthusiasm,
F48 0990  6    and hope. In another respect it is dissimilar, for
F48 1000  5    non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent only
F48 1010  2    to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer
F48 1010 13    because it is based on sounder values".
F48 1020  5       A trial of strength, however, is made quite inevitable
F48 1030  3    by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent
F48 1040  1    resistance will be convinced that his action is based
F48 1040 10    on sounder values than those of his opponent; and in
F48 1050  9    warfare with any means, men commonly disagree over
F48 1060  5    the justice of the cause. This makes necessary a morality
F48 1070  3    of means, and principles governing the conduct of resistance
F48 1080  2    whenever this is thought to be justified. The question,
F48 1090  1    then, is whether sufficient discrimination in the use
F48 1090  9    of even non-violent means of coercion is to be found
F48 1100  8    in the fact that such conduct demoralizes and overcomes
F48 1110  3    the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing
F48 1120  1    him. Here it is relevant to remember that men commonly
F48 1120 11    regard some causes as more important than their lives;
F48 1130  8    and to them it will seem insignificant that it is proposed
F48 1140  6    to defeat such causes non-violently. A technique by
F48 1150  4    which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into
F48 1160  1    the very heart of a man and determine his values may
F48 1160 12    often in fact seem the more unlimited aggression.
F48 1170  5       Among Christian groups, the Mennonites have commonly
F48 1180  4    been aware more than others of the fact that the nature
F48 1190  3    of divine charity raises decisively the question of
F48 1190 11    the Christian use of all forms of pressure. Since the
F48 1200 10    will and word of God are for them concentrated in Christlike
F48 1210  7    love, it seems clear to them that non-violent resistance
F48 1220  5    is quite another thing. "The primary objective of non-violence",
F48 1230  5    writes the outstanding Mennonite ethicist, "is not
F48 1240  3    peace, or obedience to the divine will, but rather
F48 1240 12    certain desired social changes, for personal, or class,
F48 1250  8    or national advantage". Without agreeing with every
F48 1260  5    phrase in this statement, we must certainly assert
F48 1270  3    the great difference between Christian love and any
F48 1280  1    form of resistance, and then go on beyond the Mennonite
F48 1280 11    position and affirm that Christian love-in-action must
F48 1290  8    first justify and then determine the moral principles
F48 1300  4    limiting resistance. These principles we have now set
F48 1310  4    forth. Economy in the use of power needs not only to
F48 1320  1    be asserted, but clearly specified; and when this is
F48 1320 10    done it will be found that the principles governing
F48 1330  7    Christian resistance cut across the distinction between
F48 1340  4    violent and non-violent means, and apply to both alike,
F48 1350  3    justifying either on occasion and always limiting either
F48 1350 11    action. Economy in the use of power means more than
F48 1360 10    inflicting a barely intolerable pressure upon an opponent
F48 1380  6    and upon the injustice opposed. That would amount to
F48 1390  5    calculating the means and justifying them wholly in
F48 1400  2    terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals.
F48 1400 10    There must also be additional and more fundamental
F48 1410  8    discrimination in the use of means of resistance, violent
F48 1420  6    or non-violent. The justification in Christian conscience
F48 1430  4    of the use of any mode of resistance also lays down
F48 1440  2    its limitation- in the distinction between the persons
F48 1440 10    against whom pressure is primarily directed, those
F48 1450  7    upon whom it may be permitted also to fall, and those
F48 1460  6    who may never be directly repressed for the sake even
F48 1470  3    of achieving some great good. In these terms, the "economic
F48 1480  1    withdrawal" of the Negroes of Nashville, Tennessee,
F48 1480  8    from trading in the center city, for example, was clearly
F48 1490  9    justified, since these distinctions do not require
F48 1500  5    that only people subjectively guilty be singled out.
F48 1510  3       We may now take up for consideration a hard case
F48 1520  1    which seems to require either no action employing economic
F48 1520 10    pressure or else action that would seem to violate
F48 1530  9    the principles set forth above. There may be instances
F48 1540  5    in which, if economic pressure is to be undertaken
F48 1550  1    at all, this would have to be applied without discrimination
F48 1560  1    against a whole people. An excellent article was published
F48 1560 10    recently in the journal of the Church Peace Union by
F48 1570  9    a South African journalist on the inhuman economic
F48 1580  5    conditions of the blacks in South Africa, amounting
F48 1590  2    to virtual slavery, and the economic complicity of
F48 1590 10    both the government and the people of the United States
F48 1600 10    in these conditions. "**h Billions of American dollars,
F48 1610  6    not only from capital investors but also from the pockets
F48 1620  6    of U& S& taxpayers", this author states, "are being
F48 1630  4    poured into South Africa to support a system dedicated
F48 1640  2    to the oppression, the persecution, and the almost
F48 1640 10    diabolical exploitation of 12 million people the color
F48 1650  8    of whose skins happens not to be white". Both the conditions
F48 1660  8    and the complicity are documented in considerable detail.
F48 1670  4    This leads to the conclusion that "the fact is inescapable
F48 1680  4    that America does have a say in whether or not apartheid
F48 1690  2    shall continue". Our leadership in a wide economic
F48 1700  1    boycott of South Africa would be not only in accord,
F48 1700 11    it seems, with the moral conscience of America, not
F48 1710  7    to be denied because we also as a people have widespread
F48 1720  5    injustice in the relations of the races in our own
F48 1730  2    country, but also in accord with our law, U&S& Code
F48 1730 12    Title 19, Section 1307, which forbids the importation
F48 1740  8    of goods made by forced or convict labor. Not only
F48 1750  6    should this provision be enforced but other economic
F48 1760  3    and political actions might be taken which, this author
F48 1780  1    believes, "must surely be supported by every American
F48 1780  9    who values the freedom that has been won for him and
F48 1790  9    whose conscience is not so dominated by the lines in
F48 1800  5    his account books that he can willingly and knowingly
F48 1810  1    contribute to the enslavement of another nation".
