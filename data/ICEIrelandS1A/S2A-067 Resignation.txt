<S2A-067 Resignation><I><S2A-067$A> <#> I understand that it is the intention of some members of the committee Mr Chairman to put questions to me about these events <#> I welcome the opportunity <.> ans </.> to answer all questions which may <,> which they may deem fit to ask <#> I was appointed Attorney General in September nineteen ninety-one and I assumed office immediately <#> The role of Attorney General I soon discovered is a very wide-ranging one and involves a very heavy workload on many different fronts <#> Apart from being legal advisor to the government collectively <,> the Attorney General is the legal advisor to each Minister and each department of state <,> being required to give advice on a daily basis on all aspects of Irish Law <,> European Law and International Law <#> He has to take responsibility for the conduct of all legal proceedings in which the State is involved <,> not only in the courts in Ireland but in the European Court <,> as well as before the European Commission on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights <#> In addition he has the responsibility for the drafting of legislation <,> transposing European Law into Irish Law <,> the preparation of statutory instruments and other legal documents required by the government <#> He also has responsibility in extradition cases <,> as well as many other responsibilities <#> It has been alleged that I was a part-time Attorney General <#> This is quite incorrect <#> While theoretically I was permitted to carry on practice insofar as it did not impinge on my work as Attorney General <,> in reality I spent as best I can recollect only eight days in court over a period in excess of three years <#> Three of these days were spent in the Supreme Court <,> arguing as Attorney General without fee the Cabinet confidentiality case <#> My routine was to be in my office between eight and eight-thirty a-m and to remain there throughout the entire working day <#> On very rare occasions I attended at the Four Courts for legal consultations <#> These consultations were arranged during lunch hour and never in any way impinged on my responsibilities as Attorney General <#> I was available twenty-four hours every day to the Taoiseach <,> members of the Government and to my office <#> The following <,> Sir <,> is an my account of the facts into which you have been required to investigate by resolution of Da/il E/ireann <,> dated December the sixth nineteen ninety-four <,> <#> I should say that due to changes which have taken place in the different governmental offices since this inquiry was ordered by the Da/il <,> I will refer throughout to the various persons whom I mention by their surname rather than the title of the office which they held or presently hold <#> And <.> thi </.> by this I I mean no disrespect to any office-holders <,> past or present <#> One <,> in the early months of this year <,> while on my own with Mr Reynolds in the Cabinet dining room <,> a general discussion arose concerning the pending retirement of Chief Justice Mr Justice Finlay <#> Two <,> we discussed in quite a general way the question of persons who might be available and suitable to succeed the Chief Justice on his retirement in September <#> In the course of that discussion I indicated for the first time to Mr Reynolds that in consequence of the appointment of the <.> ne </.> <,> if in consequence of the appointment of a new Chief Justice <,> the <.> presidence </.> of the High Court became vacant <,> I would be interested in being considered for appointment as President of the High Court <#> Mr Reynolds told me that he would favour and support my appointment to that position if the vacancy arose <#> In May of this year <,> Mr Reynolds suggested to me that I should inform Mr Spring of my interest in being appointed President of the High Court if that office became vacant <#> Sometime later <,> I believe in early June <,> I arranged to meet Mr Spring after a Government meeting and I informed him of my general interest in being appointed as President of the High Court if a vacancy arose in that office <#> He listened to me and said that he noted what I was saying <#> Not once since that date has Mr Spring ever spoken to me about the matter <,> either to express reservations or otherwise about my aspiration <#> He listened to me and said he noted what I was saying <#> Thereafter Mr Spring never spoke to me again about the matter <#> Over the summer there was media speculation as to who might be the new Chief Justice and who in the event of Mr Justice Hamilton being appointed Chief Justice would become President of the High Court <#> My name was widely mentioned in that speculation <#> Subsequently <,> I became aware of newspaper reports that Mr Spring had <,> quote reservations unquote <,> about my possible appointment as President of the High Court <#> These quote reservations unquote were never stated or enumerated to me <,> nor to my knowledge were they ever detailed to anybody <#> Nor indeed was the basis for these reservations ever made clear <#> Other members of the Labour Party began to speak about the existence of reservations but they never specified what these reservations were <,> or what the basis of these reservations was <#> In September Mr Spring publicly expressed the view that he favoured the appointment of Ms Justice Denham to be President of the High Court <#> She <,> through Chief Justice Hamilton <,> promptly indicated that she would not be available and had not been consulted by Mr Spring prior to this announcement by him <#> I was assured by Mr Reynolds throughout this period that the majority of the Government strongly favoured my appointment as President of the High Court <,> particularly after the appointment of Mr Justice Hamilton to the office of Chief Justice <#> And I was assured that the appointment would be made if I still wished to be considered <#> I indicated on the basis of this information that I was still interested in that appointment if the Government thought it appropriate <,> <#> I was aware that there was a considerable amount of political discussion <,> some of it in Tinnakilly House and some of it between Fianna Fa/il Ministers <,> two Fianna Fa/il Ministers and two Labour Ministers <,> concerning the appointment of a President of the High Court <#> And thereafter <,> I was assured <,> both by Mr Dempsey and Mr Cowan <,> the two Fianna Fa/il Ministers involved in the discussions <,> that such quote reservations unquote as had existed among Labour Party Ministers had been resolved and that the Government would <,> after I had prepared the text of the new Courts Bill be nominated without dissent for appointment to the Presidency of the High Court <#> I was not at the meeting in Tillakilly House <,> I should add <#> The Courts Bill was duly drafted in my office on the basis of the heads of the Bill prepared by the Department of Justice <#> The text of the Bill was approved by the Government on October the eighteenth and published and introduced in the Da/il on November the second <#> In October <,> reports of the Father Brendan Smyth case appeared in newspapers <,> bringing to the attention of the public and to my attention <,> the fact that Father Smyth was serving a prison sentence for certain offences in Northern Ireland <#> The reports also alleged that a request for his extradition had not been acted upon by the Office of the Attorney General here over a seven-month period <,> and that he had returned voluntarily to Northern Ireland <#> I immediately arranged to be furnished with a report by the senior legal assistant in my office in relation to the Father Smyth case <#> The senior legal assistant is the equivalent to the Secretary of a government department <#> The report of this official clearly stated inter-alia that the file had never been brought to my attention <,> a fact repeated in a later report to me and in his report to Mr Fitzsimons <,> uh a copy of which I think members of the Committee have already circulated to them and certainly a copy of which was furnished to me by the secretariat of the Committee <#> I furnished a copy of this report to the Minister for Justice Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn and to Mr Reynolds on October the twenty-fifth and subsequently I furnished a detailed report to Mr Reynolds <,> based on his second and fuller report made to me by the senior legal assistant in the Office of the Attorney General <,> relating to the handling of the Smyth case by him <#> This second report is dated November the ninth nineteen ninety-four <#> On the eleventh of November nineteen ninety-four the Taoiseach Mr Reynolds presented my written report to the Government at a Government meeting <#> And I attended that meeting and answered questions relating to the report <#> I then left the meeting as the next item on the agenda was the appointment of a new President of the High Court <#> I adjourned to my office and remained there <#> And after some time I was informed by the Secretary to the Government that the Government had made a decision to recommend me for appointment as President of the High Court by the President of Ireland <#> Later that evening <,> I was formally appointed President of the High Court by the President of Ireland at A/ras an Uachtara/in <#> On the fourteenth of November <,> Mr Fitzsimons came to my home and conveyed to me the suggestion that I consider my position and-or postpone the taking of the oath of office <#> My recollection of that conversation conforms substantially with the account given by Mr Fitzsimons <,> describing both the meeting on the fourteenth of November nineteen ninety-four and the meeting on the fifteenth of November <#> However <,> from reports of these meetings attributed to Mr Fitzsimons and the account given to the Committee today which I watched on a monitor in an adjoining room <,> there are some points of emphasis which have not been fully appreciated and I will refer to them shortly where they are relevant in the context of this statement <,> <#> I did not consider it inappropriate that the Attorney General should be used to convey a message from the Taoiseach to a judge of the High Court in the exceptionally rare circumstances where such a communication might be appropriate or necessary <#> However <,> I did consider it inappropriate and constitutionally incorrect and improper that members of the Government or the legislature should seek to bring pressure to bear on a judge to resign from office in order to resolve a particular political problem <#> It was in this context that I pointed out to Mr Fitzsimons that I had been nominated by the Government to be President of the High Court and had been duly appointed by the President of Ireland to that office <#> Accordingly <,> I did not accept either invitation conveyed to me by Mr Fitzsimons on behalf of the Taoiseach and Fianna Fa/il Ministers on Monday the fourteenth or Tuesday the fifteenth of November <#> On the <.> fifte </.> <,> on November the fifteenth and November the sixteenth last <,> Mr Reynolds spoke in Da/il E/ireann <#> On the first occasion he strongly defended in a most comprehensive way my conduct as Attorney General and the decision of the government to recommend me for appointment to the presidency of the High Court <#> On the following day <,> November the sixteenth <,> with no apparent change in circumstances <,> <.> orn </.> or in the factual basis which existed for the speech which he delivered on November the fifteenth <,> Mr Reynolds made a further speech in Da/il E/ireann where he introduced for the first time the existence of the Duggan case and used the fact that it had not been brought to his attention by me <,> by my office or by me <,> as a reason to contend that if he had been aware of the Duggan case he would not have gone ahead with my appointment as President of the High Court and indeed <,> would have sought my resignation as Attorney General <#> When the members of the Committee consider the full contents of this statement by me and the statement of other <.> witness </.> <.> s </.> <,> witnesses which I understand will be given to the Committee <,> I believe you will be compelled to find <,> and I require you to so find <,> that there was no factual basis to justify the change in Mr Reynolds ' assessment of my conduct or suitability for office <,> between the making of his speech on the fifteenth of November nineteen ninety-four and the sixteenth of November nineteen ninety-four <#> He was aware of the Duggan case on the Monday and Mr Fitzsimons at his request called to my home to ask me to consider my position or postpone my swearing in as President of the High Court in the light of the <.> discover </.> of the Duggan case <#> When I realised that Mr Reynolds and other members of the government were seeking to involve me in a continuing political difficulty <,> notwithstanding my appointment to the judiciary <,> I decided to resign so that the judiciary would not be further <.> emboi </.> embroiled in political controversy <#> In so doing <,> I was fully conscious that the public perception would be that I had resigned because I had done something wrong or improper <#> <.> Nonethebes </.> nonetheless <,> I felt honour-bound to subordinate my personal interest to the interest of the judiciary <#> In that regard <,> I would like to read <,> for the benefit of members of the Committee the statement which I made on my resignation on the seventeenth of November nineteen ninety-four <,> which I append to this statement as an appendix</I>
