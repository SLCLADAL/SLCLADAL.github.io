<S2B-046 English literature><I><S2B-046$A> <#> I 'm going to look at the concept of English Literature with reference to some Irish contexts both inside and outside the universities <#> I will keep Queen 's University and Northern Irish contexts particularly in view <#> Since the nineteen seventies approaches to Irish literature and to its links with something called English literature had been affected like so much else by the conflict in Northern Ireland <#> This is nothing new <#> Shortly after the Easter Rising W B Yeats lamented <quote> at the moment I feel that all the work of years has been overturned <,> all the freeing of Irish literature and criticism from politics </quote> <#> In fact <,> as Yeats was well aware <,> Irish literature and criticism have rarely been politics-free <#> But this set of relations has fluctuated historically and is being read today in a variety of ways <#> I return to that point later on <#> Of course readings of Irish literature have also been affected over the years by intellectual events outside Ireland <#> At the moment the primary influence from abroad is that of European and Anglo-American literary theory <#> One result of the theoretical revolution has been attention to the history of English literature as an academic discipline <#> Books published on that topic since nineteen eighty-three include Chris Baldick 's The Social Mission of English Criticism <,> Gerald Graff 's Professing Literature <,> Franklin Court 's Institutionalising Literature Eighteen Forty-Eight to Nineteen Hundred and Robert Crawford 's Devolving English Literature <#> These books are concerned in different ways with the politics of English literary studies <#> With the ideologies that have shaped English departments ' literary criticism and the canons constructed by university syllabuses <#> In other words which texts got taught where by whom <,> why <,> and how <#> And which texts didn't <#> Hence the many critiques of the canon from the viewpoint of gender and race <#> So far these questions have not been systematically brought home to Northern Ireland and Queen 's <#> On the other hand although Ireland flickers in and out of general debates about the literary academy those debates themselves only patchily incorporate Irish perspectives <#> In Devolving English Literature written from a Scottish perspective Robert Crawford notes that major literary theorists have tended to avoid questions of cultural identity <#> Obviously in Northern Ireland cultural identity begs another set of complex questions which are part of my concern this evening <#> In fact Crawford 's remark complements the devolutionary emphasis of Franklin Court 's Institutionalising English Literature <#> Court stresses the me/lange of historical contexts that have informed the discipline <#> Like Crawford he points out that English literature was actually invented by the Scots <,> um mainly by Adam Smith as an instrument of self-improvement and as a corrective to the anti-social tendencies of laissez-faire capitalism <#> I don't think Margaret Thatcher knows that <#> Thus Court 's book focuses on the agendas that have operated or clashed within a range of academic institutions in Scotland England and Ireland <#> I 'll be comparing a few agendas that figured in late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century Irish environments and highlighting some factors that have conditioned the relation between English Literature and Irish Studies at Queen 's <#> I hope finally that this brief history may be relevant to the university 's reflections on its own cultural identity and role in the community <#> The current argument in the Queen 's update between humanists and utilitarians tends to dodge local challenges to both these educational philosophies <#> What after all is liberal humanism in Ireland <#> If it exists its history might differ from that of humanism in England <#> And can vocational skills be pursued without regard to cultural literacy <#> In Adam Smith 's terms how much has cultural illiteracy cost Northern Ireland <#> Leslie Clarkson has referred to courses at Queen 's that address objectively and directly the nature of divided societies and mentioned the part played by Irish Studies <#> But the latter in all their aspects and arguments should surely be at the centre of the University 's self-understanding <#> That they are not is shown by Professor Clarkson 's sentence about two cultures differentiated by religion <,> political loyalties <,> history <,> language and traditions <#> On the one hand Irish Studies variously complicate the dualistic model he invokes <#> On the other <,> objectivity is itself a contested point <#> Further there is a delicate issue which has hung over Queen 's for many years <,> as to whether the University should simply remain passive or neutral with respect to the assumptions with which students enter its gates <,> or whether it should do more to raise critical consciousness and to diversify cultural horizons <#> And what about the staff themselves <,> <#> To support the idea that what goes on in a school of English is indeed relevant to these matters <,> I 'd like to quote the testimony of two poet graduates also honorary graduates of Queen 's <,> John Hewitt and Seamus Heaney <#> The phrase Foreign Oasis in my title is taken from John Hewitt 's essay of nineteen forty-five <,> The Bitter Gourd Some Problems The Ulster Writer <#> This is Hewitt 's bitter word for Queen 's <#> Another factor of some importance in the writer 's mesh of problems has been the part played by the university in our corporate life <#> Staffed perforce largely by English and Scots it has remained culturally a foreign oasis amongst us <#> Creative effort has been allowed to go its own way unregarded <#> Throughout the institution in the past <,> little or no attention had been given to the fact that although Queen 's is one of the red brick universities it is in Ulster <,> with its own peculiar conditioning factors <#> Universities are not absolutely necessary to the evocation and shaping of imaginative excellence <,> but at certain times they have played a significant part rather by influence and atmosphere than by direct interference <#> By the way Hewitt says that Queen 's historians and anthropologists at that date had done a better job than the English Department <#> Seamus Heaney is another poet much occupied by the relations and tensions between roots and reading <#> In an article in Fortnight he stylised his double life as a student of English <#> Far from the elegances of Oscar Wilde and the profundities of Shakespeare I was acting with the Bellaghy Dramatic Society in plays about seventeen ninety-eight <,> now playing a United Irishman now playing Robert Emmett <,> <#> In fact this is a false opposition <#> As we shall see the study of Shakespeare let alone Oscar Wilde has been influenced by the Irish question <#> More recently Heaney provided a snapshot of Belfast in nineteen sixty-three which suggests that he has digested Hewitt 's <quote> bitter gourd </quote> <#> Belfast at that time had no literary publishers no poetry readings no sense of a literary identity <#> <quote> In nineteen sixty-two while a student at St Joseph 's College of Education I had done an extended essay on the history of literary magazines in Ulster as though I were already seeking a basis for faith in the possibility of our cultural existence as Northern <,> Irish <,> and essentially ourselves <#> It comes as something of a shock nowadays </quote> Heaney says <quote> to remember that during four years as an undergraduate in the Queen 's University English Department I had not ever been taught by an Irish or an Ulster voice </quote> <#> And he goes on to imply that Irish literature uh didn't appear on the syllabus <#> Heaney himself of course was later an Ulster voice in the English Department and it should be said that the proportion of accents amongst Queen 's academic staff has varied according to economic <,> social and political circumstances since the inception of Queen 's College in eighteen forty-five <#> Nonetheless <,> the absence noted by the two poets had ideological consequences up to the nineteen sixties and the advent of John Cronin <#> It may be a happy ending and the poetry of Heaney and Hewitt together with much other Irish writing now contributes to the rich modular mix offered by the School of English <#> However <,> the eclecticism of modularity can produce its own kinds of apartheid <#> More broadly the work of Hewitt <,> Heaney and other Northern Irish poets has brought into the foreground the intersection between Northern Ireland and literary canons <,> literary history <,> literary criticism <#> It 's no longer possible to see English or Irish literature as a discipline detached from our immediate surroundings if either ever was <#> As a perspective on this intersection I want to sketch the canonical and political agendas of three professors of English in Ireland <,> <#> They are <,> Edward Dowden <,> Professor at Trinity College from eighteen sixty-seven to nineteen thirteen <,> F S Boas an Ulsterman who was professor at Queen 's for four years in the early nineteen hundreds <,> and his successor the Scot Gregory Smith who held the Chair until nineteen thirty <#> I 'll also mention the important debate between Dowden and Yeats and say a word about Daniel Corkery <,> professor at University College Cork from nineteen thirty-one <,> <#> In institutionalising English literature Franklin Court sees Dowden as unusually political even in the later nineteenth-century climate which ensured that quote the mainstream tradition of English literary study had become tacitly more Nationalist and conservative <#> The politics of Dowden 's literary criticism stemmed from his desire not merely to endorse the empire but to defend the Union and the culture of Anglicanism in Ireland <#> Thus although intellectually a post-Darwinian doubter Dowden wrote in his influential study of Shakespeare 's Mind and Art it may be asserted without hesitation that the Protestant type of character and the Protestant polity in state and nation is that which has received impulse and vigour from the mind of the greatest of English poets <,> energy <,> devotion to the fact <,> tolerance <#> Similarly Dowden regarded Shakespeare 's history plays as exemplifying how the noblest practical life may be achieved <#> This was in the Adam Smith tradition and led Yeats to call Dowden a British Benthamite <#> At the same time Yeats contextualised Dowden 's version of Shakespeare by saying he lived in Ireland where everything had failed and he meditated frequently on the perfection of character which had he thought made England successful <#> Later Dowden worked very hard for the Irish Unionist Alliance <,> a lobby against Home Rule <#> Another coincidence between his literary and political interests was an appeal he addressed to selected London literati <#> He records <,> <quote> I wrote to Swinburne <,> Kipling and Alfred Austin for songs for Unionists in Ireland <#> Swinburne at once sent the song <#> It had something about black as creed of priest <,> which I objected would not do for our Catholic Unionists <#> He replied that his text could be changed <#> Beast took the place of priest </quote> <&> laughter </&> <#> <quote> Kipling wrote that if the song came to him he 'd send it <,> but he thought we needed drilling a damned sight more than doggerel </quote> <&> laughter </&> <#> <quote> I replied that the two were not incompatible </quote> <#> In his essay Edward Dowden Irish Victorian <,> Terence Brown notices contradictions between Dowden 's openness to the intellectual currents of his age <,> including his enthusiasm for Walt Whitman as the poet of democracy <,> and Dowden 's hostility to the Irish Literary Revival <#> The clash between Yeats and Dowden was in fact a significant moment for what we would now term centre and margin <#> Although Dowden encouraged the youthful Yeats and admired his poetry he refused to write about Irish authors despite Yeats 's urging <#> Earlier in eighteen seventy-four Dowden had urged the poet Aubrey de Vere not to let so great a subject as Thomas a\ Becket drop for the sake of any Irish heroic subject <#> And he did not wish his own poetry <,> heavily influenced by Wordsworth to be published in quote a specially Irish anthology insisting that it came out of the general mother <,> earth <#> Evidently <,> Dowden claims an archetypal origin for his poetry lest it should prove to be racy with Irish rather than English soil <#> Yet of course the Irish Literary Revival was not so securely rooted itself <#> Its brand of cultural nationalism was criticised both by political Nationalism and by the Gaelic League <#> Thus by historical irony some of Yeats 's views after Irish independence call up Dowden 's ghost <#> For example in the eighteen nineties Yeats had annoyed Dowden when he discounted the Anglo-Irish writers of the eighteenth century <#> By the later nineteen twenties <,> disillusioned by the policies of the Free State <,> Yeats was mythologising these writers as his ancestral stair <#> And indeed studies of the revival often stressed the degree to which it was shaped by distinctively Irish Protestant mentalities</I>
