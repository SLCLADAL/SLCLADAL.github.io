<S2A-051 Multi-media talk><I><S2A-051$A> <#> Uhm <,> creating multi-media materials <#> And I actually changed that earlier on and uh you 'll see it the change <,> rather than courseware because this is part of the presentation as well that will go to uh into to the schools and to to some trainers as well as to how can you get into multi-media <#> What can you <,> what sort of things can you create with it <#> And uh the exciting thing about multi-media is that you can get <,> <.> co </.> computers have got to the point now where they 're powerful enough to do the work for you to a large extent <#> And that that 's really exciting cos that means that you can get straight <,> or pretty quickly uh to the point where you can start making decisions and controlling where you want to go in this computer environment <#> Now the <,> that 's <,> we put together <,> actually the the presentation package that uh is being used to present this information <,> one of the <,> one of the core tools I think uh for for all the projects that were suggested projects in the Bytes for Belfast project <#> So uh <,> we can look at the tools themselves and I think uhm these are the sorts of tools that are available on the Macintosh in uhm <,> for the Macintosh computer <#> And HyperCard and Director <,> those two tools <,> the top one there <,> and the bottom ones are the ones that are being supplied and very exciting tools because you can quickly without any programming whatsoever <,> and that 's really what authoring means so you 're not you know not programming tools they 're authoring tools <#> We can go in and simply by choosing menu options <,> we can put together text <,> <.> w </.> we can put together graphics <,> we can put together uhm <,> film <,> we can put together speech <,> we can put together music <,> and control them <,> or <,> for example the uh suggested music project we can use the computer to control <,> the playback of music via electronic keyboards or control equipment uh for uh technological purposes for the uh the <,> they 're examples of <,> I 'm not actually qualified to talk much about the uh materials at the back of the room that have been designed by some schools <,> but again that 's one of the suggested projects that 's using a Macintosh computer to control uh the production of those materials <#> So a note of reassurance about the ease with which now everything is in inverted commas because the better you do things the more time that you invest in them or the more time you invest the better you you do things <#> But it 's possible to after an hour <,> after two hours <,> to get encouraging results and maybe that 's the maybe that 's an evening or an afternoon session <#> You can produce materials and take those materials away <,> either saving them to tape or a video cassette or on a floppy disc and uhm the progress is actually measurable in that sense that the the uhm results of our endeavours are there <,> they 're visible <,> you can hear them <#> Uh we can <,> we can then uhm take them and display them to somebody else somewhere else <#> So to have a look at how exactly you might be getting photographic materials into the computer <,> using a device the scanner <,> like a uhm photocopy machine connected to the computer which would give you either depending on the scanner I think there 'll be colour scanners uh provided <,> for the centres <,> taking in large screen images or short screen <.> screem </.> <.> i </.> images or bringing into the computer photographic still images <#> That 's one way of getting photographs into this presentation <#> Not the small hand scanner I think the uhm that 's a very handy tool very cheap tool and very flexible tool because you can move around with that <,> but uh we can there are varieties of different types of scanners <#> Just skip Photo-CD that 's not well yes it is uh important <#> Another way of getting images into the computer is simply take your film to the chemist and uh or sorry to Boots in town and say press this onto Photo-CD and uh it will be the case that if you go out with a camera photograph <,> get it pressed onto Photo-CD <,> the equipment the Apple equipment is capable of then accessing those photographic images without scanning them at all and that 's that 's relatively easy <,> if you get images in that way into the computer <,> <#> Now <,> alternatives or there 's a picture of John Anderson last night producing uh his presentation for today <,> and again we can get <,> immediately get the results fast and that 's very encouraging that we don't have to wait for uhm a week even to come back from the developers <#> It 's possible <,> the technology is there to enable you to just go <.> s </.> take the photograph and we could demonstrate it now to the camera and get that photograph into the into the equipment into your presentation <,> into your programme that you 're designing <#> I think that 's <,> that was all the ones there <#> More possibilities <#> Two other suggested projects are the <,> the producing the video <,> and uh the storyboard project <#> Okay again <,> highlighting here a little illustration done with one of the tools that uh would be one of the core materials <#> It 's uh swivel <,> swivel three-D <,> a modelling tool enabling you to create uhm moving images <,> little movies if you like on the computer <#> And the tools are accessible they 're intuitive you don't have to be a programmer in order to go in and create animations within this computer environment <#> Now <,> there are a list of points here uh that could be examined in depth about the video requirements but I 'll just bypass that because the hardware <,> it should be like a black box <#> It should be and it will be like a black box where the equipment is supplied and you connect up the video camera into the computer and simply press a few buttons <,> I 'll demonstrate in a second <,> and you 're grabbing the images you 're grabbing moving images <,> either from the camera <,> a camcorder <,> or from television <,> or from the uh video cassette recorder <#> So there are there 're lots of possibilities there using equipment that 's uh <,> you would be used to perhaps uh a range of those <.> w </.> in the household <#> You click on the <,> bit of luck <,> click on the camera <,> and uh <,> just have a look at a few just a little bit more detail <#> Now that 's I was using this presentation this morning for a different group of uh of teacher trainers and uh they were particularly <,> because they were teachers <,> interested in these particular areas but of course the applications are <,> are right across the board <#> Anywhere where a video camera anywhere the where with the information <,> on television on uh video cassette or uh from a camera itself where that 's important <,> where you want to use it <,> this is the this is the way of working with that <#> Let 's look at uh television and video images <#> Now <,> I warn you I sort of uh <,> before I actually look at this I 'll say that the equipment I 'm using for displaying this back is quite limited uh power and you 're not going to see very large windows of uh movie windows <#> But the <,> for one of the projects the video project it will have the equipment to enable you to actually display full screen uhm movies on the computer <&> plays video </&> <#> Right so we 're actually connecting up to a television and that was actually taken off the disc of somebody else who had connected it to a television and saying <,> start recording <,> stop recording and you 've got the uh the film embedded in the computer 's memory and you can work work with that then <,> move it to a different document and uh maybe save this to tape as well connect this to a video cassette recorder produce a a video <#> That 's one possibility <#> I mention the possibility of grabbing camera images bringing them into the computer <&> plays video </&> <#> That 's a little bit disappointing because there 's a loss of synch there between the lips <,> and then and again it 's not a very powerful <.> mach </.> <.> co </.> uhm <,> piece of equipment to <.> enab </.> that 's been added to this <.> com </.> computer to enable you to do that <#> But I would expect we 'd get better results uh with the equipment that we have <,> that we 'd actually be using within the project <#> Stills <,> been linked up to a television programme which was Understanding Northern Ireland and uh grabs were made <,> just clicking on the screen and saying I want to save that image <#> I want to save this next image in the television programme <,> the next one <,> the next one <#> Now they are some of the uh visual possibilities <#> You can explore the music possibilities <#> I 'm not particularly uhm <,> uh able to do that <#> I don't work a lot with music but the potential is there <#> It can connect to uh a media keyboard and uh you can record to the computer and playback to your computer <#> That 's very flexible for presentations very flexible for the way it 's very exciting it means that I can go in and then I don't have to be as Derek was saying a great musician in order to be able to create <#> But one of the possibilities is creating uhm interactive comics <,> interactive graphic novels <,> uh something an art form <,> of uh a type of future art form <#> Why don't you see these things <#> Because of course people in their homes don't have interactive machines to be able to play back these uh these styles of uh presentations this style of story <#> Nevertheless it 's possible to imagine that you could do that in future <#> We can actually print this out <,> print the materials out as well in uh comic book format <#> There 's John he says who cares let 's stick to KidPix which is a <,> a uhm paint package on the Macintosh <#> These <,> types of uh <,> literature <#> This materials these comics these graphic novels <,> are very much upfront in the sorts of things that I <,> I mean I want to read if I go in and uh pick up a book at a particular age in in town <#> Shattered <,> this is a comic that totally created in the Apple Macintosh <,> <#> The illustrations have been modelled using the tools that are available there <,> <#> Other publications that have come out just recently are The Digital Justice a graphic novel uh again generated entirely on the Macintosh and it would be nice to think and I think not unrealistic to believe that you can go in and you can create models like this and uh produce uh just as I 'm doing a a presentation of which is an interactive presentation <#> We could save it to tape as well we could create animations <,> output materials to tape <#> Okay if I click <,> show you some more examples <,> here <#> Of course very professional productions <#> But the excitement is that you can go in <,> I can show you some of the <.> ma </.> materials that we have designed for <,> for schools as well using tools like this and the tools that will be available to you <,> to go in and start building up objects <,> superimposing photographs <,> applying special effects using some of the software that 's available there <,> to get towards results like this that of course are better the more uhm time you put into it <#> Well I think that that would be an exciting exploration of the potential of this technology as well <#> Of course we can add we can add sound to it <#> We uhm demonstrate how to add sound as well simply by where there is a microphone connected <,> connected to this computer you can record straight in the sound <#> And uhm <,> I think that 's it <#> I think that uhm what have I covered <#> I 've covered the the possibilities of the different media types that you can actually store onto the machine <#> Would you be interested in me demonstrating actually using one of these tools or if that 's getting too much down into the nitty-gritty <#> Or I think I would like to stop there and just ask for some reaction to <,> to what I 've shown</I>
