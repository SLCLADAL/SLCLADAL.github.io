<S1B-008 Enneagram><I><S1B-008$A> <#> Nines take the really big huge things that matter and they diminish them down by saying <,> sure they 're not really that important <#> And they are that important <#> But the nine diminishes that down and so they sort of treat it like <,> it 's no big deal<S1B-008$B> <#> Is that their way of coping <{> <[> do you think then </[><S1B-008$A> <#> <[> That 's their way of coping </[> </{> <#> It 's no big deal <#> And actually nines do get under a lot of pressure and the one thing that always gets them under pressure is a deadline <#> Nines hate deadlines <#> And you know <,> they never produce right up until the last minute <#> It 'll always be the eleventh hour for the nines <#> No matter if you give them something <,> an assignment nine months prior to that <,> they only get around to doing it maybe nine hours before it 's due to be in if even<S1B-008$C> <#> Basically the longer you give them <,> the worse they are at getting their act together<S1B-008$A> <#> Yes yes and <,> and <,> and I mean I was taught <,> my friend Bernard <#> This is the Jesuit priest who taught me so much about the enneagram was himself a nine <,> the loveliest loveliest man in the world <{> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[><S1B-008$D> <#> <[> Why do they </[> </{> fear confrontation and other things<S1B-008$A> <#> They don't because it upsets the harmony <,> it upsets their harmony and that 's<S1B-008$D> <#> Is it fear<S1B-008$A> <#> It 's not that it 's fear <#> It 's it 's about unsettling their comfortability <,> their comfort zone <#> Nines are very much into their comfort zones you know <#> So they <,> and they don't like those comfort zones to be in some way upset <,> you know so conflict especially threatens that and actually nines can actually physically feel that conflict <.> in </.> internally <,> like in their gut <#> They can actually suffer from stomach problems then you know because of that you know because you know it does physically upset them <#> And again the more laid-back they 're looking to us <,> sometimes the more pressure they 're actually under <#> And they 're feeling it <#> You know <.> ni </.> I when when the nine panel got up with Helen Palmer they said <,> like don't be fooled by this <#> The more laid-back we look <,> the more pressure sometimes we 're under <#> But like here we go <,> we 're giving out this <,> again we 're giving out this perception of <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-008$E> <#> So it is only perception then<S1B-008$A> <#> It can only be perception<S1B-008$E> <#> And is that so for all the types <,> it 's only perceptions that we<S1B-008$A> <#> No not all <#> You know but again it 's how we perceive them to be may not be truly what 's <{> <[> going on </[> for them underneath <#> But again <,> it 's what <,> like type nines are usually warm friendly tolerant accommodating uncompetitive <,> okay <#> They prefer a peaceful structure <,> predictable and comfortable life and they like to fit in <#> So they 've a lot of similarities here with two <#> They 've difficulty saying no <#> But again it 's for different reasons <#> The no doesn't like <,> the two doesn't like to say no in case you don't like them and fall out with them and aren't their friend any more <,> and the two thinks <,> oh God if I say no and then that might cause conflict and then och sure it 's just easier to go along and say yes and at the end of the day it may not turn up <#> So that 's alright<S1B-008$E> <#> <[> What 's going on </[> </{><&> later in class </&><S1B-008$A> <#> I mean I know even some of my friends who <.> w </.> and again it 's probably a bit of their sub-type coming in here which differentiates them <#> But they would even keep particular things in the house <,> that you know <,> like even if it was food <,> particular things that if they ever run out of them you would never have to you know actually get up you know <#> You know my nine friend I 'm talking about <,> she lives on her own and she has this list of these particular things <,> like say there were four items and you go to her cupboards and like I always say you 'd think the war was coming <,> cos they 're stocked with all these things that <,> these particular things that she likes and her whole thing is <,> like see if she run out of something <,> uhm rather than maybe get herself up and go to the supermarket and get it <,> she would eat whatever <{> <[> you know was there </[><S1B-008$B?> <#> <[> Something else which they really like </[> </{><S1B-008$A> <#> Something else she really liked but it <,> it was you know rather than that <#> And she would say that she keeps these particular things in storage <,> so that uhm <{> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[><S1B-008$B?> <#> <[> So she </[> </{> wouldn't even go into them<S1B-008$A> <#> <{> <[> Oh she would </[> go into them but she always keeps certainly you know a substantial stock of them <#> Like you know she said if it was a particular type of tuna she 'd buy like ten tins <#> She lives on her own <#> Or if it was a particular type of juice that she drinks she would get in ten bottles of that <#> So she nearly like collects these things uhm and that 's her self-preservation sort of side of her coming out <,> whereas you know rather than maybe have to go out and be use up the energy you know and then like she knows that they 're in the house and they 're there <#> You know <#> So what time is it<S1B-008$B> <#> <[> Oh she would </[> </{><S1B-008$?> <#> <{> <[> Nine o'clock </[><S1B-008$?> <#> <[> Nine o'clock </[><S1B-008$?> <#> <[> After nine </[> </{><S1B-008$A> <#> Any thoughts on nine <#> We can finish off a wee bit on nine <#> Does that make<S1B-008$B?> <#> I know a nine <,> well she says she 's a nine <,> she 's been to your class and her mum as well <,> they 're both nines <#> Her mum is a stereotype nine <,> <{> <[> you can see </[><S1B-008$A> <#> <[> Oh she 's </[> </{> <,> oh God <#> <{> <[> Absolutely </[><S1B-008$B> <#> <[> Absolute classic </[> </{> <#> But my friend isn't a <{> <[> typical </[> nine<S1B-008$A> <#> <[> Oh aye </[> </{> <#> No I know<S1B-008$B> <#> And I 've kind of hinted to her and she said <{> <[> No I 'm definitely a nine </[> <#> I can see a whole lot of things<S1B-008$A> <#> <[> Well I <,> well </[> </{><S1B-008$A> <#> I see a lot of it <,> but she 's actually quite assertive <#> You know I don't see her as having a problem in being assertive <#> There 's certainly aspects of her nine that I can see very clearly<S1B-008$B> <#> The laid-back <,> the<S1B-008$A> <#> Yeah but sometimes I think there 's a lot of six there <,> you know in her as well you know <#> We actually have this<S1B-008$B> <#> Do you think that too<S1B-008$A> <#> Sometimes yeah because I do find her mother <,> you know cos she sent her mother to and <,> she sent her mother to my class and her mother took great offence at me saying that nines were self-forgetting and they forgot things <#> And do you remember she went home and she said <,> I cannot believe <,> do you know what that Nano one said <,> that Nano one said that Nano one said de de de <,> and she stopped off at <,> and they do forget things and her mother <.> w </.> called to her house to tell her all of this and then drove off without her handbag and her coat <#> And then got home and my friend couldn't wait to ring her up and say <,> hello did you forget something<S1B-008$E> <#> And she proved the point that she was making<S1B-008$A> <#> Proved that point that I was making<S1B-008$B> <#> But every single thing you said is the mummy <#> Everything<S1B-008$A> <#> Oh aye <,> you know<S1B-008$B> <#> Won't confront anything <,> <{1> <[1> won't face anything at all </[1> <{2> <[2> <#> And </[2> as you know we 've seen <{3> <[3> the poor woman and everybody <,> </[3> one particular time you know and she was so <{4> <[4> so </[4> she just could not cope with it <#> She didn't know what to do so she didn't do anything <{5> <[5> if you know what I mean </[5> <#> She just couldn't face it <#> And inwardly she was obviously suffering big-time <#> But it 's just <,> it 's funny you said that cos I used to say to my friend <,> are you sure you 're a nine <#> <{6> <[6> Cos she <,> cos see </[6> when you were doing something <,> she would say <,> look excuse me <#> I have to say this to you <#> I don't really like that <#> And I 'm thinking <,> how could she be a nine <#> And yet she thinks she 's a nine but I mean <,> I 'm not sure now<S1B-008$A> <#> <[1> Won't face anything <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[1> </{1><S1B-008$A> <#> <[2> I know </[2> </{2><S1B-008$A> <#> <[3> Yeah <,> yeah <,> uh-huh <,> uh-huh </[3> </{3><S1B-008$A> <#> <[4> Uh-huh </[4> </{4><S1B-008$A> <#> <[5> Anything yeah uh-huh </[5> </{5><S1B-008$A> <#> <[6> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[6> </{6><S1B-008$A> <#> Aye I know <#> Well I would still have that sort of debate with her that she might have a lot of you know sort of six and her mum definitely<S1B-008$B> <#> Oh the mum 's a classic case<S1B-008$A> <#> Oh she <,> but she <,> it 's nearly to the point where it 's funny <#> You know she is <#> You know<S1B-008$E> <#> But Nano <,> can can <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> <,> must everyone be a particular number <#> Can you be between numbers or is there <{> <[> always a dominant </[><S1B-008$A> <#> <[> No there 's </[> </{> <,> no there 'll always be <,> there 'll always be <,> you 'll always be that core number <#> <{> <[> You have a </[> core number <,> you know and <,> and you 'll never change that <#> You know you won't change that <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> You will always be that number <#> You will always be the seven or the four or the two or whatever it is you know<S1B-008$?> <#> <[> You 've got a <,> a sort of a </[> </{><S1B-008$D> <#> Can a healthy nine not be lazy<S1B-008$A> <#> Oh yes <#> You see if the nine is motivated enough <,> yes <#> It 's all about what <,> where the nine lacks is sort of <,> the nine almost needs like outside stimulus to get them going <#> I always think of nines as those <,> you know those old cars where you used to put the<S1B-008$?> <#> Crank it up<S1B-008$A> <#> You used to crank them up and then you 'd crank them up and the engine would start running and then they 're really on a roll <#> Well the nines need that sort of stimulus <#> So in other words if nines uhm are really into something whether it be their work or whatever it is <,> nines are <,> you know it 's not that once they 're on a roll they 're on a roll <#> But again sometimes they lack maybe the self-motivation or the stimulus and they rely on something outside of themselves or somebody outside of themselves <#> There was a a woman in one of the <,> I did a weekend there last year in Crossgar and <,> what do you call that place no not Crossgar <,> Benburb or somewhere and there was a girl there and she was a nine <#> She was a teacher and she was talking about where she really had a very bad patch of stress <,> so much so that it really floored her and she was <,> she had to come out of school like she was moved back to her family home in the country with her parents <#> And of course when the nine really hits low like that it can be total inactivity <,> you know no energy <,> total apathy <,> lose all you know even sort of <#> And I asked her <,> you know I said <,> well what brought you out of it <#> I wish I had 've taped her because she was a wonderful example of <,> she explained it so well <,> this nine under extreme stress <#> And she said her sister was a type eight <#> And her sister came down and demanded <,> right <,> that 's it <,> you 're not lying like that anymore <#> Right <#> Literally pulled her to her feet and more or less <{> <[> dragged her wouldn't </[> take no for an answer <,> dragged her back up and sort of gave her you know you know <,> she said like <,> it took my sister to do that <,> because she just didn't have that in herself you know to help her<S1B-008$B> <#> <[> Wouldn't take no for an answer </[> </{><S1B-008$B> <#> But she must have chosen <,> to go along with her sister <{> <[> I mean she could have put her head down and just ignored her </[><S1B-008$A> <#> <[> Och yeah well </[> </{> she probably yes could well you would be hard to now <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> is concerned and they were saying <,> no you may well have to get yourself in <#> She said that was the start of the <{> <[> road back </[> to sort of health <#> But uhm she said like you know and <,> when I got into that like I mean I could just literally do nothing <#> And total you know inactivity <,> you know <#> But yes <,> that 's that 's not to say that uhm <,> as I say there is <#> Because when they are <,> it was funny <,> when I did the nines in the prison like there was a nine in the group<S1B-008$?> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><&> simultaneous and unclear </&><S1B-008$A> <#> And of course all of them are saying oh <,> he 's not a lazy bastard after all <#> He 's just a nine <#> Whereas they would have referred to him as a lazy bastard because all he seemed to do was sleep <#> You know <,> and nines <,> you know can find it <,> nines could <,> like I 've had one two three <,> three nine men in my classes at different times and at one stage I 'd two nine men together and one of them used to come every week and fell asleep on the chair and he was asleep sometimes for half the class</I>
