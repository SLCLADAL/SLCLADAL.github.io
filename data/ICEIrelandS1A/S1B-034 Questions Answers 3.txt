<S1B-034 Questions Answers 3><I><S1B-034$A> <#> Right <#> Anybody else on this <#> Yes fourth fifth row yeah fourth row yeah <,><S1B-034$B> <#> I think that the actual timing <,> of the decommissioning of arms is something that should be left to the negotiators <,> <#> But I also believe that <.> ess </.> eventually they should be decommissioned whether they 're in the hands of Loyalists or whether in the hands of the IRA <#> And I think that if the Loyalists and the IRA ultimately had their arms decommissioned and if those arms weren't going to be used for either political violence or to drift back into the hands of ordinary criminals the RUC may very well consider it unnecessary uh to carry firearms then <#> Because for a time in the seventies the RUC did become disarmed but <,> I I think it lasted for about six months generally and they had to take their guns back again because they were being shot at <#> You will never see the day I think where you can disarm the British Army <&> laughter </&> because guns are part of their uh equipment and their raison-d'etre <#> Uh but <,> if you do have a continued <.> mil </.> military presence in Northern Ireland you if you have soldiers from wherever they come whether they 're thirty-two county soldiers or British soldiers you will need them occasionally to come to the <.> ar </.> to the aid of the civil power and that may require them to carry arms <#> Indeed it would <#> Uh <,> they would be most necessary to <.> c </.> uh for the assistance of the civil power if the civil powers themselves to which the <.> gu </.> the uh RUC did not themselves carry arms<S1B-034$A> <#> And you speak as a former general secretary of the Garda Representative Body<S1B-034$B> <#> Well <,> perhaps <#> I I <{> <[> want that </[> <&> laughter </&><S1B-034$A> <#> <[> No but </[> </{> <,> you were that <#> No you wanted to <,> sort of point out it 's <{> <[> your </[><S1B-034$B> <#> <[> It 's </[> </{> very much a personal <{> <[> view </[> <&> laughter </&><S1B-034$A> <#> <[> Jack </[> </{> Jack Mariner <#> No I appreciate that as well <#> Anybody else on this <,> <#> Front row here yes<S1B-034$C> <#> Yeah I think that if we go back to the early stages of the Peace Process we had a situation where the definition of the word permanent became very difficult <#> I think that the decommissioning issue could be a ruse again as a slower for the British government who really should take this opportunity of being generous <,> and moving in a very positive way forward <#> And I think the onus is on them now to take up the slack and to push things quickly and very positively forward<S1B-034$A> <#> Yup <#> Yes fourth row third row here yes <,,> <#> Yup<S1B-034$D> <#> Yeah uhm I think it 's uh it 's interesting to hear people sort of <,> criticising the British government for not moving quickly enough and we all would like to see them move a lot quicker <#> But I think <,> we should remember that the British political situation at the moment is such <,> that uh John Major has to be very careful uh with how he approaches the Unionists because he relies on them for a parliamentary majority at the moment <,,> to a certain extent <#> So he has to be extremely careful I think<S1B-034$A> <#> Right I 'll come back to you now in a second <#> Man behind you yes<S1B-034$E> <#> Yes I I <.> thi </.> agree with uh Dr Fitzgerald that uh the foot should be let in very gently on this issue <,> <#> There should be no form of savage absolutism otherwise I would 've thought the <,> uh entire Peace Process could be subverted <#> I think it should be handled very gently<S1B-034$A> <#> Nell McCafferty <,><S1B-034$F> <#> The audience is just getting round to the nub of the matter <,,> that the British government <,,> dares not rush forward now in case they upset the Unionists on whose vote they are <.> defen </.> depending <,> <#> The fact is as we have seen from Albert Reynolds ' leaks this weekend and as we all know as journalists <,> from our informed sources <,,> their joint statement or whatever it 's called is is nearly ready <#> It is nearly time now to produce the goods and say everybody in to talks <#> And the British government <,> at that stage has to say to the Unionists in you all go now <#> And they 'll have to lean on them <,> <#> And they 're afraid of that <#> And so this discussion about IRA arms is a great way of deferring the evil moment for another few months while John Major wonders can he go for another election can he what can he what <#> They 're just it 's a crunch issue now <,> <#> A peaceful issue <#> Let us now <,> say to the Unionists it is time to do the deal and the British government is scared stiff of doing that <#> And that <,> there we are back to the problem of nineteen twenty-one<S1B-034$A> <#> Dermot Ahern<S1B-034$G> <#> Yeah just <,> <.> N </.> Nell you mentioned earlier about the uhm <,> the uh intimidation of of young people particularly uh there 's a study out today of quite interesting results which show that fifty percent of Catholics uh say at least uh who have been surveyed say that they have been uh intimidated <#> This is since the peace fire uh uh cease fire <&> laughter </&> <#> So you know it it just shows you how fragile <,> <{> <[> yes <#> Yes <#> It just shows </[> you how fragile <,> uh the the whole situation is <#> And of course the bomb in Enniskillen is another reminder as to how fragile the whole thing is<S1B-034$A> <#> <[> Of young people <#> Eighteen year olds yeah <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[> </{><S1B-034$F> <#> No it 's not <#> Youse <{> <[> are wrong </[><S1B-034$H> <#> <[> I think </[> </{> it 's a mistake to put too much importance on the British government 's dependence for its majority <,> on the Unionists in Parliament because <,> in any event they and we depend on the unionists to reach an agreement <,> <#> And that 's the crucial thing <#> So even if they had a a huge majority in Parliament they would still have to <,> handle the Unionists carefully and take their time and on a somewhat different timescale to our government here <#> Now I don't fault them for having slightly different timescales <#> I would like to see them <,> more <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> on handling other problems like the arms and you know uh <,,> not having divergences emerging between them <#> That 's another another day 's work<S1B-034$A> <#> Right <#> We 're going to move on <#> Anne-Marie Lawler <,> has another question<S1B-034$I> <#> After four days of the foundation of the new government what lifespan would the panel give it<S1B-034$A> <#> Right <#> Four days into the foundation of the new coalition the Rainbow Coalition what life span <,> <#> Dermot Ahern<S1B-034$G> <#> Well uh I I 'm not sure if I 'd go as far as uh Mary Harney uh went uh when she said it would only last a couple of weeks but then I suppose uh given the events of the last couple of weeks <,> uh it mightn't be any surprise if uh perhaps in the early in the new year it falls <#> Uhm I think it 's it 's going to be extremely difficult really uh for three parties to to to come to an agreement <,> on all the major issues that come before them <,> <#> Uh I think uh Garret who was uh Cabinet a lot longer than I was I was only a couple of months there but you know there is a tendency if difficult decisions come up <,> uh to to fudge on the decisions and put them back <#> <{> <[> Uh </[><S1B-034$A> <#> <[> That </[> </{> was your experience wasn't it<S1B-034$G> <#> Well you know it was my experience that if difficulties arose and I I was uh there I I Cabinet confidentiality I suppose would <{> <[> would make <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[><S1B-034$A> <#> <[> Ah it 's out the window now <#> Don't worry </[> </{> about it <&> laughter </&> <#> We 're going to have a referendum about it aren't <{1> <[1> we <,> <#> We 'll </[1> anticipate the <{2> <[2> results of that and you can feel free to speak </[2><S1B-034$G> <#> <[1> Yeah yes so </[1> </{1><S1B-034$G> <#> <[2> So perhaps </[2> </{2> perhaps on Questions and Answers we 'll have the the agenda of the Cabinet and the minutes of the Cabinet in the future but <#> Uhm you know I think there would be a fudging of decisions that difficult decisions that might have to come up <#> Uhm and I think if you just look at even the appointment of Padraig Flynn today uhm it would appear to me that perhaps Labour have won out in the argument already on this issue where it was obvious from from day one even before this government was formed that Fine Gael wanted to uh jettison Padraig Flynn <.> ou </.> uh from his position <,> and uh that Labour in effect felt obliged because they had already made the decision maybe I don't know when it was three months earlier <,> uh that they couldn't row back on that <#> So I think there 's there 's already strains there <#> I mean if you look at at uh Michael Noonan on on on Saturday uh View <,> Rodney Rice 's programme <,> he seemed to indicate to the to the populace that Padraig Flynn was on the way out and yet <{> <[> John Bruton </[><S1B-034$A> <#> <[> No he was </[> </{> leaving a blank cheque actually <{> <[> for for his leader I thought </[><S1B-034$G> <#> <[> Well I think he was going </[> </{> very near to saying in effect that uh Padraig was on the way out or on the way back <,> and uh that uh <,> that uhm we were going to get a situation perhaps where one of the Fine Gael people were put in <#> But John Bruton put the cap on that this morning I think when he issued a statement saying that Padraig Flynn was going to remain<S1B-034$A> <#> Right <#> Garret Fitzgerald what 's the life span in your view <,><S1B-034$H> <#> Eight years possibly <&> laughter </&><S1B-034$A> <#> Eight years <#> Oh they 'd get through the next election as well and<S1B-034$H> <#> I I think that that people 're missing or Dermot 's missing a couple of points <#> First of all the economic situation <,> is favoured in <,> as favoured now as it was unfavourable previously <#> And the kind of difficulties that arise from trying to find <{> <[> ways to cut spending </[><S1B-034$A> <#> <[> Thanks to Fianna Fa/il Garret </[> </{> <,> <#> Thanks to Fianna Fa/il<S1B-034$H> <#> Uh thanks to a series of governments of which have dealt with the situation you left behind <{> <[> in eighty-one and two </[> <&> laughter </&><S1B-034$A> <#> <[> Most most most </[> </{> of which were made up by Fianna Fail<S1B-034$G> <#> I have the figures in my pocket <#><S1B-034$H> <{> <[> Don't waste your time on them <,> <#> The fact is that we well uh uh don't uh </[> that 's a silly argument <,> <#> Uh but the fact is that if all governments have contributed to it <#> We got half-way there <#> You completed the job <#> And it was well done by the two governments together <,> <#> But the fact is it is a good economic situation <#> There aren't the constraints and difficulties that there were at that time <,> <#> Secondly uhm <,> the programme itself <,> is very detailed <,> and there 's a lot more in it than was in the original Fianna Fail Labour document <#> And above all it contains clear <,> criteria for public spending <,> which are agreed by everybody so that the question of quarrelling over how much <,> <.> in </.> increased spending by doesn't arise <#> And that is that I know from past experience <,> <&> laughter </&> uh will make things enormously easier<S1B-034$A> <#> <[> Garret <,,> I I I can I can remember <,,> <#> Okay </[> </{><S1B-034$A> <#> That gave you <{> <[> a problem </[> with Dick Spring<S1B-034$H> <#> <[> Thirdly </[> </{><S1B-034$H> <#> Well it was a problem
