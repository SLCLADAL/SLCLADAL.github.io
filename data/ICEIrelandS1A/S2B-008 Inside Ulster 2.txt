<S2B-008 Inside Ulster 2><I><S2B-008$A> <#> Peat is being taken for sale commercially from Northern Ireland 's declining number of bogs without planning permission <#> Strangely <,> according to the Department of the Environment <,> this is not actually against the law <,> although they do say it is in breach of planning control <#> So environmentalists now want the planners to act to save the boglands by putting more emphasis on conservation<S2B-008$B> <#> Northern Ireland 's peat bogs are a vital home for rare plant and animal life <#> Under a government scheme four important peatland areas are to be given special protection by the end of the summer <#> In another development Fermanagh District Council plans to buy three thousand acres of peatland here on Cuilcagh Mountain <,> and turn it into a nature reserve <#> Now conservationists say smaller bogs must be protected as well<&> comment from US speaker </&><S2B-008$B> <#> While some large areas of bogland are to be protected many small bogs are being excavated <,> often without approval <#> The Department of the Environment has confirmed that this farmer near Balnamallard in Fermanagh is extracting peat from his land without the necessary planning permission <#> These pictures were taken after the DOE wrote to him asking him to stop<S2B-008$C> <#> Do the Department know that we 've been continuously operating here for fifty years <#> Before any planning permission was ever mentioned <#> We 've never before been confronted <,> only quite recently <,> and we see no reason at all why we need that permission <#> People comes with their cars and trailers here <,> <.> ks </.> an odd fellow <,> a market gardener or whatever sends an odd lorry <,> and we fill him here if he wants it <#> And it 's <,> it 's really only a very small sideline for us <#> Our main object is to get this turned into a field<S2B-008$B> <#> Environmentalists say planners must play a greater role in helping protect boglands by placing more emphasis on conservation<&> English speaker from Friends of the Earth </&><S2B-008$B> <#> At the moment only six percent of the country 's natural boglands remain <#> So far it 's difficult to gauge how planners here at DOE headquarters will respond to this call from environmentalists <#> The Department refused to put forward a spokesman to discuss its planning procedures and their enforcement in relation to peat bog extraction <#> But conservationists say it 's an issue that won't go away<S2B-008$A> <#> Now the headlines so far this evening <,> the European Commission says the new <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> factory could damage Europe 's textile industry <,> <#> Calls for an inquiry into bread prices are rejected at least for the present <#> And coming up <,> putting on the style at Clogher Valley 's big day out<S2B-008$D> <#> The Northern Ireland Office has brought in emergency legislation to cope with remand prisoners who were moved following riots which damaged cells at Crumlin Road Jail <#> Sixty-eight cells were badly damaged earlier this month and two hundred Loyalist and Republican prisoners were moved to the Maze prison <#> Normally they would have to be remanded every twenty-eight days <,> but because of the practical problems of transporting about eighty prisoners a day from the Maze to Belfast <,> the Secretary of State has temporarily changed the law <#> They can now be remanded in their absence <#> By September a remand court will be installed at the Maze and the legislation should be revoked <,> <#> An incendiary device has been found at a furniture showroom in Belfast <#> It was discovered by workers clearing up at Fairbank 's in Boucher Crescent in the south of the city <#> The showroom was the target of firebombers last week when much of the stock was <.> destroy </.> <,> was damaged <#> It 's thought that the device discovered today was one of those left in the store last week <#> It was made safe by the army and has been taken away for examination <,> <#> Several people <,> I beg your pardon <,> Belfast will become a smokeless zone within the next two years according to the Council <#> It 's warning householders they could be fined if they don't convert to cleaner fuels <#> The aim is to reduce pollution levels but health professionals and environmental groups say Belfast 's air quality is still among the worst in the UK <#> Marie Irvine reports<S2B-008$E> <#> Coronation Street style smoking chimneys should officially be a thing of the past in Belfast as the programme to convert the city to smokeless fuels reaches its final stages <#> More than ninety percent of Belfast is already covered by smoke control orders <#> The council says its conversion programme is on target to be complete by nineteen ninety-six <#> It 's offering financial help to people to get them to change over to cleaner fuels<S2B-008$F> <#> The standard grant is a seventy percent grant whereby Belfast City Council will pay seven tenths of the approved cost of doing work <#> If someone cannot afford to pay the three tenths involved <,> then further grants up to a maximum of a hundred percent are available to the like of old age pensioners or people on Income Support<S2B-008$E> <#> But environmental campaigners say despite the Council 's best efforts to encourage conversion <,> the city still has poor air quality<S2B-008$G> <#> In general the UK has improved their uh <.> su </.> sulphur dioxide and smoke emissions uh but uh here in Northern Ireland we seems to have gone really uh in a <.> r </.> in a roundabout and we 're back to levels that are comparable to the nineteen seventies<S2B-008$E> <#> The City Council 's currently trying to get people to convert to smokeless fuels <#> Will that alleviate the air quality problem any<S2B-008$G> <#> Uh it will help reduce the air <,> or improve the air quality somewhat <,> but it will not go towards uh getting it below the EEC directives for uh smoke and sulphur dioxide <,> and it will certainly not get it below the World Health Organisation recommended levels<S2B-008$E> <#> But Jim Hanna insists things have improved<S2B-008$F> <#> If someone was to think back to the early nineteen sixties and the heavy smogs across Belfast city <,> they are no longer evident <#> Uh levels of smoke and sulphur dioxide are approximately a fifth of what they were in those days <,> so a tremendous advantage has been uh accrued from the smoke control programme<S2B-008$E> <#> Anyone who wants to know more about converting their heating system should contact environmental health officers through the City Council<S2B-008$D> <#> Several people have been arrested following the discovery of a grenade in a launcher inside a wheeled bin in North Belfast <#> A police patrol discovered the grenade outside a house in Hillman Street in the New Lodge area around midnight <#> A command wire led into an entry at the back of nearby houses <#> After a security operation the device was taken away for examination<S2B-008$A> <#> Well if you fancy brushing up your juggling <,> aerobatics and unicycling <,> then uh you 're just at the right age <.> t </.> as well <,> the Belfast Community Circus School is the place for you <#> The voluntary organisation has set up an international camp under the shadow of the Mournes at Newcastle in County Down <#> Everything you could want <,> including a big top and glamorous trapezes <#> Marie-Louise Connolly joined the young performing hopefuls at Donard Park today<S2B-008$H> <#> Welcome to Belfast Community Circus School <#> For twenty-five kids it 's an opportunity to get a taste of circus life and prepare for a Big Top show in Donard Park this Saturday <#> Throughout the summer there have been three different camps with children as young as ten dabbling in acrobats that would make any adult cringe<&> comment from US speaker </&><S2B-008$H> <#> The children come from both sides of the community and landed a part in the circus ring by simply answering an ad in the newspaper<S2B-008$I> <X> <#> I think it 's a fantastic thing for all people to come and learn circus stuff and <,> all <,> like unicycle <,> stilts <,> juggling <,> all that there stuff is great </X><S2B-008$H> <#> The circus school has been running for ten years <#> All the organisers ask for is a little imagination and a sense of fun<&> US speaker </&><S2B-008$H> <#> Josh Wray who 's deaf came all the way from the United States to take part <#> His mum says she 's confident the kids are in safe hands<&> US speaker </&><S2B-008$H> <#> If you feel like rolling up and joining the magic the circus is here for another fortnight <#> Or perhaps just sit back and enjoy the show on Saturday which starts at three o'clock<S2B-008$A> <#> I 'll not try that just yet I think <#> More traditional sport now <,> uh in tonight 's sport the Irish Commonwealth Games take to the catwalk <,> and Glentoran have a surprise for their Scottish visitors <#> Here 's Jerome Quinn<S2B-008$J> <#> Thanks Sean <#> Pictures from the Oval in a moment but first Jamie Nicholl is to meet his chairman at Raith Rovers tonight <,> following reports the Killmarnock want him as their new manager <#> Nicholl has heard nothing uh yet official about Killmarnock 's interest and wants to clarify the situation <#> St Johnstone were at the Oval last night with new signing George O'Boyle <,> who showed some nice touches but failed to mark his debut with a goal against Glentoran <#> In fact the former Blue man was robbed <,> just before an excellent move that led to the only goal <,> the Glens ' first real attack of the game <,> Alan Nixon who apparently reminds manager Tommy Cassidy of himself twenty-five years ago with the perfect cross for Derek Swann to score a super goal<S2B-008$K> <#> I find these <,> pre-season games <,> necessary <#> But they 're uhm <,> you can't get a <.> f </.> a real uhm <,> today for instance I felt that we didn't pass the ball right <,> we didn't have enough passes <#> That 's my game and I intend to bring that in every time we play <#> And I hope we improve every <.> s </.> uh pre-season game<S2B-008$J> <#> Meanwhile George O'Boyle has another game tonight at Ards <,> and he hopes for better luck and that his move to St Johnstone will help keep him in Brian Hamilton 's international plans<S2B-008$L> <#> I had a chat with Brian <#> Uh he says like obviously <,> he would like to play me at the highest level I can <,> uh but he knew St Johnstone are a good club and an imaginative team and uhm he says if I 'm playing well and scoring goals then he 'll come and look at me<S2B-008$J> <#> And there 's two other games tonight <,> Cliftonville against Southampton and Bangor against Grimsby <#> At the Milk Cup the draw for the under sixteen quarter finals features only one local team <,> County Down who 'll play Russia at Limavady tonight <#> Manchester United play at Ballymoney <#> The other game 's at Coleraine <#> Gaelic football <,> Peter Withnall <,> the Down All-Ireland semi-final hero from three years ago is in a race against time to play in this year 's semi-final <#> He 's on crutches after a cartilage operation <,> though with more than two weeks to recover Down are hopeful that he 'll be available for selection <#> And Donegal will name one of these three as their new manager sometime this evening <#> P J McGowan in the centre is the favourite ahead of Martin McHugh and Donal Reid <#> Right let 's go racing <#> The Galway Plate at the Galway Festival this afternoon was worth fifty thousand pounds <,> and featured Richard Dunwoody on Will Phone <#> Here 's the closing stages<&> Southern commentary </&><S2B-008$J> <#> Very close finish there <#> Feathered Gale just catching Minister For Fun on the line <#> Richard Dunwoody was out of contention<S2B-008$M> <#> Finally at a Belfast hotel today the catwalk was reserved for the men and ladies of Northern Ireland 's Commonwealth Games team <,> as they modelled the ninety-four lines for the Victoria showpiece <#> It wasn't quite The Clothes Show <,> although boxer Paul Douglas did his very best in a white towelling dressing gown number <#> The sweatsuits certainly met with approval from the knowledgeable fashion-conscious audience <#> And although rainfall is not high on Vancouver Island at this time of year <,> cyclist Conor Henry was on parade in the wet weather gear<S2B-008$M> <#> Is it important for athletes when you 're going out <,> it 's something to think about <,> gear <,> or are you really just worried about the competition<S2B-008$N> <#> Uh I think it always helps <,> you know it 's actually <,> adds that bit of motivation <#> You really feel as though you 're you 're going somewhere or you 're doing something important <#> And that that can be the extra boost <,> you know <,> quite often in sport the bit that makes the difference at the end is motivation and high morale</I>
