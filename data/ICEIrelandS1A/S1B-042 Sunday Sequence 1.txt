<S1B-042 Sunday Sequence 1><I><&> music </&><S1B-042$A> <#> Good morning and welcome to Sunday Sequence with me Patrick Speight <&> music </&> <#> In the wake of the publication of the Opsahl Commission report we hear a response from the Churches <#> We ask leading churchmen to assess the role of their own denominations <#> And as the new Moderator of the Presbyterian Church calls for a return to basic Christian values <,> we hear the concerns of some women ministers within that church who fear a theological swing to the right <#> <&> music </&> Also on the programme we join pilgrims going to the island of Inishmacsaint in County Fermanagh <#> Morning service at half past ten comes from Gilnahirk Presbyterian Church in Belfast <&> music ends </&> <#> Back to basics <,> that 's the theme the incoming Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland <,> the Reverend Dr Andrew Rodgers has chosen for his year in office <#> Last Monday evening Dr Rodgers was installed at a service at Church House in Belfast where he succeeded the Very Reverend Dr John Dunlop <#> During his term of office the new Moderator intends to lead a personal crusade <,> to make the Christian message more apparent in society here <#> And that was the main area of discussion when I spoke to the Moderator at Church House during last week 's General Assembly <#> First though did he feel that a useful asset for any moderator at general assembly was a sense of humour<S1B-042$B> <#> Well have I found often Patrick that <,> whenever a situation gets a little bit tight whether in session committee or any other <.> c </.> meeting that if you can inject a little humour <,> without going too far I think it very often eases the situation and some things that people 're getting uptight about they ease off and perhaps it does help to to to bring a a a satisfactory conclusion to the whole matter <#> I 've been I suppose blessed with a warped sense of humour or cursed with it whatever way you like to put it <,> that leaves me that I 've got to be a little bit careful in case I don't say too much too soon<S1B-042$A> <#> And yet you 've got a wonderful sense of humour <,> but some people might say that uh you know the uh <,> the principles upon which you are uh basing your <{> <[> theme </[> <,> of office this year lack humour because it 's back to moral censorship <,><S1B-042$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1B-042$B> <#> No it 's not back to moral censorship <#> It 's back to <,> moral programme as God lays it out for us <#> I don't want to be seen to be censoring people <#> God leaves out for us clear rules for good wholesome living <,> and I 'm trying to point the Church and the people that they will I hope uh in some way or other influence back to the basic principles of good wholesome living <,> not a a a censorious business at all but rather here 's the right way to live <#> God made us <,> he redeemed us by his son and here 's the way to live <#> That 's what he 's saying and that 's what I 'm trying to point them back to<S1B-042$A> <#> But do you think people are going to listen to you<S1B-042$B> <#> I sincerely hope they do <#> We 've been saying this again and again but not nearly often enough not nearly clearly enough maybe not nearly <,> specifically enough<S1B-042$A> <#> Is that because people see the Church <,> as a club <,> a social club<S1B-042$B> <#> I 'm afraid to say that many cases they do <#> And that 's just a sad business if they do because it 's not <#> It 's the gathering of God 's people together and it 's a matter of them going out with the message that they 've been given to tell others how to live in a way that is pleasing to God and that as the result of it being pleasing to God will be wholesome and happy for them<S1B-042$A> <#> Do you feel that perhaps some of the language that you used <,> might have been seen as perhaps a little insensitive <#> I 'm thinking about your reference to gay and saying that that was an inept euphemism <#> It 's a way they like to describe themselves <#> They would consider homosexual to be too clinical perhaps derogatory<S1B-042$B> <#> Well I think that homosexual has overtones that are uh as you have mentioned that may be unhappy <#> My problem with the word gay is that I always associated in the past gay with a a happy note <,> a a pleasant note <#> For and this to attach that word to what is after all something that a tendency that they 've been born with which is not happy <,> to me is very sad <#> Now I want to make it very clear that I did not condemn homosexuals <#> Not at all <#> I said quite simply that the Bible teaches that homosexuality is wrong in the sight of God <#> And that we as a church and this is what I was trying to do <,> we as a church must get alongside those who have this tendency as we must get alongside those who are <.> lu </.> uh have the tendency to alcoholism and get alongside them and try to help them to resist a tendency that they 've been born with or that they have eventually found within themselves and fight that tendency <#> The tendency itself is not sin<S1B-042$A> <#> But how can you manage to do that successfully when you 've already criticised your own Church in a sense for being more like a social club <#> I mean you would like to see uh a kind of moral regeneration <{> <[> taking </[> place within the Presbyterian community and of <.> co </.> I suppose other communities as well but where would you locate what you see as the moral decay <#> What has brought it about<S1B-042$B> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><S1B-042$B> <#> Well I think isn't it really so that it 's because of a turning away from God and the right ways of living <#> Righteousness says the Bible <,> exalteth a nation but sin <,> is a disgrace to any people <#> And the people have turned from God and from righteousness and we are trying to call them back to the right way of living<S1B-042$A> <#> But you see people who perhaps <,> commit these <{1> <[1> sins </[1> alcoholism or shoplifting which you say should <{2> <[2> be called theft </[2> <#> They 're already the marginalised <#> They feel that <,> perhaps they haven't turned away from God but society has turned away from them <#> It 's deprived them of employment <#> It 's deprived them of good housing <,> and <,> they might get the feeling that you are admonishing them without really taking into consideration the real reasons behind perhaps <,> <{3> <[3> shoplifting </[3> <#> If you 've got a if you 're a mother and you 're single parent <,> and you you haven't got enough money well then of course you 've got to feed your child <#> You might go in to Woolworth 's and lift something<S1B-042$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1B-042$B> <#> <[2> Yes yes </[2> </{2><S1B-042$B> <#> <[3> Well if if </[3> </{3><S1B-042$B> <#> Yes I take your point that we 've got to recognise why they do this <#> And we 've got to come alongside them and try to help them <#> And that 's why I 'm very happy that in this year I will have the opportunity to work with the other Churches and to work closely with them <,> in for there are many areas that we can share together <#> There 's this area of unemployment that you 've just mentioned and we are interested in doing all we can at every area in every place for that uh particular problem <#> And one of the things that we noticed particularly is for example in the Shankill Road Mission we 're employing a hundred and seventy <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> workers <,> and in Carlisle House we 're doing some more of that same sort of thing <#> We 're interested in unemployment and we can do it far better together <,> as the different Churches coming together in these sort of things <#> We 're we 're uniting in education <#> We 're uniting in the moral issues <#> I 've a great deal in common with the Roman Catholic Church in their attitude <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> all such uh moral issues the the whole business of the <.> sa </.> <.> sa </.> sanctity of life and the and and family values <,> <{> <[> and law and order </[><S1B-042$A> <#> <[> <.> Ye </.> <.> ye </.> <.> ye </.> </[> </{> yes of course but in relation to naming the sin<S1B-042$B> <#> Yes<S1B-042$A> <#> Do you not feel that perhaps you put too much emphasis <,> on those sins and I put it in inverted commas committed <,> by people who are marginalised <#> For example theft is is a poor person 's sin as it were <#> What about <{> <[> the rich <#> What about the rich </[> people 's sin <#> You know <.> in </.> insider dealing corruption in high places<S1B-042$B> <#> <[> Not always just not <,> ah but </[> </{><S1B-042$B> <#> Not not not always at all by it it it it the the it 's the poor person 's sin <#> Very very often sure in high places I I I quoted where they 're they 're robbing the hospitals at a huge rate and the and at high levels we 're getting huge amounts of money being embezzled in every area <#> It 's right across the board <#> It 's not uh confined to the poor people <#> You can understand the reason for the poor people doing it because they are so poor but in the case of the rich sin 's still sin and there 's still rich <,> uh going for theft and all the other things <#> I know of some person uh not so very long ago uh connected with us indirectly who is very well off <,> and who was absolutely up to the eyes in making money through what is nothing short of theft<S1B-042$A> <#> Moderator I wonder if I could ask you <,> to reflect on this <#> You come from the country <#> You come from Dungannon<S1B-042$B> <#> That 's right <#> Tyrone among the bushes<S1B-042$A> <#> Tyrone among the bushes<S1B-042$B> <#> How about that <&> laughter </&><S1B-042$A> <#> Is there a different in approach to moral values family values <,> between people who live in the rural areas of Ireland and those who live in the urban centres<S1B-042$B> <#> Yes I think you 've touched on a point that 's very valuable <#> When people live on a farm for example <,> all the children are expected to gather together and help out on the farm <#> They don't get paid for doing that <#> It 's just part and parcel of living <#> They get to know that there is required of them co-operation and concern and they live together in a family bunch <#> Also they see different things happening on a farm animals being born and so forth and they get a a a interest into and a and a an insight into <,> uh <,> sex to be quite blunt <,> through just living on the farm and seeing the animals and so forth being born <#> And there 's a wholesomeness of attitude to nature and to sex and to all that sort of thing and the family unit <#> And very very often in the country you still find uh the vestiges of family worship and family discipline <,> and indeed family fun <#> They go off for the day together as a family <#> And of course in the old country churches the family pew and family grace before meals comes in <#> There 's a lot to be said for being brought up in the country <#> There 's a a solidity and a depth of of uh goodwill that 's found there that I don't think the town dweller and the city dweller particularly uh have the benefit of<S1B-042$A> <#> Moderator thank-you for joining us on Sunday Sequence<S1B-042$B> <#> And thank-you for having me<S1B-042$C> <#> The new Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland Dr Andrew Rodgers <#> And there 'll be more from the General Assembly later in the programme <&> music </&> <#> Last Wednesday morning the media crowded into the launch of a citizen s' enquiry <,> the Opsahl Commission 's Report on Northern Ireland <#> The result of over five hundred and fifty submissions from various church and secular groups <,> whose main concern was to find a solution to the Troubles in Northern Ireland <#> From the start of its deliberation the Opsahl Commission had a difficult task <#> MP Ken Maginnis dismissed it <#> The Northern Catholic Bishops failed to make a contribution <,> and some Republican community activists were suspicious of making a submission for fear of being politically vetted <#> Apart from the SDLP who preferred to study the documents before giving a considered opinion <,> the other parties were clear about how they felt</I>
