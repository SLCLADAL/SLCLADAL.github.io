<S2A-029 Biochemistry talk><I><S2A-029$A> <#> I think the initial reactions <,> can be summed up <,> in one or two <,> words <,> absolute total shock <#> It was bad enough when we discovered that we were allocated into <,> groups you know <unclear> two words </unclear> <#> But when we discovered that the experimental section was lacking a method <,> well we seriously began to weigh up our options <#> I think our first option must 've been <,> leave the country <,> but due to student <,> grants this didn't seem feasible <#> But not to despair we had another option <,> change degree course <&> laughter </&> <#> But unfortunately <,> due to university policy the only <,> alternative degree course was Mongolian Basket Weaving <#> So <,> after all that we decided we 'd give it a go <,> <#> So the first stage was getting organised into teams <,> and this was actually quite difficult <#> The course consisted of a hundred and thirty students <,> so trying to find other team members proved <,> quite a hassle <#> And at one stage the lecturer actually had to come to the front <,> and call the group members up and say now look these are your group members <#> And the rest of that day was basically just getting acquainted with the other group members <#> So on to the <,> planning stage <#> Well the group members came along all with their individual ideas and these were pooled and a common <,> approach to the problem <,> was drawn up <#> And I think at this stage it became apparent that leaders were beginning to emerge <,> either naturally or <,> by election <#> And how each group <,> decided to carry out their work <,> uh <,> was a personal thing <#> Some groups decided that <,> all the members would participate in all aspects <,> and other groups decided that <,> two students would maybe carry out experimental work and two would do research round the area <#> So the next stage was to put the plan into action <#> And before any experimental work could begin each group had to consult a designated lecturer <#> And this was basically just to ensure that each group was headed in the right direction <#> And I must point out at this stage that the first consultation <,> was free but subsequent ones had to be paid for so this incorporated a financial aspect <,> as well <#> And we had approximately two weeks in which to carry out th' experiment <#> So at the end of the <,> two-week period each group got their results <,> and cost and analysed them <,> to see if anybody had developed an economically feasible method <#> But I don't think we 'll go into this area in too much detail <&> laughter </&> <,> <#> And the exams were imminent at this stage so it was all but forgotten about over the exam period <#> But th' exams came and went and <,> presentation day was looming <#> And I think panic set in at this stage <#> And believe me you 've never seen so many students in so short a time learn how to use a computer <#> It was <&> laughter </&> just absolute chaos <#> And <,> personally speaking our group <,> at ten o'clock the night before the presentation <,> were waiting for the conclusions to come out of <,> out of the printer and if we thought we were cutting it fine <,> well the computer room the next morning was a different story <#> But somehow all the students managed to get their posters in place and up for the stipulated time <#> And I think this was the first time we could actually sit back and breathe a sigh of relief <#> The pressure was off and the panic was over <#> And this was the first chance that we had to meet any prospective employers <#> And <,> I think they did have quite a lot of influence on <,> the effort that students did put into their work <#> I somehow didn't feel if it had been just for the lecturers <,> we we would 've put in as much work <#> And John must 've had a very hard <,> job judging the posters because everybody did work extremely hard <,> and put in <,> a lot of effort <#> And also I think too it was it was a new project <,> for us as much as it was for the lecturers <#> And I think they had a marvellous job in their organisation skills <#> And all in all I think it was a great success <#> And I 'd like now to hand you over to Cameron <,> and he 's going to give you an insight into some <unclear> several words </unclear></I><I><S2A-029$B> <#> Thank-you <#> Uhm <&> clears throat </&> Phil 's just given you something of an insight into what the students actually experienced during the project <#> And I 'd furthermore like to go to tell you what I felt that or what they rather felt they gained from the project <#> Uh it 's true that the two weeks of the actual project itself were quite demanding <,> and a great deal of effort was required by everybody who took part <#> And from day one everybody really had to knuckle down and just get on with doing the project <#> There was no simple way around it <#> However <,> I would like to say <,> it wasn't two weeks spent for nothing <#> The project was designed in such a way as to give students a sense of vocational training <,> and to give them some <,> real-life experience and what it 'd be like to be in industry working in lab conditions and having time constraints on you and to worry about money management <,> and various other aspects of <,> life in industry <#> And inevitably this kind of project work does have many benefits to it <#> The type of project work we were doing <,> was extensive and it developed many skills I think many people never even realised they had <#> The first one was probably communication <#> On day one you arrived and you were in your randomly allocated groups <#> You didn't pick your friends and just go and work with them all day <#> You were given people <,> many people you never even met before <#> And you had to sit down and get to know them there and then and it forced you to communicate <#> There was no way around the problem <#> You had to work with these people for two weeks and you just had to talk to them <#> Uhm after the initial introductions <,> you had to get on with it <#> And this meant that for the first time there had to be a sense of group organisation <,> and perhaps more importantly management if anything successful was going to come out of your work <#> Obviously we don't live in a perfect world and arguments and personality clashes do and did arise in the project <#> However it meant that people were forced into <,> developing diplomacy and tolerance <#> Invariably projects <,> if they were going to succeed <,> required initiative <#> This was not your conventional standard spoon-fed practical you 'll find in most lab classes <#> People had to sit down and think how they were going to go about it <#> They were given the bare bones of a project <,> an outline of what was expected and the results that they were hoped that they would achieve <#> However they had to work out for themselves how they were going to get those results <#> Then <,> furthermore <,> for anything to work you were going to have to assign tasks to various people <#> There were time constraints on you something which you don't often have <,> the opportunity to experience certainly <,> in standard lab work <#> And people had to sit and think about how to efficiently use their time in the lab sessions <#> They also had to assign tasks to various members and this required a certain degree of diplomatic delegation <#> Trying to tell people who didn't want to do a job that they were best suited for it and needed to do it <#> And this meant that another important factor came into it in the form of teamwork <#> We all had to work as a team to get results <#> The actual project work itself did augment your basic practical skills <#> But it went a bit further than that because it also required a greater standard of presentation than we normally require <#> You had to present it as a poster something we never had to do before <#> You had to think about what you 're going to put in it <#> And for the first time in a practical class anyway <,> you had to think about the creativity <,> the artistic side of it <#> You had to have something that was going to catch people 's eyes and make a good impression <#> For many people this meant conquering one of their greatest fears <,> that of using computers <#> Now even in science there are many technophobes and many people had to frantically learn how to use the computer at short notice <#> And I think if you look at the posters <,> you 'll agree with me that many people did make a very good job of it <#> Uhm <,> but perhaps some of the best aspects of it were actually learning to cope with stress <,> the ongoing work of it <,> seeing how to link up small <,> interrelated practicals rather than having each this little individual bits and not seeing how they all connect in a linear fashion <#> And at the end of the day to get results from it <,> and perhaps more importantly to be able to assess the value of everybody in the group and see how they played a role <,> to look at it and to critically assess not only your own role but their role and their contribution to the groups <,> something which would be very important in industry we felt <,> in terms of assessing the effectiveness of your workforce <#> Uhm <,> it was something many people never done before and I think it was a challenge <#> They also had to take into consideration money <#> Knowing a lot of you never have to face this problem and <,> you can be a bit careless about what you 're doing <#> But when you 're suddenly faced with having to pay the bills for it you do tend to become a lot more efficient with what you 're doing <#> Uhm the pipettes don't get broken so easily <,> the beakers don't get hurled about for example <#> Not that they do normally of course <&> laughter </&> <#> Uhm <,> however uh there were some people at the end of the day were sitting trying to figure out if they could give themselves a tidy Christmas bonus at the end of it all but I don't think many people could 've managed that <#> But perhaps the greatest gift of all from the enterprise project and I would consider it a gift was actually the sense of self-confidence that developed at the end of the day <#> People were <,> in a situation where they had to communicate with one another <#> They had to communicate with people of quite <,> high importance to employers people from industry people they would never have normally talked to <#> And they had to be <,> fluent and eloquent and they had to <.> s </.> they had to bring across what they were doing and how they 'd achieved it and they had to put across in such a way as everybody could understand them <,> <#> Uhm <,> and not only that they also had to 've the confidence to work in the lab <,> to be effective <,> and to get on with it <#> And at the end of the day I think everyone would agree with me that <,> it certainly gave you confidence to achieve your own ability to its best potential <#> And at that point I 'd just like to say if anybody 's any questions on the project Lynn and I will do our best to answer them <,> <#> Thank-you <&> applause </&></I>
