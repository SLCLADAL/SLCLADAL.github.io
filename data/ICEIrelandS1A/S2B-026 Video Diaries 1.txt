<S2B-026 Video Diaries 1><I><S2B-026$A> <#> My name 's Robert Wilson <#> I live in Oxford <,> which is nice <,> if a bit dull <#> The last political murder in Oxford was two hundred and fifty years ago <,> the Oxford murder <#> However until I was nineteen I lived in Belfast <,> which is a vastly different story <#> The last political murder in Belfast was two and half days ago <#> The BBC asked me to go back <,> check it out <,> so I am going back to Belfast <,> the <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> town<&> preachers and singers in central Belfast </&><S2B-026$A> <#> I 'm conscious that Belfast serves as a startling contrast to Oxford <&> preacher in background </&> <#> In the six years that I 'd been away <,> I found I 'd moved a long way from the made-to-measure proletarian background <,> seemingly so essential for an Irish Catholic writer <&> background preachers </&> <#> The overwhelming security of places like Oxford <,> had hardened my attitude to Belfast <#> Since living in England I 'd tried my utmost to take a dim view of my hometown <,> but it 's difficult <#> Like most ex-Irishmen Belfast bewilders and seduces me in equal measure <&> preachers in background </&> <#> It was strange and exhilarating to be back in Belfast and find that so much was the same <#> The same brashness <,> the same confusion <,> the same voices competing for your ear <#> Already there seemed to be a surplus of people <,> lured by my brand new English accent <,> willing to offer me advice <#> But I confess that my first thought was to find someone willing to hold the camera every now and then <&> gives instructions to someone to operate camera </&> <#> It has to be said <,> I don't usually return to my hometown encumbered by a television camera <#> And with this in mind I felt I needed a confederate <#> My first and last choice was Glenn Patterson <,> a passing Protestant novelist<S2B-026$B> <#> When they said film people <,> I think they meant plural<S2B-026$A> <#> I had a camera <,> I had a sidekick <,> and I was back in Belfast <#> I was here to find out what I wanted from it <,> which I 'd always thought was nothing <#> Perhaps this way I could find out for sure<&> music </&><S2B-026$B> <#> You can't avoid the past <#> You can't <,> uh <.> yo </.> you can't shake it off at all <#> It 's like it 's like having sellotape stuck to your hand you know <#> You pull it off and it sticks to the other hand <#> And the more you keep pulling at it and working with it the muckier it gets<&> music </&><S2B-026$A> <#> One of the exciting things I did on this trip <,> was to meet my father for the first time in fifteen years <#> Here he is <&> father greets camera </&> <#> Uh <,> and since he 's my dad <,> he 's invited me to come stay with him for a few days <,> here on the Falls Road <#> Look at those steady hands on that wheel <#> Look at those nicotine stains whoa <&> music </&> <#> I 'd only been back in Belfast a few days <,> and it was already tempting to see myself in the role of the dissident Catholic <#> The problem is that too many people would endorse this view <#> When the world thinks of an Irishman <,> it thinks of a Catholic <,> but there are these things called Irish Protestants who 've been here for four hundred years <#> Glenn Patterson <,> successful novelist and Presbyterian <,> hasn't been here that long but he can still teach me something about Irishness<S2B-026$B> <#> What 's important is actually working out what it is to be from here <,> and to work to work through that <#> I don't know what to call myself <#> This is one of my my great problems <#> I never know what to call I know I know my name <,> but I I never know whether to call myself <,> Northern Irish <#> I I it 's it 's a crisis of you don't know how to even say the name of where you come from <#> Uh everything is everything is so heavily <,> imbued with significance <#> If you say the North of Ireland you know people have got this peculiar sense of hearing <#> They can they can get all the political affiliations just from what you call the country <#> I mean the Six Counties is an obvious one <#> Ulster is the other obvious one <#> This is uh Wedderburn Park where I <,> grew up <#> And in here on the right <,> is <,> a most famous local amenity <,> which is the crazy golf course <#> You could only actually hit it <,> you 'd only <.> h </.> had one go at each hole <&> laughter </&> <#> And then after that that was it <,> you were back at the beginning again <,> which is uhm <,> heavily symbolic <#> It 's a curious thing this question of belonging <#> Whenever I 'm here <,> I 'm desperate to get away <#> And whenever I 'm over there in Manchester I 'm desperate to get back to Belfast <#> I swear sometimes I think the only time I 'm truly happy <,> is when I 'm in the plane <,> that one hour in between <#> Turf Lodge is that way<S2B-026$A> <#> Turf Lodge is where I grew up <#> It 's a mile and a half from where Glenn lived <,> but he 's never been there<S2B-026$B> <#> You can see it from the bedroom window <#> Shall we go and look through the <,> square window <#> This is uh twelfth of July nineteen seventy-five in Belfast <,> and appearing here that 's me <,> walking in my one and only Twelfth of July <,> which my mum swears I was paid ten shillings to do <,> and I wish I could remember <,> that I that I was paid that that I I think I may just 've done it cos I wanted to <#> And now you 'll see what I was doing whenever Robert was out <,> throwing stones<S2B-026$A> <#> Actually <,> it 's unfair to say that I was throwing stones <#> We searched the BBC archives and as you can see <,> I was merely observing<S2B-026$B> <#> It 's hard it 's hard actually to to think of what stage you <,> you know I was fifteen fourteen coming on <.> fi </.> fourteen thirteen fourteen at that time <,> and <,> it 's hard to know when <,> when you started <,> coming out of that <,> or how you how you <,> dissociate yourself from it <,> or how you didn't become uhm <,> you know how it didn't become the focal point of your life <#> I think really the only thing is is just luck <#> I actually was in this band for a stage but I was a <,> I was crap <#> I was a dummy fluter <#> I was a dummy Irish dummy dummy Irishman and a dummy Orangeman <&> laughs </&> and a dummy Irishman and a dummy bloody Englishman as well <#> This is uh here you see <,> the problem you know we 're nothing <#> You <,> completely know where you belong out here <#> I don't know <&> laughs </&><&> brief news reports </&><S2B-026$A> <#> I 'd now been back a week and I was getting depressed by the enormity of what I 'd taken on <#> Already I didn't know where I was <&> scene changes </&> <#> I 'm so depressed <#> God I 'm happy <#> And I just want to go home <#> I just want to stop now <#> God I 'm happy <#> I feel real shame <#> I am completely elated <,> and I can't take any more of Belfast <#> I 'm in Belfast <,> and I want to be <#> I nearly got arrested again today <#> It 's unbelievable <#> This is our house on the Falls Road <#> My Da actually and has two bathrooms <#> I wish I 'd never taken this on <&> background family members talking </&> <#> Actually I did know where I was <#> I knew exactly where I was <#> On the Falls Road with the Wilson Clan <&> background speakers </&> <#> I have to say it wasn't really helping <#> They seemed to regard the whole thing as a bit of a joke <,> Robert messing around with his camera <&> family laughing and joking </&> <#> I think they found it difficult to understand that this strange lost relative of theirs <,> was undergoing so much difficulty in trying to define the Falls Road <,> an area so familiar to them <,> and surprisingly so free of significance <&> laughter and talking </&> <#> I suppose I 'd moved a long way from West Belfast <#> I 'd certainly forgotten a hell of a lot <#> I was bringing anglicised Oxbridge notions to bear on a place which England has never really understood <#> I was even feeling all the sweaty unease of a Troubles virgin <,> in the very area which I could by rights describe as my home <#> However I hadn't been away so long that the prevalent atmosphere of suspicion <,> fear and constant surveillance <,> didn't quickly revive a few memories <,> and produce one or two new ideas for good or ill <#> One of the things that the liberal British find most difficult to understand about a place like the Falls Road <,> is the attitude to the police and the army <#> The attitude seems to be one of unmixed hatred and resentment <&> shout from background </&> <&> laughs </&> <#> But what you got to understand <,> is that the police and the army <,> are not a force of law and order for the Falls Road <#> They 're a force of law and order against the Falls Road <#> They police against this community <#> And it 's difficult to feel anything else but resentment <,> when it is like that <#> I mean I myself was beaten up just here <,> yup just there <,> when I was sixteen walking up to the Royal for physiotherapy on crutches <,> in my school uniform and a foot patrol still kicked the crap out of me <#> I mean it really is hard <#> It 's hard not to let that piss you off <#> So this attitude <,> if not excusable is at least comprehensible <#> And since the Anglo-Irish Agreement <,> Protestant communities <,> such as this one in Sandy Row <,> traditionally supporters of the security forces <,> no longer feel that the police and the army operate in their favour either <#> The resulting mixture of resentment and betrayal in the Loyalist community <,> has changed the political temperature of Northern Ireland <#> There are no longer only the two well-known divided societies <,> Protestant and Catholic <#> There is now a third <,> equally isolated and equally self-protecting <,> the security forces themselves<S2B-026$?> <#> Who are you filming for<S2B-026$A> <#> One of the largest outlets for public expenditure in the Province and one of the country 's largest employers <,> the third of the three<&> speaks to police about filming </&><&> music </&><S2B-026$A> <#> When I was sixteen <,> I was kicked out of home for going out with a Protestant girl <#> I learnt then that social workers really run the twentieth-century city <#> John Growcot <,> was a social worker who saved my particular bacon <#> He 's well qualified to talk about the substance of Belfast<S2B-026$C> <#> One of the features of Belfast I think <,> as someone who 's lived here all my life <,> is that deprivation is very localised <,> and it 's rooted <#> West Belfast for example has major problems <,> major problems in terms of unemployment major problems in terms of property <#> In the east of the city <,> there are pockets of deprivation <#> But there are large parts of the city <,> remarkably <,> which are untouched effectively by the Troubles <,> and which are untouched <,> by the deprivation which is so much a feature of those other areas <#> And I think people <,> Belfast as a city has a vibrancy <,> has a life <#> Its poorest its most deprived people have an integrity <,> which enables them <,> to move through the difficulties <,> in a way which is remarkable <#> At a broader level <,> I think Belfast simply reflects how society as a whole deals with inequalities <&> background speaker </&> <#> I would see Belfast perhaps as different <#> I wouldn't wish to say more difficult <,> more as different <#> And it 's different because of the unique problems which we have <#> And those problems are essentially the historical realities of sectarianism <,> and the historical divisions within our society <&> traffic noise </&> <#> Social services would tend to become involved where families <,> are suffering as a direct consequence of their location in terms of communal disputes <&> traffic noise </&> <#> Just across from the office here actually is Manor Street <,> which is one of the sectarian front line divides <#> In July eighty-seven <,> there was a major <.> sect </.> <,> there was a major outburst of sectarian violence across that peace line which necessitated the moving out of a number of families <#> It 's a difficult area <#> People in both sides of that interface face major difficulties <,> dreadful difficulties with at times nightly rioting between youths from both areas <#> Now social services <,> have really very little to offer because the resource which those people desperately need is housing <,> but housing is such a scarce priority <,> compounded by the fact that people very much wish to remain within their own communities and exhaust available stock within those communities</I>
