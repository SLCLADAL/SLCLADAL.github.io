<S2B-048 Socialist politics><I><S2B-048$A> <#> Comrades <,,> friends <,> international guests <,> I <,> am a socialist <,> and I have news for those <,> who want to bury socialism <&> applause </&> <#> There is no <,> corpse for their coffin <&> applause </&> <#> Socialism is alive <,> and it dwells in the hearts of people <#> It survives as the hope for a better life <#> It 's the heart of our heartless world <#> But my intention tonight <,> is not <,> to comfort you with soothing phrases <#> It 's to challenge you to greater effort <,> to greater commitment in a proud cause <,,> <#> I no more than anyone else this time last year <,> predicted that the year ahead of us would be so remarkable <#> The Berlin Wall fell <,,> and the Iron Curtain <,> of tanks and missiles was redundant <#> But even before those extraordinary events <,> we notched up our own historic breakthrough <#> We won seven seats in the Da/il and our first seat in the European Parliament <#> In my speech at last year 's A/rd Fheis <,> I urged you to look searchingly at some sacred cows <#> And I know I shocked you <,> with what I said about socialism <#> And I asked you to <.> bate </.> those arguments <,> and you took me at my word <#> And indeed that speech itself <,> has now been <,> reinterpreted let 's say in the afterglow of what has happened in the east <#> There are now those who argue that the Workers ' Party must ditch <,> some of its socialist values if it 's not to be <,> put onto the margins of Irish politics <#> We are told that it was only my speech last year that brought about our electoral victories <,> and comrades to believe that <,> would not only be a self-delusion <,> but it would be a denial of your work <,> your commitment <,> the work that you have put into this party all over these long years knocking on doors campaigning and winning support for this party <&> applause </&> <#> It is your party and your victory <&> applause </&> <#> It is also a denial <,> of the capacity of people <,> the people out there who we are trying to win <#> It 's a denial of their capacity to make free choices <,> to make up their minds about what packaged material is being offered to them <,> and to make clear intelligent choices and not be swayed by the latest sensation <#> It was your dedication over the years that brought us our victories <#> Those victories were the result of hundreds <,> of small achievements that were won over many weeks many months and many years <#> They were won by you <,> our supporters and friends who have cast their lot with us in the battle for a better future <#> Our strength lies with you and the work you do <,> and indeed <,> in the <,> commitment and integrity of the party and the belief of the people in the integrity of the party <#> Socialists of course are optimists <#> We tend to see the bottle <,> half full instead of half empty <#> Despite all the difficulties we see the marvellous opportunities there are <,> to give new meaning and substance to our struggles <#> Socialism lives despite Stalinism and despite Thatcherism <#> It 's an ideal that cannot be defeated because it it is an idea that is central to the human experience an aspiration to justice to freedom from oppression and exploitation <,> and it has flowered in the darkest hours of history <,> in every part of the world <#> There is no need deeper <,> no desire stronger than that that cries out for a world that is based on respect for human values <,> for equity for work co-operation and sharing among the citizens <,> in every society under every form of repression the seed of this idea has taken root <#> Again and again it has struggled into the light of day <#> And the expression <,> of that idea <,> is a commitment to socialist politics <#> Do the would-be gravediggers of socialism <,> Bush <,> and Thatcher and let us not forget our own <,> Mr Haughey who is at this point in time parading around the world stage <,> in his borrowed presidential robes <,> telling us how the West has won <#> Can they truly imagine that their petty vulgar views of the world have prevailed <#> A world where greed is god <#> The seedy carpetbaggers who are now swarming across the face of Eastern Europe <,> like all the political barbarians before them <,> are hunting for their own advantage <#> They have no grasp of what has gone before <,> no idea of the massive suffering and sacrifice of millions <,> no conception of the colossal efforts of each age in turn <,> to take one step closer <,> to human liberation <#> It is true <,> that the collapse of communist regimes <,> and the radical reassessment of socialist society in history <,> has dealt a mortal blow to those who gave blind uncritical support to the Eastern bloc <#> And let me say it is a valid criticism of our party <,> that we did not more publicly criticise the defects we saw in communist countries <#> But it would be totally unprincipled to join the chorus that uses the collapse of communist regimes to assist those who are trying to deny the need for an alternative to the inhuman capitalist system <&> applause </&> <#> It 's a system <,> which treats the human being and the labour of <.> humbin </.> human beings and the resources of this earth as simply raw <.> mate </.> <.> terials </.> for their own <,> profit and power <#> The big risk of our current preoccupations is <,> that as the continent of Europe <,> enters a period of political change unprecedented since the First World War <,> that we will turn inwards on ourselves <,> towards a greater European chauvinism <,> which turns its back on the people <,> of Africa <,> of Asia and of Latin America <,> <#> If already inadequate amounts of Third aid Third World aid and are are <.> c </.> cut to meet the needs of the states in eastern Europe <,> then the new dawn in Europe <,> will come to represent a nightmare <,> for the majority of the people on this planet <#> Aid and development for the Third World have to be at the centre of the concerns of a broadly progressive European politics <#> For we must realise <,> that what demonstrates most powerfully the conflict between uncontrolled market forces and a decent sustainable existence for all the people of the world is the treadmill of low prices <,> for primary commodities with for massive debt and the poverty of the peoples of the Third World <#> That is the conflict which is basic to the difference between socialism and capitalism <#> No <,> socialism is not dead <#> What has died is pseudo-socialism because it lacked the essential component of democracy <#> Stalinism is dead <#> Systems imposed on unwilling people <,> who have never been consulted are dead too <#> And anyone who feels that that type of pseudo-socialism <,> can be revived by its pretending to be something else for a while and re-emerging from the ashes like a phoenix <,> is dead from the neck up <#> What we have seen happening in eastern Europe <,> has been an upsurge of the popular will <#> We have seen the people take power <,> from the entrenched and corrupt bureaucrats <,> who thought that there could be socialism without democracy <,> who thought that they knew better than the people what was good for them <#> What we have been privileged to witness <,> is the birth of a realisation <,> by ordinary working people <,> that they are the real possessors of power <,> if they would but use it <#> It is not just Eastern Europe that has seen great political change in the past year <#> Nowhere has the change been more dramatic or more welcome than in South Africa <,> where it is now clear that we are witnessing the beginning of the end <,> of the vile and detested apartheid system <#> Nelson Mandela is free from his conventional prison and soon <,> the people of South Africa will be free from the prison of apartheid <&> applause </&> <#> And let me say <,> that for all the flaws and there are many <,> of the East European states <,> they have proved more responsive to popular pressure <,> than many of the states that trumpet their support for the values of the free market <#> South Africa is a free market <,> which has not prevented but in fact is part of the appalling oppression of the vast majority of the people there <#> Tens of thousands of people have been jailed or killed in central America by regimes <,> who claim to be free market regimes <#> In El Salvador <,> which tolerates no dissent <,> and who are lavishly financed and supported by the <.> Unite </.> <.> nited </.> States <#> But the one beacon of hope <,> in that region has been Nicaragua <#> The Sandinista <.> reg </.> revolution <,> in Nicaragua <,> was a brave experiment <,> which was massively popular <,> and which brought significant improvements to the social and economic conditions of the people of Nicaragua <#> It was we know <,> brought to the verge of collapse by sustained military and economic pressure from the United States <#> But the Sandinistas have proved their democratic credentials <#> They have handed over power to the victors in the election recently held in Nicaragua <#> But they will be back <#> The people will win once more in Nicaragua and we will give them all the help that we can give them to do that <&> applause </&> <#> The lesson <,> for our age <,> is that socialism <,> if it is to succeed <,> must have democracy as its essence <#> It must base itself first of all on the primary needs of human beings <,> the need for peace and security <,> for a caring society <,> and for a careful economy <#> It must have as its primary aim <,> the development of forms of production which no longer regards human beings and the world merely as raw materials to be exploited <,> and which no longer simply fills needs only if there is a profit to be made out of it for someone <#> In Haughey 's Ireland <,> as in Thatcher 's Britain <,> healthcare is a market commodity <#> If you don't have the money <,> you don't get the service <#> If you do have the money <,> you can have all the treatment you want <,> and indeed in the lap of luxury if you choose to have it <#> Education <,> is a market commodity <#> This means that if you have the money <,> you can buy the best education for your children <#> It means if you don't have the money <,> then your children will get a barely adequate education <,> and they will remain poor <,> unless they are lucky <,> or if they are brilliant <#> Now treating services like these <,> as market commodities leads inevitably <,> to permanent disadvantage <#> And that is something the marketeers can live with <,> but it 's something we cannot live with <,> and we won't live with it <&> applause </&> <#> When the market is not <,> under democratic control <,> it <.> inevit </.> <.> evitably </.> controls politics <#> It will dictate to people how they live <,> and where they can live <#> It will dictate their access to learning <,> their access to healthcare <,> and indeed even their access to culture <#> There are many everyday examples <,> of political and popular issues being turned into mere market commodities <#> The most recent example <,> is the greening of business <#> The advertising agencies have discovered <,> that for business <,> green is good <#> So every possible product and retail outlet is been being presented in the greenest possible light <#> Even British Nuclear Fuels <,> <&> laughter </&> have spent twenty million pounds <,> to tell us <,> that this is really the alternative <,> to global warming <,> <#> So <,> how else do we can we see the effects of this green being good for business <#> Have you seen your shelves in the supermarkets lately <#> They are stacked with products for which spurious claims are being made <,> about preservatives <,> about artificial colourings and about what and about CFCs <#> What is <.> uh </.> urgently needed is a statutory system of labelling <,> so that the consumer can be sure that the claims being made are not bogus <#> Bogus green labelling of course is not confined to the supermarket shelf <#> It is also to be found in political life <#> Some parties have now found <,> a new green flag <,> to wrap around their jaded politics <#> While Fianna Fa/il Councillors <,> are busy abusing their powers <,> re-zoning and destroying greenbelts <,> and while the European Parliament is taking twenty-one actions against the Irish Government for failure to implement environmental <.> reg </.> regulations <,> what does our Taoiseach do <#> He markets himself as the Green President of Europe <#> Clearly a case <,> of bogus labelling <&> laughter </&> <&> applause </&> <#> But despite all the hype about the environment <,> it has been the Workers ' Party <,> often acting alone which has exposed the Government 's hypocrisy on this issue</I>
