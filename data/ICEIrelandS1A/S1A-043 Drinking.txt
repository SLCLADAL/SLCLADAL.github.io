holidays or when she 's she 's you know she goes away <#> Like uh I was telling you about Violet and and Mark Conyngham took her in the wheelchair up to <{1> <[1> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[1> <#> Aye <{2> <[2> well </[2> I was saying I <{3> <[3> was saying to Tim </[3><S1A-043$B> <#> <[1> Oh Christ aye </[1> </{1><S1A-043$B> <#> <[2> Kraut </[2> </{2><S1A-043$B> <#> <[3> Have you heard </[3> </{3> that story<S1A-043$C> <#> No<S1A-043$A> <#> I was saying to Tim I says well what about them <#> He says I heard <#> He says Jackie phoned me last week <#> He says Mary got drunk <#> Now she only ever uh ever ever gets drunk when she goes on holidays <#> And she <&> laughter </&> she goes on holidays<S1A-043$C> <#> Just like you Mary <&> laughter </&><S1A-043$A> <#> She 's too scared <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> <#> So he says she she got drunk on Saint Patrick 's night <#> We painted her face green <&> laughter </&> <#> And she was sitting in this bar with this paint <&> laughter </&> <#> I says cos <#> This is Paul Duke 's sister and her and her and her her brother-in-law<S1A-043$D> <#> Oh right<S1A-043$A> <#> And and thingy <#> But Mary went away God rest Lilly <#> Lilly would 've been my best friend <#> And before Lilly died <,> two years ago I mean she she started it was just the the start of her being really ill <,> and they went to Lourdes <#> And Lilly and Mary <,> and it was <,> Paul 's brother uh <,> <.> Bo </.> uh Bob was running the trip to Lourdes <#> And Bob would be very uh <,> what would you say Bob would <{1> <[1> be </[1> <,> pious <#> Bob would <{2> <[2> be very pious </[2> <#> And <{3> <[3> he does </[3><S1A-043$B> <#> <[1> Pious </[1> </{1><S1A-043$D> <#> <[2> Oh right </[2> </{2><S1A-043$B> <#> <[3> That 's Bob </[3> </{3> I always think now<S1A-043$A> <#> Bob Bob wouldn't drink and he doesn't smoke <{1> <[1> and </[1> he 'd maybe go to Mass twice a day <#> And Bob would and <&> laughter </&> all the rest of the Dukes would be <{2> <[2> <,> would maybe </[2> be a wee bit sort of would enjoy their drink and would be full of the devilment <#> So Lilly anyway went but she wasn't feeling great so she didn't go out of her hotel all that that much <#> Mary the next sister up Mary would only ever really take enjoy a drink when she would go away on holidays like that <&> laughter </&> <#> So <.> Ma </.> Mary had been up at the <{3> <[3> the Grotto </[3> Mary had been up at the Grotto <{4> <[4> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[4> done her done her praying done her thingy and come back and done aye exactly and got pissed <&> laughter </&> <#> So <.> Vi </.> Violet next door and big Sam across the street anyway decided that they would go up to the grotto that night and Mary was really that drunk that she couldn't walk <#> So they put Mary into a wheelchair <&> laughter </&><S1A-043$D> <#> <[1> Uh-huh </[1> </{1><S1A-043$D> <#> <[2> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[2> </{2><S1A-043$D> <#> <[3> At Lourdes </[3> </{3> <&> laughter </&><S1A-043$D> <#> <[4> Where 's the nearest pub </[4> </{4><S1A-043$B> <#> Can you see where this story 's going<S1A-043$A> <#> So aye they were pushing Mary up the hill and Mary was really well on <#> And they were pushing up pushing that way and this was well on at night anyway <#> So the the entrance into the bottom of the grotto was locked so they had to push her up to the top up up this hill up to the top of the grotto right<S1A-043$C> <#> To the grotto <&> laughter </&><S1A-043$A> <#> So right <{> <[> right </[><S1A-043$B> <#> <[> Wait til </[> </{> you hear<S1A-043$A> <#> So Sam Violet said that won't take us <#> You pull her <#> Devilment <#> So they were pushing Mary up but Mary was really well pissed <#> And as I say Bobby is so <,> really pious <#> So they they didn't <,> count on meeting Bobby <#> They thought Bobby would 've had all his praying done <&> laughter </&> <#> So the next thing to came out of the side gate was Bobby you see <#> And Mary looked up and says oh Jesus Christ there 's our Bobby coming <#> And Violet says <,> Mary sit there and don't don't open your mouth <#> We 'll do the talking for you you see <#> For Violet and Sam weren't as pissed as <{> <[> Mary you see </[><S1A-043$C> <#> <[> Are they all </[> </{> sisters and <{> <[> brother </[><S1A-043$A> <#> <[> Well </[> </{> Violet 's my next door neighbour right<S1A-043$C> <#> Violet 's your next door neighbour <#> <{> <[> Yes yes yes </[><S1A-043$A> <#> <[> Right </[> </{> <#> Sam <.> Co </.> Conyngham who lives over a few doors <#> Lilly lived over there <,> and Mary <#> So Mary and Lilly were two two sisters and Bobby was Lilly 's twin <{1> <[1> brother </[1> <#> And Bobby was organising it <,> the thingy and Bobby 's the one that doesn't drink <#> So and he frowns very very badly on anybody that got drunk and smoking sort of <#> So Violet says we 'll push you up this hill anyway <#> And and and the next thing that came out of the gate was Bridie and Bobby <#> And Violet says oh Jesus Christ <,> Mary there 's your Bobby <#> And Mary says oh dear God <#> Violet says Mary sit there and don't don't open your mouth <#> We 'll do the talking for to <,> for you 're too drunk <#> Don't you bother open your mouth <#> So he came out and he says <,> Mary <,> what are you doing in that wheelchair <#> And Violet says och her legs was sore <#> We decided she wants to do a wee bit of praying and we decided to push her <&> laughter </&> <#> So Mary Mary never says a a word you see <#> And Bobby looked at her very suspiciously anyway and went on down the hill <#> So they pushed her up round and into the grotto and into where the fountains was <#> So when I the minute Mary got in you see she was grand <#> She got up out of the the chair and went into the fountain <#> And all these German and French <&> laughter </&> <{2> <[2> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[2> started shouting it 's a miracle <#> And everybody came over clapped hands <&> laughter </&> <#> I says Mary I 'm affronted <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> There 's no cause for affront <,> she says <unclear> 2 syllables </unclear> <#> So she only she only ever gets drunk when she goes <{3> <[3> on holiday </[3><S1A-043$C> <#> <[1> Right </[1> </{1><S1A-043$B> <#> <[2> It 's a miracle </[2> </{2><S1A-043$D> <#> <[3> What did she </[3> </{3> do then<S1A-043$A> <#> She got back into the wheelchair and <&> laughter </&> they pushed her back down the hill <,> pushed her back back down to the hotel <#> And uh Tim was saying now I was talking to Tim what was the day I says well Tim I says what about them I says have you any heard any word <#> She says he says I heard Mary got drunk this time again he says <#> And they painted her face green this time he says <#> Bet they all had a good laugh <#> He says she woke up and she 'd this big green <&> laughter </&> Saint Patrick 's Day face on her <#> I said you 're a terrible man
