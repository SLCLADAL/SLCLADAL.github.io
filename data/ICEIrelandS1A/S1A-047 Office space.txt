fairly </[> </{> late by the hour<S1A-047$A> <#> Yeah <,> and you see <,> Israel and getting a visa<S1A-047$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-047$A> <#> You know <{> <[> and </[> I have a visa for Damascus on my visa so I don't know if<S1A-047$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-047$B> <#> Well yeah <,> it 's it 's a group <,> you don't need a visa for Israel <,> you <{1> <[1> need a visa for Jordan </[1> <,> yes <,> and a group visa does if they have more than twenty people <,> cos I was supposed to be going <{2> <[2> last </[2> Christmas <,> yes <,> yeah yeah <,> and then the <{3> <[3> friend </[3> I was going with <,> her sister had to be <,> her sister died <{4> <[4> so </[4> it was cancelled and uhm <,> but we were travelling on a group visa cos we were more than twenty <{5> <[5> people </[5> to Jordan and <{6> <[6> you don't need one </[6> for <{7> <[7> Israel </[7> but you just have to see to it I think that the Israelis don't stamp your passport<S1A-047$A> <#> <[1> Need a visa for Jordan </[1> </{1><S1A-047$A> <#> <[2> Really mm </[2> </{2><S1A-047$A> <#> <[3> Mm </[3> </{3><S1A-047$A> <#> <[4> Mm </[4> </{4><S1A-047$A> <#> <[5> Right </[5> </{5><S1A-047$A> <#> <[6> Oh I see

suppose once I saw that this was there that I could go on <{1> <[1> it </[1> then I began to think look I won't go <{2> <[2> anywhere <,> </[2> <#> And I also looked into Tenerife <#> I 'd like <{3> <[3> to go </[3> so <#> For just go somewhere <#> <{4> <[4> And I </[4> began to think maybe I shouldn't bother spending all that much money because I think <,> I have neglected I used to do Spanish last <{5> <[5> year </[5> <,> and I thought maybe if I spent one month in Spain next summer <{6> <[6> <,> doing an intensive course </[6> because I 've had to give up <#> I haven't time to do Spanish this term <,> <#> It was too intensive and we had too much <{7> <[7> homework <,> </[7> <#> So I just couldn't do it at all<S1A-047$B> <#> <[1> Right </[1> </{1><S1A-047$B> <#> <[2> Yes </[2> </{2><S1A-047$B> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1A-047$B> <#> <[4> Right yeah </[4> </{4><S1A-047$B> <#> <[5> Yes </[5> </{5><S1A-047$B> <#> <[6> Yeah <,> yeah yeah </[6> </{6><S1A-047$B> <#> <[7> Yes </[7> </{7><S1A-047$B> <#> Yeah <#> What tour operator was offering that<S1A-047$A> <#> Spanish <{1> <[1> Spain <#> Oh sorry the Jerusalem </[1> <#> Uhm it was in the Guardian so it was actually it looked like two girls <#> <{2> <[2> There were names that in London <#> So people in London </[2><S1A-047$B> <#> <[1> No no the yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-047$B> <#> <[2> Oh I see <#> Ah yes <#> Ah yes I see <#> Yeah </[2> </{2> I see <#> Yes yeah <#> <{> <[> So that 's </[><S1A-047$A> <#> <[> Well as </[> </{> I say just because it was there I thought <{1> <[1> well I would go if mother <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> would </[1> <#> But I thought it was <{2> <[2> lovely the idea of it but I 'd never get anyone to go with me </[2><S1A-047$B> <#> <[1> Right <#> Ah yes I know yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-047$B> <#> <[2> Yeah yeah yes I was yes I </[2> </{2> was looking forward to going now last Christmas and I thought <{> <[> it would be </[> really very very interesting<S1A-047$A> <#> <[>
