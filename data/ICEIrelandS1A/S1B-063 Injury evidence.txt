Harold McBrinn My Lord<S1B-063$C> <#> Yes you may be seated Mr McBrinn<S1B-063$D> <#> Mr McBrinn would you just state your occupation and your qualifications to My Lord<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes uh I I 'm a chartered engineer My Lord<S1B-063$D> <#> Now can you tell My Lord at the request of Messrs Quinn and Macmillan the plaintiff 's solicitors did you uh visit the Springfield Road in Belfast on the eighth of November nineteen ninety-nine<S1B-063$A> <#> That 's correct My Lord<S1B-063$D> <#> And can you tell My Lord <,> did you go alone or did anyone go with you<S1B-063$A> <#> Uh no I was on my own <#> Uh I I called with the uh plaintiff but uh her mother informed me that she was ill at the time and could not attend<S1B-063$D> <#> And did you have anything uh with you to indicate the uh locus where you were to carry out your inspection<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes I used uh Mr Ridley 's black and white photographs uh to uh identify the uh location<S1B-063$D> <#> And did you go to the part of the Springfield Road then shown in those three black and white photographs<S1B-063$A> <#> That 's correct<S1B-063$D> <#> Can you tell My Lord <,> uh did you uh locate the uh depression shown in the uh first of the black and white photographs<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes the one with the rules in it yes<S1B-063$D> <#> And can you tell me now did you measure the length width and depth of that depression<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes it 's uhm <,> it it it obviously <,> it it dishes up and down so it 's uh seven to eight inches long <,> five to six inches wide and I measured the uh depth of the depression with a probe and measured it as an inch deep <,><S1B-063$D> <#> And uh <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> evidence from the photographs but what what part of the footpath was it in in terms of uh location on the footpath<S1B-063$A> <#> Central<S1B-063$D> <#> And uh what kind of uh location is this <,> uh the Springfield Road<S1B-063$A> <#> The Springfield Road would be uhm a fairly uh heavily pedestrianised area <#> It would take a lot of pedestrian traffic down into the town<S1B-063$D> <#> Now can you say anything to My Lord in relation to the nature of the depression depression in terms of how visible or otherwise it is as one walks along<S1B-063$A> <#> Well it 's <,> it 's <,> it depends on really the lighting conditions the the you know if it 's a dull day or whatever it is <#> But I mean it is the same <,> basically the same colour as the surrounding asphalt <#> Uh so it uh <,> it wouldn't be uh <,> you know it 's <,> if you 're looking directly at it <,> as with anything you 'll see it <#> But if you 're depending on your peripheral vision which is uh what most people do <,> then it 's difficult to pick up detail <#> Peripheral vision tends to pick at best a a <,> a difference in colour<S1B-063$D> <#> And would you uh have anything to say to My Lord in terms of the effect of this depression for pedestrians walking along the footpath<S1B-063$A> <#> Well it is <,> it is a a a sizeable uh depression <#> It 's uh <,> at its deepest point it I mean it will <,> because of the the the situation of the depression it will tend to fill up sort of seasonally and down with mud so it becomes uh uh visually sort of different and a as maybe days change <#> Uhm but if there 's just soft mud at the bottom of it it could be even more deceptive because the heel will just go straight through it <,> or the or the toe will go straight through it <#> So in my view yes it would be a hazard to pedestrians<S1B-063$D> <#> Now <,> Miss <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> described to My Lord that uh her heel or the heel of her shoe which she described to be heeled on a platform uh <{> <[> so </[> that the heel of that went into the depression<S1B-063$A> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><S1B-063$A> <#> Yes<S1B-063$D> <#> Uhm <,> is it the sort of depression that would uhm encompass or capture the the heel in the way she described<S1B-063$A> <#> Well there is a difference in level of a as I measure it at its deepest point an inch <,> looking at Mr Ridley 's photograph it appears to be more like just over three quarters of an inch <#> Uhm I mean that would be enough to arrest any uh approaching foot<S1B-063$D> <#> Could you uh form any impression in remembering June ninety-nine as to whether this was something which had just happened or something which had been there <#> I appreciate your just having the black and white photographs<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes<S1B-063$B> <#> In June nineteen ninety-nine<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes <#> Well <,> uhm I would have uh <,> I 'd be of the impression that this is actually not something which has come about due to wear and tear <#> Uhm the general surface of the asphalt in that area uh is uhm <,> is quite rough uh uh <,> not the type of smooth surface you would tend to get with a well rolled impacted surface <#> And uh in my opinion the probably the most likely uhm uh situation is that this depression occurred very shortly after the asphalt was laid <,> in fact probably uhm within even hours or or certainly days of the asphalt laying and uh that type of depression can come about uhm due to air pockets being left in the asphalt<S1B-063$C> <#> Sorry due to what <,> <{> <[> air pockets </[><S1B-063$A> <#> <[> Air pockets </[> </{> <#> If you <,> if you 're putting a batch of asphalt out on a footpath and then you put another batch out on on on a <.> j </.> on like and making a a momentary joint like a few minutes later or maybe you know if there isn't enough asphalt to complete the patch and you get some more in <,> what you can do is you can actually form an air <.> po </.> air pocket in around that and uh the uhm the three sort of uh defects which were referred to before if you notice are in a line across the footpath <#> And uh that would indicate to me<S1B-063$C> <#> I 'm sorry what did you say<S1B-063$A> <#> They they appear to be in a line across the footpath<S1B-063$C> <#> There there are other similar ones across the <{> <[> footpath </[><S1B-063$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> there <,> well there there there are uh lesser uh sort of depressions on the footpath<S1B-063$D> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> Are you taking that from these photographs<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes <,><S1B-063$C> <#> Well from the and I appreciate you 're going on the photographs and then seeing it <{> <[> some </[> short time later <,> how long would it have been there approximately<S1B-063$A> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><S1B-063$A> <#> I would say it has been there uhm from in around the time the asphalt was laid <#> Uh<S1B-063$C> <#> Yes well leaving that aside <#> When would that have been approximately <#> In case there 's <,> there may be evidence<S1B-063$A> <#> Several <,> several <{> <[> years uh </[> My Lord <#> I can't say with any sort of exactness but several years I would suggest <,> <#> It 's not a typical wear and tear type depression<S1B-063$C> <#> <[> Several years </[> </{><S1B-063$C> <#> Yes <#> I 've noted you said that <#> Well does it get progressively worse as time passes<S1B-063$A> <#> That to me wouldn't <,> I would say that that depression formed uh<S1B-063$C> <#> Within hours or days would you say<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes within hours or <,> I would favour hours nearly more than days <#> It 's the sort of depression which comes if an air pocket if the asphalt is still hot <,> it will collapse<S1B-063$C> <#> Yes that 's what I thought you were going to say<S1B-063$D> <#> If one wanted to repair that defect that 's shown in the black and white photograph and in <unclear> several sylls </unclear> photograph<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes<S1B-063$D> <#> What what 's involved in repairing that<S1B-063$A> <#> Uhm it 's basically <,> uh the the proper way to repair it is to cut out a a rectangle around it to give a good key of asphalt uhm around it and then uh basically prime the edge of the the cut out hole and uh re-lay the asphalt <#> Uh you would only need say a foot square or a foot by eight inches <,> something like that to <,> to uh <,> it 's quite isolated the the the fault so it would be really a a very short-time job for an asphalt crew<S1B-063$D> <#> Thank-you<S1B-063$E> <#> Mr McBrinn I think you said you were out in November nineteen ninety-nine <#> Is that right<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes <#> Uhm I was out on the eighth of November nineteen ninety-nine<S1B-063$E> <#> Five months or so after Mr Ridley was out <#> Is that right<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes I believe he was out on the fifteenth of June nineteen ninety-nine<S1B-063$E> <#> And uhm I think you said that you thought Mr Ridley 's photographs appeared to show something about three quarters of an inch or thereabouts<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes<S1B-063$E> <#> And uhm <,> did you look at exactly the same<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes<S1B-063$E> <#> Depression <#> Uhm and uhm if you were saying that perhaps it was in inch <,> there may not be very much in it one way or the other <,> but you were saying about an inch<S1B-063$A> <#> Yeah well what you 'll get is you 'll find that the <,> the <,> the bottom of the <,> as you can see in Mr Ridley 's photographs that the mud will gather and that will either uh build up or clear out as <,> seasonally <#> So uh basically what I did just to to test the full depth was just to put a probe down<S1B-063$E> <#> Was that into the mud<S1B-063$A> <#> Into the mud yes<S1B-063$E> <#> So that would account for the perhaps the discrepancy between the two<S1B-063$A> <#> Oh yes I mean you can get a discrepancy seasonally and it could be less than Mr Ridley 's or it could be more<S1B-063$E> <#> And uhm the <,> as far as width is concerned uh <,> it appears to be uh a nine or ten inch horizontal rule <#> It appears to be something in the region of what <,> eight or nine inches across<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes <#> Unfortunately I don't have the black and white photographs in front of me so I <,> thank-you <,> <#> Yes <#> I mean if you look at the horizontal rule on the right-hand side <,> it 's about seven and a half inches and on the left-hand side <,> maybe one and a half to two inches <#> It dishes down at that point<S1B-063$E> <#> And as you use the the word yourself it is <,> it uh forms a dish or a shape of a dish<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes <#> Most most depressions are<S1B-063$E> <#> And it would be in the uh shape of a dish both directions<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes<S1B-063$E> <#> And that 's quite a contrary uh set of circumstances from say a sudden difference of level which you might get uh from a vertical edge<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes well as I say most depressions do form a dish of some sort <#> I mean the only time you 'll really get a vertical edge on a footway is if there 's uh a classical pothole which is normally caused by frost action <,> by the <,> by just a sheer <,> a sheer cut through into the asphalt<S1B-063$E> <#> That 's a pothole<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes but it <,> this is this is a depression <#> This is <,> I mean all depressions will be dished <#> They don't <,> they don't go in a square <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear><S1B-063$E> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> difference in level between flagstones<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes<S1B-063$E> <#> And uh the likelihood of catching your foot in something is much greater uh when it 's a vertical or a sudden difference of level of land than when it 's dished <#> Isn't that right<S1B-063$A> <#> Yes if the vertical surface it 's safe I 'd say <,> reasonable to say that it 's more chance of trapping a toe for example or a heel<S1B-063$E> <#> And uh if a department with limited resources tends to concentrate on that type of defect would that be something which you would see as a good thing</I>
