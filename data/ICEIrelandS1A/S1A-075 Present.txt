is it <,> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1A-075$A> <#> Talent shows and things <#> You probably <{> <[> won't like it </[><S1A-075$C> <#> <[> Line dancing </[> </{><S1A-075$A> <#> No <&> laughter </&> <#> You probably won't like any of them but<S1A-075$C> <#> Is it a big sort of Hindu affair<S1A-075$A> <#> Oh it 's not <#> Oh don't worry <#> You 're not going to be eh<S1A-075$C> <#> Mobbed by<S1A-075$A> <#> Mobbed or you 're not going to be <,> uh what 's the word <,> converted or anything like that <&> laughter </&><S1A-075$C> <#> Don't worry <,> <#> I 'm not that strong into religion<S1A-075$A> <#> Yeah I know <#> Well no I don't know but you know what I mean <#> Uhm well it 's just uh <,> it 's <,> it 's just a show they 're having <{1> <[1> because it 's </[1> around this time <#> And <,> it 's just kind of celebrating but <,> they 're just having little items <{2> <[2> on stage </[2> you know like musical items <,> and things like that <#> Like traditional like the dance I 'm doing I 'm doing with seven other people <#> There are eight of us altogether <#> And it 's a traditional dance from <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <#> You know that 's where <,> you know the region where we come from <#> It 's just a folk dance <,> a traditional dance <#> And then there are other items like <#> I don't know some some of the little guys are doing some kind of a Michael Jackson dance <#> You can relate to that <#> Do you know what I mean <&> laughter </&> <#> But it 's fabulous <#> I saw the rehearsal <{3> <[3> like </[3> and it 's fabulous <#> It 's uh I

4 sylls </unclear> <#> No doubt the first thing when I come off stage <&> laughter </&> look at the state of you<S1A-075$C> <#> Oh great <#> That 's all you need <&> laughter </&><S1A-075$A> <#> Yes well ah I don't care <#> I mean I 'm doing it cos <,> I don't know why I 'm doing it <#> Well I like to <,> that kind of folk <{1> <[1> dance </[1> well I 'm not mad into going up on <{2> <[2> stage </[2> in front of a crowd of people but<S1A-075$C> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-075$C> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-075$C> <#> Sure it 'll be good craic<S1A-075$A> <#> It 'll be <,> yeah I

well <,> I 'm leaving it open like<S1A-075$B> <#> Yeah you know <{> <[> <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> </[><S1A-075$C> <#> <[> We 'll tell you </[> </{><S1A-075$A> <#> Yeah well like <,> if you 're

going so far<S1A-075$A> <#> Uh it 's not very it 's not too bad <#> I mean there 's some subjects that are absolutely horrible<S1A-075$B> <#> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear><S1A-075$C> <#> <{> <[> Quantum mechanics </[><S1A-075$A> <#> <[> There 's no chemistry <#> Ah no no no </[> </{> there <,> well we haven't actually started quantum I mean we touched all these things last year but <{> <[> we </[> <,> we haven't done it full-time I mean big time this year yet <#> We were just on inorganic really and organic<S1A-075$C> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-075$C> <#> Yeah <,> physical organic and quantum mechanics<S1A-075$A> <#> Well no actually <,> he gave us some notes on quantum mechanics but he hasn't gone into it big time yet <#> He has only given us notes <,> uh for us to be able to do the mathematics behind it which <{> <[> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[><S1A-075$C> <#> <[> That 's just wonderful </[> </{><S1A-075$A> <#> Well <,> so we to understand what 's going on <#> It 's all <,> determinants and matrices and all that shit<S1A-075$C> <#> Yeah<S1A-075$A> <#> Just for quantum mechanics like you know <{> <[> I mean </[><S1A-075$B> <#> <[> Hey </[> </{> people I 'm lost <&> laughter </&><S1A-075$A> <#> No <,> well there there is<S1A-075$B> <#> So are we <&> laughter </&><S1A-075$A> <#> But do <{> <[> you know </[><S1A-075$C> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> I know what you mean <#> <{1> <[1> All I 'm </[1> saying is <,> we 're all lost <#> Yeah mechanics <{2> <[2> and <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> </[2><S1A-075$A> <#> <[1> You know I </[1> </{1><S1A-075$A> <#> <[2> Oh right <,> it 's just uhm <,> </[2> </{2> well that 's okay <#> That 's fair enough but the subjects <&> clears throat </&> <#> I had exams on on Tuesday one is GLP and the other one was inorganic chemistry <#> I thought I knew my <.> inorga </.> remember <,> what day was it I was talking to you<S1A-075$B> <#> Uhm<S1A-075$A> <#> And you asked me to come <,> and I said no I 've got exams that time <#> Was it the night before my exams or two days before that<S1A-075$B> <#> It was a Thursday or Friday night<S1A-075$A> <#> Oh right okay<S1A-075$B> <#> Of last week<S1A-075$A> <#> Oh right <,> and I I didn't have time to study or anything<S1A-075$B> <#> No cos you were having people over and then you had the exams on Monday<S1A-075$A> <#> Yeah <#> And then I had the practice thing on <{> <[> Monday </[> as well and all that <#> So like I was panicking on Monday night <#> I had only read my inorganic twice so far okay <,> which was good I suppose considering <&> laughter </&> <,> you know <,> considering<S1A-075$C> <#> <[> Yup </[> </{><S1A-075$C> <#> Normal <&> laughter </&><S1A-075$A> <#> Yeah I suppose <,> But you know and then I started GLP at about a quarter to ten which is for the laboratory practices <#> And it was the biggest load of waffle I have ever read in my whole entire life <#> The most uninterestingly stupid subject I 've come across<S1A-075$C> <#> Mm hmm<S1A-075$A> <#> It 's just so boring so utterly boring <#> I can't express it enough <#> It 's just horrible <{> <[> and I need </[><S1A-075$C> <#> <[> We </[> </{> have these little notebooks on lab <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> you know guidelines and that on what to do and <{> <[> what not to do <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> </[><S1A-075$A> <#> <[> Oh well I mean we we had them </[> </{> in first year as well like <#> Don't <,> touch flame or don't stick your hand in the flame <#> That 's fair enough but<S1A-075$B> <#> Avoid wash bottles <&> laughter </&><S1A-075$A> <#> Oh stop here <#> I used to adore it<S1A-075$C> <#> Oh God <&> laughter </&><S1A-075$B> <#> Wash bottle <{> <[> technician </[><S1A-075$A> <#> <[> Oh </[> </{> no no <{> <[> not I just </[><S1A-075$B> <#> <[> Qualified after </[> </{> four years ' experience<S1A-075$A> <#> Yeah exactly yeah <#> No I 'm not that bad anymore <#> I mean I 'm usually pretty busy in the lab <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> and stuff like that <#> But I mean the any odd chance just turn around and squish you know <&> laughter </&> and I usually get screamed at <#> But uh what was I saying <,> oh yeah this subject is so uninteresting <#> Started reading it at about quarter to ten <,> ten o'clock <#> Oh my God there 's no way I can do this <#> There are twelve lectures I 've to get through <,> each of them consisting of four pages right <,> well two pages back and front which is four pages <,> the whole thing filled out nothing like no gaps or lines or anything like that<S1A-075$C> <#> In Maggie 's tiny handwriting <&> laughter </&><S1A-075$A> <#> It 's not even that tiny <#> I just hate the subject so much <#> I just sit here like scribbling the whole thing down you know <#> And it 's just everything is so repetitive <,> yet there are very very subtle differences in each sentence <#> You know what I mean <#> And they 're the stupid subtle things I can't remember <&> laughter </&> <,> so it makes it pretty difficult <{> <[> you know </[> <#> So I did big time waffle in that exam <#> And in inorganic <,> which I thought I kind of knew <,> and I <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> horrible <,> but I can kind of consoled myself cos I got my organic results today and I got ninety<S1A-075$C> <#> <[> Oh my God </[> </{><S1A-075$B> <#> Brilliant<S1A-075$A> <#> That 's just organic <,> everything else is just<S1A-075$B> <#> And this is the girl <,> who used to <{> <[> hate chemistry </[><S1A-075$C> <#> <[> Who used to fail </[> </{> and used to hate it as well<S1A-075$A> <#> I actually never passed a chemistry exam in my whole life <#> Oh no that was history I think <#> Yeah I never passed a history exam but then in the end I got an honour and <,> uhm<S1A-075$C> <#> You got an honour in chemistry didn't you<S1A-075$A> <#> No<S1A-075$C> <#> You didn't <#> And here she is doing chemistry and loving it and getting these really high marks</I>
