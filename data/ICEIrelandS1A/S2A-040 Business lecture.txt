<S2A-040 Business lecture><I><S2A-040$A> <#> This morning what I 'd like to do is wrap up some ideas on <,> human resource planning and appraisal <,,> <#> And before I do that let me say that the results of the decision round will be given out next week <#> And they make interesting reading <#> Brief interesting reading for some of you <,> and more interesting reading for others <#> So they 'll be given out next week when I collect the next decision round <#> Alright <#> Good <#> And for next week would you please have read uh compensation <,> uhm reward and compensation systems <,> pages one o two et-sequitur alright <,> <#> So reward and compensation systems please read for next week and that will take up the last two sessions before the <,> Xmas break and we 'll all go and have some festive fare <,> wherever we belong <#> And this morning I 'm presuming that you have read appraising employees so I want to get back to that <,> uhm <,> before we finish <#> Alright <,> what we 've been talking about <,> fundamentally <,> essentially even <,> and again will you just hold for four seconds before you write any of this down <,> is <,,> something that this model attempts to capture <#> So again <,> obviously you won't be able to write down every model between now and and May so let me just explain what what 's on what 's on here <#> The four key words are italicised around the edges of the circle <quote> grow buy sell maintain </quote> <#> In other words that one of the strategies <,> for your organisations or an organisation in its people-planning area <,> is <,> that it buys in people <#> That 's the exercise we 've been going through that 's the right-hand quadrant <,> right <#> You buy in individuals through external recruitment <,> just like you would buy in any other contract for <,> services <,> food <,> cleaning et-cetera <#> Another uh <.> inde </.> contract <,> is to maintain existing people <,,> <#> So <,> in your <,> recruitment strategies <,> the exercise of recruiting a European marketing manager which we went through <,> on the external market is just one possibility <#> Another is to maintain people <#> Another is to grow the individuals that you have <,> in some way <,> by development opportunities <#> And finally <,> you want to <,> colloquially <,> to continue to use the <,> buy sell <,> uhm matrix and so on <,> you want to get rid of some people eventually all organisations inevitably will <,> and that 's the sell decision <#> So <,> these are the human resource requirements <,> if you like <,> or the four axes of the quadrant or the four <,> dimensions of of of the model <#> So if you want to write those down <,> and encapsulate it in some sentence such as <,> there are four fundamental strategies available <,> to the human resource function <,> or to the organisation <,> regarding people planning <,> four fundamental strategies <#> <&Irish> Uimhir a haon </&Irish> <,> <&German> eins <&/German> <,> buy people <#> That 's the traditional recruitment method and we all see <,> uhm that we 're aware of as Fourth Commerce graduates-to-be<&> Student enters </&><S2A-040$A> <#> Morning <#> And <,> that we hope obviously to be very successful at <,> <#> As we progress <,> we are more likely to be <,> not so much have a job posted and be recruited <,> but we are likely to be maintained <,> in other words that we are likely to be in an organisation <#> So the second <,> we 're making this <.> in </.> into a list rather than a fancy diagram <,> number one to buy <,> number two to maintain <,> <#> And here clearly is the link to performance <#> Maintaining somebody in post <,> is only efficient when their performance is of some benefit or merit to the organisation <#> And that 's as we have discussed here one of the <,> utilitarian <,> caveats that are entered into regarding human resource management <#> In other words as a tool of management <,> who decides what performance <,,> <#> And an instrumental approach says <,> that managers decide <,> and that 's the way traditionally life has been<&> student enters </&><S2A-040$B> <#> Good morning<S2A-040$A> <#> Good morning <#> Obviously catching a lot of people on the hop here with an early start <,> <&> laughter </&> <#> Tells you a lot about the class <,> or me <,> or Danny <#> Just for the latecomers we 're <,> trying to wrap up the people-planning aspect of the course <,> and we 're suggesting this morning that there are four fundamental verbs <,> that sum up <,> human resource planning <,> buy <,> sell maintain <,> and grow <,> your people <#> So here in terms of maintaining people keeping them in in the place <,> there are <,> planning <,> performance of <,> planning of <.> perf </.> of performance <,> planning of compensation <,> and coaching or counselling which is different to training and I 'll come back to that <,> <#> Thirdly there is the growing on of people <,> and here you have some succession planning in small companies or in large companies for positions that are likely to be vacated through <.> rec </.> retirement <#> Seamus <#> Or <,> turnover et-cetera <,> <#> But we 've gone from buying externally on the external spot market for labour if you like <,> to maintaining our <.> inde </.> our internal people <,,> not just maintaining them clearly <,> <.> wh </.> which is a very if you like minimalist strategy we also need to grow them <,> and here <,> the idea is this is where training comes in <#> So the difference I would make between <,> maintenance and growth of individuals would be that often individuals need the odd bit of counselling <,> on <,> in a maintenance mode <,> in other words Mr Marsh <,> my mark wasn't great <,> why <#> Somebody from the MBA programme yesterday <,> saying uh our team isn't working out <,> can you give us a hand or whatever <#> Somebody from this class next week <,> Tim our team isn't working out <,> you 've helped the MBAs <,> you 've said you 'd do it <,> it 's on tape <&> laughter </&> <,> <#> Uhm can't get out of it <,> versus training <,> which is a career development strategy locked into and integrated with the organisation 's business strategy <,> <#> In other words <,> you 're in-situ <,> your <,> performance is adequate and so on <,> now let 's see if we can develop you in a certain way <#> If we want to rotate you <,> to various assignments <,> send you overseas send you to a different site <,> et-cetera <,> <#> And here fundamentally there 's the <.> iss </.> issue of reserve strength of the organisation <,> to take a military analogy <#> In other words <,> what do we have what do we have in reserve <#> The old sporting analogy that the team is only as good as its panel <,> which is about to be proven by the Republic of Ireland now that Quinn is out <#> And uh we 'll see that the people who say well Quinn wasn't really up to much uh will have a great six months trying to find a replacement <,> who someone he <.> e </.> even half-way adequate <#> Et-cetera catches everything else which I haven't mentioned <,> <#> And finally <,> there 's the notion of selling <,> the human resource or or labour <,> very loosely of course we 're just using these as <,> verbs to get us thinking <#> Here we have <,> some kind of turnover is going to happen in other words <#> And again <,> the human resource function needs as the organisation 's eyes and ears regarding its labour force <,> to be aware of <,> turnover and uh attempt to manage it <#> The problem with all of this as we can see is Mr Marsh <,> it implies a <,,> come on I 've given you the words already <,> functionalist <,> instrumentalist <,> planned <,> rational <,> analytic <,,> and all those other words <,> approach to organisations <,> which as we know Tim is only one <#> It is contrasted by <,> Henry Mintzberg 's approach which is <,> that patterns of strategy emerge over time <#> That you can't always in a turbulent economic or business climate predict the future <#> You can't do the Ansoft and Andrews planned approach to strategy <,> which is terribly detailed and almost assumes a nice quiet room where you go and do this <,> while everything else is kind of maintained <#> You 're obviously too young to remember the Magic Boomerang <#> Programme on television <,> anybody ever see that <#> Does it ring any bell with <#> No it doesn't <#> Well for those of us in their early thirties <&> clears throat - laughter </&> <,> just about uhm <,> on the twenties side <,> the Magic Boomerang was this programme where this kid in Australia tried to save <,> a <,> kangaroo that was falling into a swamp <#> Threw his boomerang <,> and as the boomerang was <&> makes buzzing sound </&> everything stood still <,> allowing superhero to get to the kangaroo pull him out of the mire or tie the rope and so on <,> Batman-type stuff <#> And the uh same idea is is true of the uh planned approach <,> its critics would maintain <#> That it 's like as if somebody will throw a magic boomerang our competitors won't sell anything <,> markets won't move governments won't intervene <,> consumers will customers will still be loyal staff will still be here and so on <#> And in the time the boomerang is whirring around we can do things to the company <#> We can plan for turnover we can manage our staff we can and so on <#> Unfortunately <,> uhm that 's not always possible <,,> <#> In fact some people say it 's not <,> it 's impossible <,> given the dynamic that is the environment in which people operate <#> So for instance <,> if we take ninety-six FM <,> they introduce new programmes <,> new uhm jingles <,> new competitions all the time on a running basis <,> so clearly they are planning these things somewhere while the programme goes on <#> They don't stop for a day to say <,> there 'll be no radio tomorrow because we 're going on a staff development exercise <,> or we 're going to introduce our Budweiser World Cup competition so we need a half an hour to get it together and record it <#> Somebody is doing all that <#> So in other words the counterpoint is that you can manage because <,> what you do is you separate the planning function <,> from the doing functions <#> In <,> as organisations get more complex and more large <,> people are removed planners are removed from the doing <,> because they need to plan <#> The problem is in very large organisations <,> they get so removed they forget who they 're planning for <#> Which is one of the criticisms of the analytical planning approach <,> as you know from strategic management <#> So these are just four ways of looking at what we 've been talking about up to now <,,> <#> In other words there is more than one strategy <#> So if we contrast this as we try and do every week in our with our own situation <,> you are clearly not being employed <unclear> two words </unclear> dependent on the buyers ' market for labour <#> In other words you will see a job posted <,> it will be part of a recruitment strategy for company ABC Limited and you will apply <#> You will send in your bog standard CV <,> even though Tim said don't do that <,> and you 'll get a letter saying thanks but no thanks <#> And you 'll wonder what the hell happened and you 'll say <,> whoops <,> it 's a very soft labour market <,> it 's a buyer 's labour market <#> Nothing to do with me and my CV or the fact that it 's just the same as all all other Commerce students in Ireland <,> despite <unclear> 2 words </unclear> <&> student coughs </&> <#> Then you ring up your uncle and you get a job <,> in the company where he 's the boss <,> or your mother gives you the job or whatever <,,> <#> That can be scratched from the tape <#> It 's a very cynical approach <#> No Tim <#> What we do is <,> we realise that in fact the buying of labour is just one of the strategies available <,> and that there 're other ways <,> of doing things <,> maintenance growth and selling <#> The problem is these all other three depend on you being in the organisation <,,> <#> So we 've talked about job strategies before <#> Anyhow that 's the model <#> Do we have <,> do we want two seconds to take anything down <,> we 've all taken down <#> Good <#> Right <#> In the Irish situation <,,> there are a number of fundamental things happening <,> or <,> that are the case regarding the Irish <,> market for labour <,> the Irish labour market <,> where these buy and sell and grow and maintain positions are taken</I>
