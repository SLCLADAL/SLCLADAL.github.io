<S2B-039 Frank O'Connor><I><S2B-039$A> <#> When talking about Frank O'Connor 's achievement <,> we must begin and end with his favourite art form <,> the short story <#> In between it 's important to salute the great range of his accomplishment <,> in the novel <,> in drama <,> autobiography and biography <,> in translation and criticism to say nothing of his amazing skills as a lecturer and broadcaster <#> But even in these various forms his overriding mode was the narrative <,> the challenge of telling a story with maximum economy and impact <#> One of my own absolutely favourite poems <,> is his eight-line translation of an eighth century Irish lyric <,> The Drowning of Conang <#> In the death of the young prince within sight of shore <,> O'Connor combines tragedy <,> ethic and lyric <,> within the same narrative phrase <#> <quote> The shining waters rise and swell <,> and break across the shining strand <#> And Conang <,> gazes at the land swung high in his frail coracle <#> Then she with the bright hair of foam <,> the blinding hair that Conang grips <,> rises <,> to turn triumphant lips <,> on all the gods that guard us home </quote> <#> The placing of that word <mention> rises </mention> at the beginning of the second last line <,> is the touch of a master rhetorician <#> The shining waters of the first line become the implacable goddess of the waves <,> who rises to prove the frailty of all human pride and aspiration <#> In the great O'Connor stories there 's always a moment like that <,> where the narrative rises quietly or fiercely <,> to reveal its inner meaning <#> Readers will differ in detail as to what O'Connor 's greatest stories are but few would dispute that the following list contains some of them <,> In the Train <,> The Majesty of the Law <,> The Bridal Night <,> Peasants <,> Uprooted <,> The Luceys <,> and the title story of his posthumous collection <,> The Cornet Player Who Betrayed Ireland <#> Now it may be noted with dismay or rage that this list does not include some of his most popular stories <,> especially those masterpieces of early childhood experience <,> like The Study of History <,> My Oedipus Complex <,> The Drunkard <,> First Confession and so on <#> I 'll return to these celebrated tales in a moment <#> What I want to focus on for the present however is the idea <,> of the perfectly-timed moments of revelation <,> upon which these other and to my mind greater O'Connor stories depend <#> In The Train a story adapted in nineteen thirty-seven for the Abbey stage in collaboration with Hugh Hunt <,> unfolds its pattern in the course of a train journey from Dublin to a village called Farranchreesht <,> in the West <,> Cork seaboard <#> The story begins with a gardai/ sergeant 's bored and snobbish wife <,> looking out the window of a railway carriage at Kingsbridge <,> dreading her return to that despised outpost to which her husband 's profession has doomed them <#> Then <,> in a passage of startling vividness <,> we see through her eyes what she calls their charming neighbours arrive on the platform <#> Into the pale lamplight stepped a group of peasants <#> Not such as one sees near a capital <,> but in the mountains and along the coasts <,> gnarled <,> wild <,> with turbulent faces <,> their ill-cut clothes full of character <#> The women in pale brown shawls <,> the men wearing black sombreros and carrying big sticks <,> they swept in ill-at-ease laughing and shouting defiantly <#> And so much part of their natural environment were they <,> that for a moment they seemed to create about themselves rocks and bushes <,> tarns <,> turf ricks and the sea <#> The collision of two worlds one modern bourgeois Anglo-Saxon <,> the other spontaneous traditional Gaelic is immediately established <#> And as the train rolls south <,> that contrast is revealed as being at the heart of the unfolding drama <,,> <#> Because these country people have come to Dublin to give evidence in a murder case <,> a crime of passion <,> in which one of their community Helena Maguire <,> has been accused of poisoning her husband <#> It becomes clear <,> that they have shamelessly perjured themselves to clear her name <#> It becomes equally clear <,> that they intend to punish her in their own way when they get her home <#> Indeed they 're outraged that she dares to return at all <#> The revelation I 've been talking about <,> comes in the third movement <,> in the exclamation of a woman who has otherwise stayed silent <#> <quote> Oh Farranchreesht Farranchreesht <,> cried the young woman with the haggard face <,> the ragged lineaments of which were suddenly transfigured <,> <#> Farranchreesht and the sky above you <,> I wouldn't change places with the Queen of England tonight <,> <#> And suddenly Farranchreesht <,> the bare bogland with the humpbacked mountains behind <,> the little white houses and the dark fortifications of turf that made it seem like the flame-blackened ruin of some mighty city <,> all was lit up in their minds </quote> <#> With the outburst of this anonymous villager <,> we begin to understand why these simple <,> subtle <,> religious people have so perjured themselves <#> The good name of the little village represents a higher value <,> than the alien law that has dragged them to Dublin <#> And the point is reinforced by Helena 's last word as she declares <,> that the man for whom she has killed is <,> no more to me than the salt sea <#> We share a perception which is at once spiritual <,> psychological <,> cultural <#> And we don't have to be Irish to experience as readers <,> the universality of that emotion <#> Similar moments of insight are reached in The Majesty of the Law <,> when Dan Bride explains to the sergeant <,> why he won't pay the fine <,> or when the peasants in a story of that name refuse to prosecute Michael John Cronin for stealing the funds <,> of the local football club <,> or when the narrator in Guests of the Nation realises that Jeremiah Donovan has no great liking for the two English hostages <,> whom he is destined to execute <#> O'Connor one of the few writers with a coherent theory of the short story form <,> believed passionately in the importance of these moments at which the writer finds to quote him <,> <quote> a point of vantage <,> a glowing centre of action <,> from which past and future are equally visible </quote> <#> Unlike the novelist the short story writer is engaged in what O'Connor calls a struggle with time <#> A refusal to allow it to establish its majestic rhythms <#> When the writer finds that moment <,> we are given to understand <,> the shape and meaning of his fable is delivered unto him <#> As with the drowning of Conang <,> the best of O'Connor 's short stories combine in this moment <,> the lyric and the drama in about equal proportion <#> What is remarkable about these great stories <,> or so it seems to me <,> is that they not do not concern <,> those shaping autobiographical events and issues that have haunted him Frank O'Connor personally <,> and which have made him the sort of writer he is <#> I mean those years of underprivileged childhood in the Cork city slums <,> his mother a domestic servant <,> reared in an orphanage <,> his father a violent alcoholic <#> At arm 's length during the war years <,> a terrifying <,> presence from nineteen eighteen onwards <#> Born in nineteen hundred and three young Michael O'Donovan <,> if that was his real name <,> was thirteen in the year of the Easter Rising and fifteen when his father was demobilised from the British Army after the Great War <#> He suffered the daily fate of a self-confessed mother 's boy in a ragamuffin <,> macho world <,> where that role was neither popular nor profitable <#> In Freudian terms that childhood was the family romance <,> rehearsed as nightmare <#> Add to this the sense of social shame he felt as a sensitive adolescent in such an intimate <,> class-conscious city <#> Yet <,> when he confronted this material in his chosen form <,> it all seemed to come out as comedy <,> sentiment <,> gentle self-mockery even whimsy <#> I mean all those stories of his childhood which delighted the readers of the New Yorker and the Atlantic Monthly <,> through the forties and the fifties <,> First Confession <,> My Oedipus Complex <,> The Genius The Drunkard and that comi-tragic tale The Duke 's Children which he recorded so memorably for radio before he died <#> Few readers or critics of these witty and accomplished stories have registered any sense of the agonised reality out of which they were born <#> That reality had to wait for the first great volume of his autobiography <,> An Only Child <#> But more of that in a moment <,> <#> These childhood stories on the contrary <,> are the works that prompted Francis Stewart to declare O'Connor soft-centred <,> and Patrick Kavanagh to describe him as sentimental <#> As if to excuse the tone and idiom of these tales <,> O'Connor shifted his ground from moments of intensity to a new concept of the narrative voice <#> In the introduction to a nineteen fifty-six edition of his stories he complains that <,> generations of skilful stylists from Chekhov to Catherine Mansfield <,> had so fashioned the short story that it no longer rang with the tone of a man 's voice speaking <#> He is not referring of course to the voices of dialogue <,> in which O'Connor <,> has no rival since Joyce <#> He 's really talking about the sound of his own voice <,> as it performs its various role as narrator <#> At best this aggrandisement of the speaking voice <,> becomes his guarantee of formal unity <#> At worst it becomes a substitute for technique <,,> an evasion of his struggle with time <#> In short <,> when the writer adopts the role and tone of the raconteur <,> there is danger that the story will decline into anecdote <#> Take the opening to The Genius <#> Some children are sissies by nature <,> but I was a sissy by conviction <#> Mother had told me about geniuses <,> <#> I wanted to be one <,> and I could see for myself that fighting as well as being sinful was dangerous <#> The kids round the barracks <,> where I lived were always fighting <#> Mother said they were savages <,> that I needed proper friends <,> <.> an </.> that once I was old enough to go to school I would meet them <,,> <#> The story goes on to recount <,> the child <,> little Larry 's infatuation with an older girl whose little brother had been killed in a motor accident <#> When she leaves him for an older boy his mother offers him the dubious consolation <,> that he had only reminded the girl <,> of her little brother <#> O'Connor 's last sentence reads <,> <quote> I felt it for the poor sad lonesome thing being a genius </quote> <#> It rounds the story off neatly <#> But perhaps a little too comfortably <#> The pain both of hero and heroine have been somehow <,> cushioned from us <#> I 'm not saying this in order to denigrate a body of fiction <,> that has held its own in the marketplace among discriminating readers who without the help of criticism or academe <,> for half a century <,> and which seem secure for a century to come if not indeed the millennium <#> I 'm just wondering aloud whether O'Connor was in fact cushioning this childhood experience from himself <#> Without that avuncular voice mediating between us and the experience <,> much of this childhood fiction would be unbearable <#> Young Larry Delaney trying to envision the alternative lifestyle he would have enjoyed if either of his parents had made better marriages <,> and is actually seeking out an old flame of his father <,> in a story coyly entitled The Study of History <#> The painful sense of an identity mislaid in The Duke 's Children <,> with its world-weary dying fall <,> wherein he sees his younger self as <,> one of those outcasts of a lost fatherland who go through life living above and beyond themselves like some image of man 's original aspiration <#> The Drunkard and My Oedipus Complex are deservedly famous <,> for their humour as well as for their psychological insight and shrewd social commentary <#> But when O'Connor came to confront the same experiences in An Only Child <,> there are no shock absorbers in the narrative tone <#> Here 's his father in the horrors <#> <quote> Jesus I 'll put an end to this <,> he would mutter <,> and take down the razor <#> His threats were never empty <,> as I well knew since the night <,> when I was an infant <,> and he flung the two of us into Blarney Lane in our nightclothes <#> And we shivered there on the roadway til some neighbours took us in <,> and let us lie on blankets before the fire <#> Whenever he brandished the razor at mother I went into hysterics <,> and a couple of times I threw myself on him <,> beating him with my fists <,> </quote> and so on <#> Having kept that nightmare at bay through one hundred and fifty published stories <,> O'Connor confronts it in the final decade of his life <,> in direct factual narrative <#> The second volume My Father 's Son has nothing of that force <,> because it it has none of its naked terror <#> The spectre had been exorcised</I>
