<S1B-017 Clinicians 1><I><S1B-017$A> <#> Right <,,> so we all survived anyway <&> laughter </&><S1B-017$?> <#> <{> <[> Yeah </[><S1B-017$?> <#> <[> Yeah </[><S1B-017$B> <#> <[> Just </[> </{> about <,,><S1B-017$A> <#> Okay uhm so you just need to go through yeah and evaluate your session plans uh written or whatever <,,> <#> <{> <[> Uh </[><S1B-017$C> <#> <[> When </[> </{> when do you want them for sorry<S1B-017$A> <#> Uhm today is it <,,> <#> Well I suppose if you can have them done by this afternoon yeah great <,> <#> Is that possible<S1B-017$C> <#> <{> <[> Yeah </[><S1B-017$?> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1B-017$A> <#> Yup <#> Okay <,> so those for this afternoon and then uhm you need to be thinking about for next week okay what you 're going to do<S1B-017$?> <#> <{> <[> Yeah </[><S1B-017$?> <#> <[> Yeah </[><S1B-017$?> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1B-017$A> <#> So oh just actually to go back to today in terms of the people who are doing groups right uhm <#> When you did the group rules I <.> pre </.> I <#> Is it safe to assume the rules were generated by both yourselves and the people who were the members of the group<S1B-017$?> <#> <{> <[> Yeah </[><S1B-017$?> <#> <[> Yeah </[><S1B-017$?> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><S1B-017$A> <#> Okay and so I 'd recommend that you write them down <,> <{> <[> uhm </[> and review them at the beginning of every <,> group session whatever<S1B-017$B> <#> <[> Okay </[> </{><S1B-017$B> <#> Okay<S1B-017$C> <#> When you say review them what do you mean <{> <[> like </[><S1B-017$A> <#> <[> Just </[> </{> go through what the group rules are <,> <#> <{1> <[1> Okay </[1> <#> So before we start it just go back <{2> <[2> over </[2> <,> uhm the rules we decided on last week <#> That kind of thing<S1B-017$C> <#> <[1> Okay </[1> </{1><S1B-017$C> <#> <[2> Okay </[2> </{2><S1B-017$D> <#> And would you suggest that we uhm <,,> like throughout the weeks you know the way especially these lead-up weeks to Christmas <,> that we keep reviewing things that we keep saying to them well like this is just the <,,> you know <{1> <[1> the beginning <.> assess </.> </[1> the initial stages of the <,> therapy <,> <#> Anything you find now tell me we can and then we can incorporate it into the therapy sessions <{2> <[2> each week </[2><S1B-017$B> <#> <[1> Initial stages </[1> </{1><S1B-017$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> I <.> gue </.> yeah I guess it 's going to depend on what specifically you 're doing <#> Do you know what I <{1> <[1> mean </[1> <#> So that if for example you are doing vocabulary and you decide to do geography words we 'll say whatever <,> and like you do five words per session <#> Uh but that yeah you 'd probably have a look if you on your second session you 're go back at what words you did on the previous session <#> Is that what you mean <#> <{2> <[2> No </[2><S1B-017$D> <#> <[1> Yes </[1> </{1><S1B-017$D> <#> <[2> No </[2> </{2> <#> I mean with things like rules <,> opinions <,> approaches to things <,,> that they <.> c </.> like that they know that they can comment on it and <{> <[> that they can <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> it </[><S1B-017$A> <#> <[> Oh of course <#> And if so if they </[> </{> think of any new rules or any rules that they think <{1> <[1> aren't </[1> you know necessary <{2> <[2> or </[2><S1B-017$D> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1B-017$D> <#> <[2> Anymore </[2> </{2> and stuff <{> <[> right </[><S1B-017$A> <#> <[> Absolutely </[> </{> yeah <#> Of course they can yeah <,> yeah <,> <#> Uh and then the other thing actually just <,> I don't know did anyone find in their groups today that they were maybe one uh participant who was more dominant than another <{> <[> <,> and </[> somebody who didn't really get a chance to kind of speak <#> Did you find that<S1B-017$B> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><S1B-017$B> <#> No I thought they were all speaking <#> I don't know cos <,> Jamie wasn't there <#> <{1> <[1> But </[1> I just thought that Michele was very like <&> sighs </&> whatever you know <{2> <[2> type thing </[2> <#> And <,> you know I did try and include her like all the time uhm <,> but she was kind of reluctant <#> And <,> then I felt I suppose <,> the guy <,> uh <{3> <[3> Glen <,> </[3> was kind of like <,> uh you know the cool guy but then again he 's a guy amongst four girls <,> <#> <{4> <[4> So I </[4> don't know <#> I 'll just wait til next week and see really<S1B-017$A> <#> <[1> Okay </[1> </{1><S1B-017$A> <#> <[2> Okay </[2> </{2><S1B-017$A> <#> <[3> Ah who Glen yeah </[3> </{3><S1B-017$A> <#> <[4> Yeah </[4> </{4><S1B-017$A> <#> Yeah I think really that that 's the key thing <{1> <[1> isn't it </[1> that this week was quite <{2> <[2> unstructured </[2> <#> You 're kind of just getting to <{3> <[3> know each other </[3><S1B-017$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1B-017$B> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1B-017$B> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3> and they didn't know they were together and <,> <{> <[> that kind of thing like so </[><S1B-017$A> <#> <[> Yeah exactly <,> <#> So </[> </{> it 's going to take a while for the group to gel like whatever so I wouldn't give <{> <[> up hope </[><S1B-017$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> <,> <#> It 's okay <#> I haven't<S1B-017$A> <#> Yeah <&> laughter </&> uhm I wouldn't give up hope yet <#> It 's yeah I think it 's you know it 's challenging <#> <{1> <[1> They 're </[1> a challenging <{2> <[2> age group because you know </[2><S1B-017$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1B-017$B> <#> <[2> Mm <,> and there 's </[2> </{2> a lot of them and they all talk together<S1B-017$D> <#> I was lucky with the two thankfully there was only two put into my small group <,> <#> But I think with the larger groups <,> yeah we want them to respect you and like you and all that but <,> I think we still need to hold a slight not even a slight but <,> you are authority <#> You you are the person in charge <#> Like you being kicked that was totally and utterly <,> unacceptable <#> <{1> <[1> I like </[1> I would have <{2> <[2> freaked </[2> <#> Not freaked but I would have actually<S1B-017$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1B-017$C> <#> <[2> I did </[2> </{2><S1B-017$C> <#> But no I took care of it like <{> <[> but </[> it you know it still happened you know<S1B-017$D> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1B-017$D> <#> <{> <[> But that 's </[> what I mean I mean what how are we to deal with that I mean<S1B-017$B> <#> <[> But then </[> </{><S1B-017$B> <#> Like how authoritative<S1B-017$D> <#> How authoritative <{> <[> yeah can you know </[><S1B-017$B> <#> <[> Yeah <,> can </[> </{> you <{> <[> be </[><S1B-017$C> <#> <[> Well I </[> </{> just said to them look straight off that 's not on <#> It 's not going to happen <#> <{1> <[1> It 's </[1> <,> it won't be <,> <#> That 's not the way it 's going to be and if it continues <,> you know I 'm going to have to deal with it in another way or whatever <#> <{2> <[2> Like </[2> I mean it stops <{3> <[3> you know </[3> <#> But it 's just they were just trying to prove a point I 'd say<S1B-017$?> <#> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1><S1B-017$?> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1B-017$?> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1B-017$A> <#> Yeah and I think it is it 's a tricky issues alright <{> <[> because </[><S1B-017$?> <#> <[> Yeah </[><S1B-017$C> <#> <[> No cos you </[> </{> cos you don't are you the therapist or are you kind of a dictator<S1B-017$A> <#> Exactly and that you kind of assume maybe that at that age they will be able to participate in a <{1> <[1> group </[1> without resorting <&> laughter </&> <{2> <[2> to kicking you and kicking each other </[2><S1B-017$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1B-017$C> <#> <[2> We had six year olds last year and </[2> </{2> they were fabulous like preschoolers even <{> <[> do you know </[><S1B-017$D> <#> <[> Yeah you see like </[> </{> you don't know I mean<S1B-017$A> <#> You assume that you kind of treat them in an <.> adul </.> you approach <{> <[> them </[> with an adult kind of perspective and you think that they should be able to <,><S1B-017$?> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1B-017$D> <#> <{> <[> Reciprocate that adult yeah </[><S1B-017$C> <#> <[> I still think you should do that though </[> </{><S1B-017$A> <#> Oh <{1> <[1> yeah absolutely uh exactly </[1> but it 's just that then <,> when they behave like that it 's kind of surprising <{2> <[2> because you </[2> think oh<S1B-017$D> <#> <[1> Oh I 'm not saying you shouldn't </[1> </{1><S1B-017$D> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1B-017$B> <#> Because it 's easy just to slip into a teacher kind of a<S1B-017$A> <#> You yeah and that kind of <{1> <[1> dynamic you know of I 'm in charge <#> And that 's not therapeutic <,> </[1> you <{2> <[2> know </[2><S1B-017$B> <#> <[1> Role yeah <#> Charge yeah <#> And be quite like yeah you know </[1> </{1><S1B-017$D> <#> <[2> That 's </[2> </{2> not therapeutic but then I think <,> we 're just we 're in a school situation <,> <#> I think I 'm I 'm totally for the <{1> <[1> therapeutic </[1> way of approaching of thing <#> I mean of all the people <{2> <[2> I 'd I 'd be very much for that </[2><S1B-017$A> <#> <[1> Oh yeah </[1> </{1><S1B-017$A> <#> <[2> And yes but you 're the group 's </[2> </{2> leader like <{> <[> and facilitator </[><S1B-017$D> <#> <[> You would still </[> </{> yeah <#> You 're a facilitator <#> Still you mean you need to <{> <[> make sure </[><S1B-017$C> <#> <[> Is there anything </[> </{> like we could flick through on the group dynamics or anything like <{> <[> that </[><S1B-017$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1B-017$A> <#> Uhm <,> I wonder <#> Now I can't think of anything off the top of my head I have to say <#> But maybe<S1B-017$C> <#> There should be some somewhere I suppose if you just went <{> <[> through a book on group therapy </[><S1B-017$A> <#> <[> There yeah </[> </{> on because there should be stuff on group <{> <[> work we 'll say </[><S1B-017$C> <#> <[> Clinical practicum </[> </{> actually I think there 's one <{> <[> or two books on that </[><S1B-017$A> <#> <[> Michael <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[> </{> <,> <#> And maybe that one I know that you said it 's out I 'll have a look at that one the Wallik and Butler one and see if there 's anything about<S1B-017$C> <#> <.> Wal </.><S1B-017$A> <#> Wallik and Butler <#> I can't think of the name but do you remember Lisa Marie I gave you the reference<S1B-017$D> <#> Yup<S1B-017$A> <#> Uhm and that 's all about <,> kind of language development in relation to the curriculum <{> <[> and </[> the classroom and working with adolescents<S1B-017$C> <#> <[> Oh </[> </{><S1B-017$C> <#> Oh yeah I actually yeah <{> <[> I had that book </[><S1B-017$A> <#> <[> But I think </[> <{> you were saying all the copies are out <{> <[> in the libraries </[><S1B-017$D> <#> <[> Yeah all the copies </[> </{> are out when I was looking <#> <{> <[> I 'm after booking one </[><S1B-017$C> <#> <[> Is that the pink one </[> </{><S1B-017$B> <#> Yeah<S1B-017$D> <#> <{> <[> And </[><S1B-017$B> <#> <[> I left </[> </{> I left it in yesterday <#> It 's there for you<S1B-017$C> <#> Oh okay<S1B-017$B> <#> Yeah I didn't see that <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear><S1B-017$A> <#> Okay I yeah I 'm not that familiar with it but there might be something in <{1> <[1> it </[1> or any of the uh kind of clinical practice books <{2> <[2> might have stuff on groups </[2><S1B-017$C> <#> <[1> Okay </[1> </{1><S1B-017$D> <#> <[2> You know what would be good too <,> books <,> </[2> </{2> <#> That course that we do <,> used to do in fourth year <#> It 's like <,> the teacher comes in and gives you this picture of all friends playing in the yard and <,> ye all 've to talk about what it is and it 's giving you <,> oh what 's the name of the course <#> The course you do<S1B-017$B> <#> Uh assertiveness is it<S1B-017$D> <#> No it 's not assertiveness <#> It 's like <,> the new CSPE course that they do for in schools now<S1B-017$C> <#> SPHC<S1B-017$D> <#> SPHC yeah <#> It 's like that but it 's<S1B-017$B> <#> Mm<S1B-017$C> <#> Is it civics<S1B-017$A> <#> Like civics is it<S1B-017$D> <#> Civics <{> <[> yeah </[><S1B-017$B> <#> <[> Oh okay </[> </{><S1B-017$D> <#> Those books have all are all into how <,> <{1> <[1> how </[1> you lead a group and how <{2> <[2> I was </[2> that 's where I got that thing over at my <,> my sister 's big into it <#> And she 's like Michele the way she 's pure oh I 'm so cool <#> You get her to do <{3> <[3> everything </[3> in the group <#> You get her to hand out the sheets <#> You get her to collect the sheets <,> <{4> <[4> because </[4> she 's being miss cool because she actually wants attention <#> She 's <{5> <[5> uhm </[5> there 's a niche in her <,> in her like in her mm <{6> <[6> whatever that I </[6> don't I 'll get one off my sister cos my sister is <,> does that course <{7> <[7> so she does </[7><S1B-017$B> <#> <[1> Kind of </[1> </{1><S1B-017$C>

it called Lisa Marie </[6> </{6><S1B-017$A> <#> <[7> But there must </[7> </{7> be I 'm sure yeah if you do like <,> <{1> <[1> a literature search </[1> or whatever and something came up about <{2> <[2> the dynamics </[2> <#> Uhm and try that is it I X quick dot com<S1B-017$D> <#> <[1> There 's a </[1> </{1><S1B-017$D> <#> <[2> <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> </[2> </{2><S1B-017$C> <#> What is it<S1B-017$D> <#> IX quick <,> <{1> <[1> WWW </[1> dot IX quick <{2> <[2> dot </[2> com <#> Yeah<S1B-017$C> <#> <[1> I </[1> </{1><S1B-017$D> <#> <[2> Q-U-I-C-K </[2> </{2><S1B-017$D> <#> Dot

<#> Is <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> done with it<S1B-017$A> <#> Yeah so you can you can just type in group plus dynamics plus <,> whatever <{1> <[1> and </[1> it rates things into in this like there 's stars as to which with the most is the best one <{2> <[2> match <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[2><S1B-017$?> <#> <[1> That 's great </[1> </{1><S1B-017$B> <#> <[2> Oh very </[2> </{2> good now
