<S1B-036 Midnight Court 1><I><S1B-036$A> <#> Brendan Purcell is a Catholic priest <,> who teaches philosophy at the University College Dublin <#> Professor Laurence Taylor is an anthropologist and a writer and he works at NUI Maynooth <#> Lorraine McColgan is a singer and a psychologist <#> Uhm Michael Commane <,> uh Lent is beginning <#> The Pope says that we should intensify our prayer and intensify fasting <#> Uh do you think he 's going to uh <,> get a welcome audience from young people here in Ireland who perhaps aren't interested in fasting and praying<S1B-036$B> <#> Whatever <#> I certainly can't speak for the Church and I certainly can't speak for the young people of Ireland <&> laughter </&> <#> Uhm <,> fasting never did anybody any harm <#> That 's the first thing I 'd say <#> Nor <,> does prayer do anybody <.> ha </.> any harm <#> The other day in West Kerry <,> a lady around my a woman around my age came to me as the result of a marriage split-up <#> She said to me one good thing it had done for me <,> her marriage split-up <,> it had made her conscious of the psalms <#> And she went upstairs <,> and she brought down the Bible <,> and she start started reading I think it was from psalm a hundred and seventeen <#> And it did strike me here was a woman in the middle of extraordinary difficulty <,> and she was <,> turning to prayer <#> I think everybody 's prayer is their own <#> I don't think you can pass an edict and say <,> this is prayer <#> I think it 's a very <,> personal a very private <,> commodity if I could use that word <#> Regards fasting <,> I could do with a bit of it<S1B-036$A> <#> Will you be fasting for Lent<S1B-036$B> <#> Well I I 'm often accused of wearing my heart on my sleeve but I 'm making a public national statement here that I 've given up alcohol for lent <&> laughter </&><S1B-036$A> <#> Oh right well we we 'll come back to you at at the end of Lent <,> <{1> <[1> and <unclear> 3 syllables </unclear> see how </[1> you 've done <#> <{2> <[2> <.> Th </.> that 's a hard one now Dan Dan where you come from Dan in Kerry <#> Yeah </[2><S1B-036$B> <#> <[1> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[1> </{1><S1B-036$H> <#> <[2> <unclear> several syllables </unclear> yes <#> I was going to </[2> </{2> to say that in West Kerry it 's a difficult thing to do <&> laughter </&><S1B-036$A> <#> Lorraine uh I think you 're a Buddhist aren't you <#> Uh do you believe in this sort of thing giving up things for Lent and <,> self-denial and so forth<S1B-036$C> <#> Okay uh I <{> <[> suppose </[><S1B-036$A> <#> <[> Will </[> </{> you be doing it<S1B-036$C> <#> I I won't be following it and while I 've never in childhood I never been <#> I was brought up as a Catholic and I never followed in any particular then <#> It never really frightened me or I never felt <,> never felt any meaning behind it for myself personally <#> Uhm <,> I <.> su </.> and I suppose that 'd be my answer <{> <[> to the question </[><S1B-036$A> <#> <[> But in in your </[> </{> faith is there a philosophy of self-denial <#> Are there parts of the year for example <{> <[> when </[><S1B-036$C> <#> <[> There 's </[> </{> there are yeah <#> There are reasons behind uh self-denial and there are ritually there would be more ritualistic <,> pieces that would require it <#> But I think that the main point is the understanding behind it and that and what that is <#> And it 's not just denial for the sake of denial where it 's actually a reflection of <,> the human state and degrees of attachment as <{> <[> as </[><S1B-036$A> <#> <[> You </[> </{> you almost have to be in <.> de </.> self-denial all the time <#> It 's an ascetic way of life isn't it<S1B-036$C> <#> No <#> I think that 'd be a bit harsh uh <,> way to understand it and I think a bit narrow <#> But I think that is part of life <#> And I suppose that the underlying philosophy being that <,> that everybody is seeking happiness and but perhaps doesn't act in ways that promote or invite it <#> And it 's to lead to a deeper understanding of how to maybe <,> <{> <[> go up that path </[><S1B-036$A> <#> <[> Right </[> </{> <#> Justine you work in the uh hedonistic atmosphere of uh <,> Bleak House in Middle Abbey Street where they produce Independent Newspapers <&> laughter </&> <#> Will you be giving up anything for Lent<S1B-036$D> <#> No <#> I won't be giving up anything but I 'll be <,> taking up something <#> Uhm <,> I think the whole idea of fasting for Lent is probably anachronistic and perhaps irrelevant at this stage because <,> it 's now a way of life to uhm abstain uh uhm you know <.> thi </.> this whole idea of the body beautiful <#> Women particularly I think watch what they eat all the time <#> I think there are probably better things we can do for Lent <#> Lent I think uhm you know like Lorraine was saying it 's about concentrating the mind and you know reaching a greater understanding <#> Uhm <,> I would <{> <[> hope that at the end of it I would have I will uh </[> well I don't know if it 's if you would consider it good but I 'm going to do something in my life <,> to make these forty days different to the rest of the year<S1B-036$A> <#> <[> So what you 're going to do something good for Lent <#> Is that what </[> </{><S1B-036$A> <#> Right <#> And it it will last for forty days but you 're not telling us<S1B-036$D> <#> Except for Saint Patrick 's Day <#> You get an opt-out clause don't you <&> laughter </&><S1B-036$A> <#> You you 're not telling us eh the <{> <[> full </[><S1B-036$D> <#> <[> I I 'll </[> </{> tell you yeah <#> I I 'm going to <,> pray <#> <{> <[> I 'm going to try </[> I 'm going to try and pray<S1B-036$A> <#> <[> Are you </[> </{><S1B-036$A> <#> Yeah well that 's really interesting <#> That 's so the Pope isn't wasting his time when he 's asking you to pray <&> laughter </&><S1B-036$D> <#> He 's wasting his time asking me to fast <{> <[> <,> not </[> asking me to pray<S1B-036$A> <#> <[> Yes but </[> </{><S1B-036$A> <#> Yeah but do you think people will listen to the Pope young people<S1B-036$D> <#> No <#> <{> <[> Unfortunately </[> not not in enough numbers no <#> I think at at the stage we 're at in our civilisation I think young people aren't listening to authority figures and they 're especially not listening to the Pope<S1B-036$A> <#> <[> No </[> </{><S1B-036$A> <#> Sure <#> Siraj the uh the Catholic Church has reduced the scale of fasting in uh I think in Lent to two days just Ash Wednesday and Good Friday and it 's a rather limited type of fast <#> You 're a Muslim and you have much more uh serious uh policies in relation to fasting don't you in the <{> <[> you have Ramadan <#> It 's </[> it 's far more extensive<S1B-036$E> <X> <#> <[> Yeah <#> That 's right </[> </{> </X><S1B-036$E> <X> <#> Well it 's for thirty days and it 's a whole month <#> It is during the day time not night-time so night-time you can eat and drink as much as is possible <,> drink in terms of soft drinks <&> laughter </&> </X><S1B-036$A> <#> Sure<S1B-036$E> <X> <#> Uhm but uh no I mean there 's no leniency as such <#> If you are a Muslim it 's incumbent upon you <#> It 's one of the five pillars of Islam <,> uh fasting and prayer uh alms-giving as well as pilgrimage and uh giving up uh giving out a certain amount of your income in in terms of uh <,> uhm <{> <[> alms </[> <#> Yeah </X><S1B-036$A> <#> <[> Alms-givers </[> </{><S1B-036$A> <#> Siraj many Catholics uh traditional Catholics admire the Muslim faith because it 's taking things quite seriously still <#> They feel don't you go along with that <{> <[> the Catholic Church </[> made a mistake in uh in a sense watering down all the obligations <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> places on the members of that faith<S1B-036$E> <X> <#> <[> Oh absolutely </[> </{> </X><S1B-036$E> <X> <#> Well I suppose just quibbling would not be right thing to do that <#> I mean Catholic uh has its own rationale <#> Islam has its own rationale <#> I mean five hundred years after Christianity comes Islam <,> and when you look at the value that Islam uh in a practical sense be it trying to practise them then it 's sense <{> <[> to </[> </X><S1B-036$A> <#> <[> What </[> </{> benefits does fasting bring to you<S1B-036$E> <X> <#> It oh not only the food or drink as people relate to it <#> It 's your conscience <#> It 's your tongue <#> It 's your eyes <#> It 's your ears <#> So you 're actually purifying <,> your pollution which you 've accumulated in eleven months <#> So the twelve months one of the months of the year you 're actually cleaning yourself <#> <{> <[> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[> </X><S1B-036$A> <#> <[> It 's like complete </[> </{> detoxification of the <{> <[> system </[><S1B-036$E> <X> <#> <[> Complete </[> </{> detox <{> <[> detoxification </[> </X><S1B-036$A> <#> <[> Mentally </[> </{> and physically <{> <[> and </[><S1B-036$E> <X> <#> <[> Absolutely </[> </{> and and re-honing your thoughts in your system <#> It 's a it 's a month of uh <,> uh so to speak uh of you know a spiritual reward <#> You read uh Koran <#> You uhm do a lot of good things <,> and you basically pause and reflect on towards yourself your family your community and entire globe <{> <[> and </[> </X><S1B-036$A> <#> <[> Brendan </[> </{> Purcell uh that 's very impressive isn't it <#> I mean uh why did you guys get rid of the fasting from midnight which used to be there <,> <{> <[> possibly when </[> when you were a young fellow<S1B-036$F> <#> <[> I 'd say </[> </{><S1B-036$F> <#> It certainly was <unclear> several syllables </unclear> <#> But I suppose what they were trying to do <,> I don't know if it worked uh they were trying to do to was to get back to the basics <unclear> several syllables </unclear> reliving your baptism <#> You know you were almost getting reborn again the chance to become a child again and so you went through a kind of ascetic <unclear> several sylls </unclear> so you could die on Good Friday and rise again with Christ on on on on Easter Sunday <#> But I I mean you 're asking the others what they would do but <#> I mean I remember some guy saying to me years ago like you know you know if you 're trying to love your neighbour you know you don't need a hairshirt <#> And I mean I would strike me as my to take your point about <{> <[> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[><S1B-036$A> <#> <[> Yeah but </[> </{> that 's not that 's not that 's not the question I asked you <#> I was saying to you did you make a mistake in getting I mean this goes right back to Moses <#> Moses went up the mountain for forty days and forty nights <#> Didn't he<S1B-036$F> <#> Yeah well <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> <#> I mean that was probably one of the reasons particularly forty days <#> It wasn't so much that if you like they were trying to get rid of it <#> They were trying to get people to remember what it was and to choose a bit more <#> In other words we weren't told we couldn't fast right through Lent <#> We weren't told we couldn't <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <#> People but they really were quite conscious that people were doing a lot of things maybe simply out of tradition <#> They had to do it <#> I mean I can remember days when people moved from the Diocese of Cloyne to the Diocese of Cork cos you could have four biscuits more at night-time<S1B-036$A> <#> Ah come on now<S1B-036$F> <#> They did it<S1B-036$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-036$F> <#> My parents told me that sort of stuff <#> No I mean people moved around<S1B-036$A> <#> They did <#> It 's sort of an <.> er </.> a forerunner of the new licensing laws where <{1> <[1> people were </[1> driving over the county line for a drink <#> <{2> <[2> Yeah </[2><S1B-036$F> <#> <[1> Absolutely </[1> </{1><S1B-036$F> <#> <[2> Absolutely </[2> </{2> but I still want to tell you what I 'm going to do during Lent myself and <unclear> 4 syllables </unclear> <{1> <[1> just similar to Justine </[1> <#> I am I am not a great driver as my insurance company and various people know <#> And some of the people <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> already have made a song up for me <,> uh called the title was Do You Love Everybody When You 're Driving <#> And so I 'm really going to try and put that into action next well like from Wednesday on is when I 'm driving if people cut out on me cos <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> I 'm right and they 're wrong <#> So I really want to make an effort to improve my the way I think of my <{2> <[2> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[2><S1B-036$A> <#> <[1> Oh yeah <#> What are you going to do </[1> </{1><S1B-036$A> <#> <[2> So the </[2> </{2> roads 're going to be safer<S1B-036$F> <#> I guess so well certainly around me<S1B-036$A> <#> Professor Laurence Taylor uh you grew up in a a secular Jewish family in New York <#> Did you go go in for fasting or <,> is there any<S1B-036$G> <X> <#> No uh is the the short <{> <[> answer to that </[> </X><S1B-036$A> <#> <[> But there is </[> </{> is there fasting within the Jewish faith<S1B-036$G> <X> <#> There is <#> <{> <[> Yom Kippur </[> </X><S1B-036$A> <#> <[> Yom Kippur </[> </{><S1B-036$G> <X> <#> Yom Kippur is the Day of Atonement <#> Uhm uhm but uhm as I was saying to you jokingly I think sometimes we <,> think our whole time on on earth is a penance <&> laughter </&> <#> Can seem that way </X><S1B-036$A> <#> Only in New York<S1B-036$G> <X> <#> Uh no no no <&> laughter </&> <#> Dublin <,> Dublin matches it any day of the week I 'd <{> <[> say </[> </X><S1B-036$A> <#> <[> Sure </[> </{> and what do you think about it <#> Do you think the Irish young Irish people are into fasting and praying anything like that<S1B-036$G> <X> <#> Well I think you know well I would say young <.> I </.> uh Irish people uh from my perspective uhm teaching <,> uh I would say the majority not but a significant minority uh would be <#> And in answer to the question whether the Pope 's wasting his time talking about it I would say probably not <#> Uh the evidence is you 're all responding to even uh even a response negative response is a response <#> Everybody 's thinking about it </X><S1B-036$A> <#> Yeah <#> <{> <[> Will </[> you do anything for Lent<S1B-036$G> <X> <#> <[> Uh </[> </{> </X><S1B-036$G> <X> <#> No uh not in particular </X><S1B-036$?> <unclear> several words </unclear><S1B-036$F> <#> I was amazed at the number the people you 'd see on Ash Wednesday <,> with <,> the soot on their <,> including the Taoiseach<S1B-036$B> <#> <{> <[> Yeah yeah </[><S1B-036$D> <#> <[> Yeah </[> <&> laughter </&><S1B-036$B> <#> <[> He he </[> </{> appears in Da/il E/ireann <#> And Brendan mentioned going from Diocese to <.> s </.> Diocese there was a thing in Cork <#> You know the <.> Con </.> the Conny Dodgers<S1B-036$F> <#> Yeah<S1B-036$B> <#> There was a biscuit some company in Cork made during Lent and you 're we 're only allowed a certain number <{1> <[1> of biscuits </[1> <#> And somebody made <{2> <[2> some company bought </[2> they made a big <.> bi </.> a really big biscuit<S1B-036$F> <#> <[1> Lapwing bars <#> </[1> </{1><S1B-036$F> <#> <[2> They weren't sweets </[2> </{2><S1B-036$F> <#> Yeah<S1B-036$B> <#> So that fitted the rule<S1B-036$F> <#> Yeah<S1B-036$B> <#> You were mentioning that I I think I think fasting is just the I think has to be a personal thing <#> I don't think you can impose</I>
