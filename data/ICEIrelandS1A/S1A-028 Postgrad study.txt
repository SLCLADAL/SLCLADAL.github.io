<S1A-028 Postgrad study><I><S1A-028$A> <#> So <.> wh </.> were you in today just asking about this<S1A-028$B> <#> Did you both say tea<S1A-028$A> <#> Yes<S1A-028$C> <#> Yeah <#> No he I had got the Forum 's money<S1A-028$A> <#> Uh-huh<S1A-028$C> <#> Sent me this thing to say that <,> I was in the top lot of the reserve list<S1A-028$A> <#> Mhm<S1A-028$C> <#> And a DENI form<S1A-028$A> <#> Mhm<S1A-028$C> <#> And I 'd to fill out the DENI form and I didn't <,> exactly know who to give it to <#> <{> <[> So </[> and there were a few other questions that I had about <,> cos it says in the thing that you 're registered for a Masters<S1A-028$A> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><S1A-028$A> <#> Mhm<S1A-028$C> <#> And then you want to do a <{> <[> PhD <#> And I didn't know what </[> to put down <#> Masters it says what is the <,> uhm <,> what type of degree or what type of qualification will you be registering for<S1A-028$A> <#> <[> Yeah and the standard down </[> </{><S1A-028$A> <#> Mhm<S1A-028$C> <#> And that sort of <,> I didn't know <{> <[> whether that was </[><S1A-028$A> <#> <[> But you do </[> </{> register for Masters first and then you change and register for the PhD<S1A-028$C> <#> Yes but the funny thing is on the form <,> not to confuse the DENI sort of <{1> <[1> administration </[1> <,> you actually put down PhD because that 's what you will be in the <{2> <[2> future </[2><S1A-028$A> <#> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1><S1A-028$C> <#> <[2> Ultimately </[2> </{2> doing<S1A-028$B> <#> <{> <[> Yes yes </[><S1A-028$C> <#> <[> Ultimately </[> </{> doing<S1A-028$A> <#> Well not unless you 're actually <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> and get knocked back<S1A-028$B> <#> What 's he only doing the Masters now<S1A-028$C> <#> No no <#> Well he might be if they if they say he isn't good enough<S1A-028$B> <#> Really<S1A-028$C> <#> And does he think it mightn't be<S1A-028$A> <#> Well he didn't get a very good impression from <,> do you remember a few months ago<S1A-028$C> <#> No<S1A-028$A> <#> He was <{> <[> he had </[> his <,> <#> They have<S1A-028$B> <#> <[> He tried </[> </{><S1A-028$C> <#> To have a first draft in or something<S1A-028$A> <#> No yeah the first few chapters and then that 's how they decide if you go on to the PhD or not <{> <[> <,> from </[> how well you 're getting on <#> And they didn't think it was very good and he sort of had to start from the beginning again<S1A-028$C> <#> <[> Oh right </[> </{><S1A-028$B> <#> How many more years has he to do<S1A-028$A> <#> Mm<S1A-028$B> <#> How many more years like <.> a </.> how much time has he left<S1A-028$A> <#> <{> <[> He 's </[><S1A-028$C> <#> <[> You 'd </[> </{> wonder how far wrong you could go<S1A-028$A> <#> No it 's that 's the thing <#> It does seem very poor that they let them go on so far <{> <[> before the first bit of criticism </[><S1A-028$B> <#> <[> Yeah yeah </[> </{> yeah<S1A-028$A> <#> Mhm <#> And then do you know what they do<S1A-028$C> <#> See that 's the problem with PhDs if they 're always saying you you 're not given enough supervision <#> <{> <[> Like if you 've finished your degree </[> <,> you know it 's a big big difference<S1A-028$A> <#> <[> Yeah I think especially </[> </{><S1A-028$A> <#> Mhm <#> Especially I think in <,> some of the politics I heard people complaining about <,> who the supervisors are <{> <[> <#> Because </[> it 's different than science cos you 're actually working with someone <#> Aren't you<S1A-028$C> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{><S1A-028$C> <#> Yeah but like at the same time <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> was saying <,> the guy he 's doing his PhD well wants to do his PhD with <,> doesn't have much communication with them <#> And like <,> the two people that are doing the PhD with him at the minute <,> one of them has seen him for the first time after fourteen months and the other 's seen him for the first time after sixteen months <,> which is an awful long time<S1A-028$A> <#> So they 're not actually doing research that <,> that person wants done <#> They 're just sort of working by themselves doing it<S1A-028$C> <#> Oh no <,> <.> t </.> <,> I think the difference with maybe sort of things like <,> sociology <,> and <,> geology you know <,> you know approaches to things <,> are pretty much <,> a matter of form <,> whereas like say with <,> <.> biologi </.> <,> well biochemical stuff like I mean you could take a variety of approaches to sort of <,> sort out things<S1A-028$A> <#> <&> laughter </&> In sociology there 's only one way to go <{> <[> about it <#> No that 's nonsense </[><S1A-028$C> <#> <[> No no no I know this </[> </{> yeah I mean that 's the point of the research <#> But there 's lots of <,> uhm <,> like I mean say if you were going to analyse a <,> a rock face I mean there 's probably only one way you can actually analyse it<S1A-028$A> <#> Uh-huh<S1A-028$C> <#> Whereas if you were going to make a gene <,> <{> <[> if you were going to change genes </[><S1A-028$A> <#> <[> So that so you mean </[> </{> <,> that by that that they can work better by themselves <,> cos they don't need so much help<S1A-028$C> <#> Yeah<S1A-028$A> <#> But then I 'm what I 'm saying is <,> people like Nathan doing politics <,> I mean he 's just I don't think he <,> his thesis 's on the UN <#> Now he doesn't have to do any research for that <#> What he 's doing <,> well <,> <{> <[> he has to do research <#> He doesn't do any research himself </[><S1A-028$C> <#> <[> He does that <,> yeah <#> He doesn't </[> </{> produce any results himself<S1A-028$A> <#> No<S1A-028$C> <#> Right<S1A-028$A> <#> He 's just <,,> analysing <,> different things <{> <[> like as if he was doing </[> a PhD in history<S1A-028$C> <#> <[> Yeah yeah </[> </{><S1A-028$C> <#> And it 's actually his own <,> personal sort of uh ability to write things up<S1A-028$A> <#> Uh-huh but the thing is you still <,> the reason you need supervision is to be given direction to know what way to go and to be said ways to go about this way this way <{> <[> because you </[><S1A-028$C> <#> <[> Or what </[> </{> avenues you should <,> <{1> <[1> research </[1> further <#> <{2> <[2> Mhm </[2><S1A-028$A> <#> <[1> Uh-huh yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-028$A> <#> <[2> Mhm </[2> </{2> <,> Anna Crowley 's is more of a scientific one so she actually has to go along do interviews and then <,> <{> <[> do her </[> own research<S1A-028$C> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-028$C> <#> Yeah <#> Oh well I suppose I mean if you were going to do that conflict resolution one you would have to sort of take<S1A-028$B> <#> There you go<S1A-028$A> <#> Why is there a PhD in conflict resolution<S1A-028$C> <#> No but your man who was doing research into conflict resolution like I mean I 'm sure you could do a PhD <{> <[> in </[><S1A-028$A> <#> <[> Which </[> </{> man was doing research in <{> <[> conflict resolution </[><S1A-028$C> <#> <[> Uh <,> the </[> </{> Serbian guy you were talking about <#> He wasn't doing research <#> <{> <[> He was </[> <,> over here with the UN and he was in Newcastle <#> Wasn't it Newcastle<S1A-028$A> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><S1A-028$A> <#> No he was in Birmingham and he <{> <[> wasn't with the UN </[> <&> laughter </&><S1A-028$C> <#> <[> Right </[> </{> <,> <#> Right he <{> <[> wasn't </[><S1A-028$A> <#> <[> He was </[> </{> lecturing<S1A-028$C> <#> Right<S1A-028$A> <#> But he was doing <,> I think he was lecturing on this kind of thing and he was <{> <[> doing </[><S1A-028$C> <#> <[> See </[> </{> how it could uh be like Western conflict resolution<S1A-028$A> <#> Mhm<S1A-028$C> <#> Uhm <{1> <[1> theories </[1> how they would <{2> <[2> integrate </[2> into <,> Serbian <{3> <[3> culture </[3><S1A-028$A> <#> <[1> No not </[1> </{1><S1A-028$A> <#> <[2> Yes </[2> </{2><S1A-028$A> <#> <[3> Yes </[3> </{3> Eastern European <{> <[> sort of yeah </[><S1A-028$C> <#> <[> Yeah so </[> </{> I mean like <,> I suppose you could get direction in what type <,> okay you would need a certain <,> sample of conflict resolution theories<S1A-028$A> <#> Yes<S1A-028$C> <#> And then you would need uhm <,> information on culture<S1A-028$A> <#> Mhm<S1A-028$C> <#> Or<S1A-028$A> <#> Yes <#> I know what you mean <#> That 's <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear><S1A-028$B> <#> Yeah <#> He was saying over at Dominic 's <#> Sorry to talk about something so much <&> laughter </&> less <,> important <#> <{1> <[1> Uhm no </[1> <,> no the guy in lives down the stairs in the flat downstairs in Angela 's house <,> <&> yawn </&> his girlfriend 's called Dominic <#> There was a phonecall for her the other night <,> <{2> <[2> and I said that </[2><S1A-028$A> <#> <[1> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[1> </{1><S1A-028$A> <#> <[2> Mhm Dominique </[2> </{2> Dominic<S1A-028$B> <#> No but <,> <.> D </.> just call her <{> <[> Dominic </[><S1A-028$C> <#> <[> Dominic </[> </{> <,><S1A-028$A> <#> Dominic is that not the masculine<S1A-028$B> <#> But they just called her Dominic<S1A-028$A> <#> Mhm<S1A-028$B> <#> And I thought there was another man living downstairs <#> And he said no <#> It 's a girl now <,> <#> And I said oh is that not a man 's name <#> And he didn't seem to think so <#> Well I suppose it 's sort of a very <.> C </.> Catholicy name isn't it<S1A-028$A> <#> Mm<S1A-028$C> <#> Dominic<S1A-028$B> <#> Dominic yeah <#> Saint Dominic<S1A-028$A> <#> Oh right<S1A-028$C> <#> I don't know <#> Maybe Dominique is just some kind of <,> <{> <[> posh </[><S1A-028$B> <#> <[> No </[> </{> but <,> <{1> <[1> no it 's not <#> No it 's </[1> like Dominique <,> ique on the end you know <{2> <[2> when </[2> you put E on the end of something it 's <{3> <[3> makes </[3> it <{4> <[4> feminine </[4><S1A-028$A> <#> <[1> Well it 's not </[1> </{1><S1A-028$C> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-028$A> <#> <[3> Mm </[3> </{3><S1A-028$C> <#> <[4> But that </[4> </{4> doesn't change it from <,> <{> <[> ic to ique </[><S1A-028$B> <#> <[> Well right enough because Dominique </[> </{> <,> <#> No<S1A-028$C> <#> <{> <[> You see it 's gonna be </[> Dominique<S1A-028$B> <#> <[> No it would <#> It would </[> </{><S1A-028$B> <#> Oh yeah well you do get Dominique <,> <{> <[> as well </[><S1A-028$C> <#> <[> Uh-huh </[> </{> but he was saying Dominic<S1A-028$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-028$C> <#> Right cos you can <,> Dominique <{> <[> would be </[><S1A-028$A> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><S1A-028$B> <#> Dominique or Dominique could <{1> <[1> be feminine </[1> but <,> Dominic <,> well not I mean why should you not have androgynous names <#> <{2> <[2> I </[2> mean I 've no objection <#> But he was surprised at me thinking like Dominic <,> was a man <{3> <[3> <,> <#> You know </[3> what I mean <#> It stands to reason I suppose<S1A-028$A> <#> <[1> Dominique </[1> </{1><S1A-028$C> <#> <[2> Mm </[2> </{2><S1A-028$C> <#> <[3> Mhm mm </[3> </{3><S1A-028$A> <#> Well did she have a masculine voice as well<S1A-028$B> <#> Oh I didn't hear her<S1A-028$A> <#> That was ridiculous <#> You didn't see it <#> Oprah<S1A-028$B> <#> No what <#> Tell me<S1A-028$C> <#> <&> tuts and whispers </&> Oh God it was desperate<S1A-028$A> <#> Absolutely <{1> <[1> desperate <&> laughter </&> <#> There was this girl on <#> This girl who was </[1> twenty-eight <#> And she said <.> sh </.> she 's quite a young <{2> <[2> voice </[2> and uh you know<S1A-028$B> <#> <[1> Is that what <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[1><S1A-028$C> <#> <[1> It was typical American rubbish <#> Typical </[1> </{1><S1A-028$B> <#> <[2> Oh </[2> </{2><S1A-028$B> <#> What like <,> <#> What did she speak like<S1A-028$A> <#> No she talks very high like that<S1A-028$B> <#> Oh I see<S1A-028$A> <#> Like that<S1A-028$B> <#> Was it really annoying<S1A-028$A> <#> Well <,> it no it wasn't actually <#> It there were there were other people on who sounded a lot worse than her <#> <{> <[> And she sounded </[><S1A-028$C> <#> <[> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> the </[> </{> man sounded worse to me <#> <{1> <[1> His voice </[1> was so aggressive and he <{2> <[2> just he wouldn't he just </[2> continued interrupting the whole time<S1A-028$A> <#> <[1> Yeah yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-028$A> <#> <[2> This this girl came on and she was saying </[2> </{2><S1A-028$A> <#> Mhm <#> <{> <[> But </[><S1A-028$C> <#> <[> But I </[> </{> mean that was more his personality rather than the voice<S1A-028$A> <#> No no no no no no no wait wait til you hear<S1A-028$C> <#> Just trying to show off as well <#> This was his little you know he was a real showman about it you know<S1A-028$A> <#> But this girl was on<S1A-028$C> <#> But <{> <[> mm </[><S1A-028$A> <#> <[> Wait </[> </{> <&> laughter </&> <#> This girl was on saying people have criticised my voice and everything <#> I don't think there 's anything wrong with it <#> I think my voice is fine <#> And <,,> uh but it 's supposed to be her flatmate <,> or her the girl that shared a room with her moved out because of her voice <#> Now obviously there was a lot more to the girl leaving than just her <{1> <[1> voice </[1> <#> And it was really embarrassing cos you 'd this girl stood up and she had a really deep voice and she was saying oh Christy really <.> use </.> used to annoy me and everything <#> And and Oprah says oh did you leave specifically because of her voice <#> And she said uhm <,> well yeah among other things <#> And it was obvious then it was the other things <#> <{2> <[2> But </[2> then so it went on back to this girl later on and this voice coach on <#> And uh she was saying I think my voice is fine <#> And he says no uh you could get it a lot more deeper a lot more authoritive <#> And she was saying well I can make my voice authoritive if I want to <#> And she could <,> speak you know more slowly and make her voice deeper <{3> <[3> <,> and </[3> everything <#> And he was going but you can get deeper than that <#> You can get deeper than that <#> <{4> <[4> But she was saying </[4> well it 's fine <#> And he was saying now say right right <#> And she was going right right <#> And he was going good <#> And she was going but that 's not me <#> That 's not my voice <#> And earlier on Oprah 'd been on and she 'd been uhm this girl was saying you know I like my voice <#> I think it 's fine <#> It 's me <#> I 'm bubbly <#> I 'm outgoing<S1A-028$B> <#> <[1> Mhm </[1> </{1><S1A-028$B> <#> <[2> Mm </[2> </{2><S1A-028$B> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1A-028$C> <#> <[4> Sure but what <,> but what </[4>
