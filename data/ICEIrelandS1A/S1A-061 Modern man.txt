Civil Service is in some ways excellent I find that because I have a creative temperament I find <,> I find uhm the atmosphere stifling<S1A-061$C> <#> Stifling <#> What do you mean by <,> stifling <#> That you 're not doing enough work or<S1A-061$A> <#> Well I find I find uhm that <,> that <,> I I find that <,> I find that the work <.> th </.> I find the people I work with and the mentality

and talent <#> And she uhm <,> she I think the field of medicine is particularly difficult <#> Uhm uhm I <,> I wouldn't I I I <.> ha </.> I haven't any aptitude for medicine <,> but if I had the aptitude I I think I would have liked to have done uh to have have worked in some branch of <{> <[> medicine </[> <#> But I I I think that of course Eleanor then <&> clears throat </&> as well as well <,> as as as being as being as being a good clinician she also uhm is quite uhm <,> knowledgeable in knowledgeable in literary matters <,> cos she has corrected me corrected me numerous times <#> And

nobody in it <#> Somebody had left the hand-brake off the car <,> and it started to roll <#> And I went oh my God <#> I could see the car hitting the wall before it actually did <#> It went back and it hit do you know the entrance post <,> where you come in with the <{2> <[2> big uhm </[2> <,> thing <#> Well it hit that <#> And I freaked out I came back here and I was as white as a ghost after it <#> I was that like <,> you know I might well just have been walking past and the car <{3> <[3> would 've hit me </[3><S1A-061$C> <#> <[1> Oh yeah tell Terry </[1> </{1><S1A-061$C> <#> <[2> Yeah

patients <&> laughter </&><S1A-061$B> <#> You don't have to be cruel Terry to be kind <&> laughter </&><S1A-061$A> <#> Eleanor you have to be cruel to be it 's <.> cr </.> you have to be cruel to be

<{> <[> here </[><S1A-061$B> <#> <[> I know </[> </{> where I 'm ending up tonight <,> <&> laughter </&><S1A-061$C> <#> Yeah<S1A-061$A> <#> So uhm uhm <,> what can I say uhm<S1A-061$C> <#> When uhm <,> do you go to college at nights Terry <#> What sort of times are you <,> at lectures<S1A-061$A> <#> Well Leah I have lectures on Monday and Wednesday <#> And I <,> uhm have two lectures on on Monday one at half past six <,> one at half past seven <#> I have <,> two on Wednesday one at half past six one at half past seven and then at half past eight I have a tutorial <,> <&> laughter </&> <#> Eleanor and I <,> <.> ha </.> <,> sorry yeah<S1A-061$C> <#> Have tutorials together<S1A-061$A> <#> <.> N </.> no well we don't we don't actually we don't we don't we don't <#> <.> Th </.> the tutorials are very interesting <#> I have a very nice uh <.> tut </.> a very nice <.> tut </.> a very nice girl <#> I won't say her name because you know it isn't you know but she 's a very very nice girl <#> And uhm <,> uhm <,> <[> <[> I do </[> like girls despite the sound of my voice <&> laughter </&><S1A-061$B> <#> <[> Ter </[> </{><S1A-061$B> <#> Terry you were describing the modern man to me<S1A-061$A> <#> Oh yes sorry <,> Eleanor asked me about the modern well the modern man <#> The modern man nowadays must have <,> must be jangling a bunch of keys <#> Keys of what <#> The keys <,> of a motor car <#> A BMW<S1A-061$C> <#> Why do you think that he has to have a BMW and keys and money<S1A-061$A> <#> Well <,> a <.> l </.> a lady needs to <.> b </.> to be driven around <#> She she can't be <.> expect </.> she can't be expected <,> to sit on the back of a bicycle <&> laughter </&><S1A-061$C> <#> I don't even get to sit on the back of a bicycle<S1A-061$A> <#> Well I think that you know a lady needs to be taken out and looked after uhm <#> <.> Despi </.> despite what the modern I know there is a <.> mo </.> a modern trend towards equality of the sexes and while I am in favour of equality of the sexes I think that <,> I still believe in the old-fashioned uhm uhm <,> in the old-fashioned uhm <{1> <[1> <,,> uhm </[1> standards standards <#> Like uh think a man should be able to drive <.> h </.> <{2> <[2> his his girlfriend home </[2><S1A-061$C> <#> <[1> Jangles </[1> </{1> <&> laughter </&><S1A-061$C> <#> <[2> So so you believe </[2> </{2> that a man should open a door for a woman and <,> uhm <,> let her go first and pay for her and stand back and<S1A-061$A> <#> Well I think <,> well well one thing I would would want to say about the BM <.> du </.> W and about the car there are some <.> w </.> women <,> present company excluded of course <,> but there are some women who judge a man <,> uh by his car <,> and I think that that is a <.> mis </.> that is quite a mistake <#> Uhm I think that <,> uh yes<S1A-061$C> <#> <.> El </.> Eleanor do you think money is important<S1A-061$B> <#> Yes Leah I think money is important to a certain extent yeah<S1A-061$C> <#> And <,> do you mean to sort of live comfortably or to <,> sort of <,> show everybody that you have the money<S1A-061$B> <#> No I mean that a man should be able to give a woman the type of lifestyle that she 's accustomed to<S1A-061$C> <#> Hmm mm that 's fair enough<S1A-061$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-061$A> <#> Yeah I would agree with Eleanor <#> I think that uhm uhm uhm <,> where marriage is concerned it 's alright when one is very young and when one has boyfriends <,> but I think<S1A-061$B> <#> Uhm is that what you call this Terry<S1A-061$A> <#> Uh it 's okay when one is young one can <.> o </.> one can have fun certainly <#> But I think that <,> uhm like the person whom a girl marries <,> has to be <,> she has to be very sure <.> o </.> of of and what what Eleanor says uh you know <,> the the important like people say the that the money doesn't matter and you know there are plenty of things you can buy without money <#> But at the same time if you haven't got money <,> you know <,> as my father has often said <,> at the end of the day somebody has to pay<S1A-061$B> <#> That 's true yeah<S1A-061$A> <#> Somebody has to pay <#> And I think that people who don't have there are there is a certain type of parasitically or is it parasitic <,> male who tend to to latch onto women <#> You know I mean I mean <#> I I I present company excluded of course but <,> uhm <,> that there there are certain types of men who they 're you know they 're kind of sort of fancy men and they they kind of <,> they 're dressed to the nines <#> Uhm <,> they wouldn't of course be wearing Este/e Lauder or <.> aftersh </.> uh uh Este/e Lauder because Este/e wouldn't allow it <,> or I <{> <[> wouldn't I I I wouldn't allow it </[><S1A-061$B> <#> <[> Especially if you couldn't buy it for them </[> </{> <&> laughter </&><S1A-061$A> <#> But but uhm but but <,> they they tend to be uhm now I I I 'm not one of those really even though I like to have things done for me but I 'm not really uhm I 'm more of uhm eh what am I I 'm more of I 'm more of an independent <{> <[> <.> lu </.> </[><S1A-061$B> <#> <[> Get up </[> </{> and go type<S1A-061$A> <#> Yes I 'm more of an independent get up and go type yes exactly exactly <#> Thank-you Eleanor <#> You saved me there now from an embarrassing mm decline</I>
