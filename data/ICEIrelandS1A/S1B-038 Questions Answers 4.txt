<S1B-038 Questions Answers 4><I><S1B-038$A> <#> Right coverage of the Iraq war has been described as media pornography <#> What does the panel think <#> John Bruton<S1B-038$B> <#> I I would think first of all that war is one of the most horrible experiences that humans can inflict on one another <#> And therefore seeing the full horror of war is actually an appropriate thing to happen in the media <#> Uh if people are objecting to the sights of the results of violence I think they 're wrong to object to it <#> Uh so I wouldn't describe it as media pornography although I must say I haven't seen that much of it myself <#> My own uhm view is that generally speaking the presentation of the of the war has been reasonably fair particularly on <,> I would say <,> RTE and BBC<S1B-038$A> <#> Mm <#> John O'Donoghue<S1B-038$C> <#> Well I suppose it has been widely said hasn't it in the past that the first uh casualty of war is the truth <#> And I suppose it has also been said that the victors get to write the history of wars <#> The fact that there are so many journalists uh at the coalface in relation to this war is of immense importance <#> I think in general terms that uh what we are uh seeing on our screens is quite frightening <,> the reality the immediacy <,> of war has been brought home to people forcibly <#> In that context I think though that it is important that uh we have accuracy <#> And I think that uh competing media organisations uh has led to a situation where very often now we find that the rush to be first very often means that <.> ac </.> accuracy is sacrificed<S1B-038$A> <#> But how do we know it 's accurate <#> I mean do you believe what you 're seeing <#> I mean what you 're seeing on your screen is obviously a form of truth but it is also selected by somebody <,> access is given by one of the belligerents probably in each <,> in many cases <#> So how do we know that <,> how can we know what to believe<S1B-038$C> <#> Well I think that uh certainly there has been a certain amount of uh misinformation and disinformation <#> We 've certainly seen the rush to be first cause accuracy to be sacrificed <,> for example in the case of Um Qasr which seems to have been captured now four or fives times at least by the US UK allies <#> Then we 've seen uh the story of thirty oil fields burning in southern Iraq and suddenly it becomes ten or eight <#> So I would say that uh what we see and what we hear does have to be looked upon very coldly <#> I 'm greatly minded of uh the inscription over William Butler Yeats 's uh grave uh <,> Cast a cold eye on life and death <,> horseman pass by<S1B-038$A> <#> Sheila O'Flanagan<S1B-038$D> <#> Well I think uh it was clear from from the outset that the media was going to play quite a big role in in this war <#> Uhm before the conflict ever started uhm we saw journalists being embedded in units <,> and I mean I think that has meant that the reportage coming back from those has had a particular slant and I 'm not trying to say that there 's anything wrong with what the reports are like coming back <,> but obviously if someone is living and and working with a group of people they 're going to take on uh the aims of that group of people so I think that that 's been an an issue <#> Uhm it was said that the set behind General Tommy Franks cost two hundred thousand dollars to construct <,> which obviously means that the US are trying to <.> por </.> portray a particular uhm image <#> Uhm a friend of mine talking about it today said to me <,> it was a little bit like watching reality TV <#> It was like being brought into some kind of Big Brother type situation where you 're watching all the protagonists <,> where soldiers are doing a job and then suddenly a journalist will come up to them and say <,> and how do you feel about this <#> Uhm and it 's quite a different thing I think to to almost anything else I 've experienced on TV <#> I find the twenty-four hour news channels <,> because they have to put on something for twenty-four hours <,> are showing you the same thing over and over again <#> And the impact of that <,> while horrific <,> at the same time I do think is is obscene <#> I mean I saw Baghdad being bombed <,> I don't know how many times <,> and each time it seemed to me worse than the last <#> And there was one uhm particular image <,> I think it was yesterday <,> where there were some ground troops who were firing on a sniper position <,> and uh they they fired the first missile and it missed its target <#> And then they fired the second missile and it hit the target <#> And as it hit the target they 're whooping and hollering and and shouting and cheering <#> And I can see from their point of view why they 'd be doing that <#> But at the same time you 're thinking to yourself <,> it 's hit that target and the people in there <,> they may have been firing at those soldiers <,> but the people in there have been killed <#> And it 's quite horrific to see that and know that that 's happening while you 're watching<S1B-038$A> <#> Right <#> <.> Maur </.> Maura Quinn<S1B-038$E> <#> I think that obviously the media have a very important role to play in the current war in Iraq uhm but I suppose I have a very jaundiced view of the accuracy of a lot of the reports<S1B-038$A> <#> And what is that role in your view<S1B-038$E> <#> Well I think they have a a job to tell us what 's exactly happening on the ground but I think certainly uhm when you watch various different media reports as the Minister had quite rightly pointed out <,> the accuracy of some of the reports coming through I think you know is very suspect <#> Uhm I think clearly it 's very difficult for the journalists who are actually in in Iraq currently to get out accurate information because certainly I would be aware of the controls that would be in place there on those journalists <#> But I think equally I find the <,> I find it actually quite obscene uhm the reports from the journalists who are actually embedded with the troops <#> I mean the idea of uhm journalists fronting reports wearing army flak jackets and talking about our boys are doing this <,> I think is quite obscene <#> And I think that there probably hasn't been enough coverage on the humanitarian aspect of this war <,> and on the fact that last Friday night we were watching bombs dropping at such a rate on Baghdad and the human cost and the psychological cost for the people in Baghdad<&> later on tape </&><S1B-038$A> <#> Doctor Tom Clonan is with us uh military analyst former soldier <#> What is your professional read on the <.> fu </.> on the shape of the war and the course that it 's taken<S1B-038$F> <#> Well I think there are two possible outcomes here <#> Uh one is based on the predicted outcome <,> that when confronted by uhm surgical strikes <,> to coin the the the phrase <,> uhm high-tech weaponry <,> that the people of uhm Baghdad would uh oust their own leadership <#> Uh that being the case the war will end will end quickly <#> The other scenario <,> and one which appears more likely <,> is that there has been an <.> antith </.> antithetical outcome or an unpredicted outcome where in fact the show of force on the part of the Americans has actually galvanised support for the defenders of Baghdad <#> If that 's the case you may see an intifada in Baghdad of <.> unpreceden </.> <.> pro </.> unprecedented proportions <,> and a fight that will draw Americans into the city and rob them of their technological advantage <#> And I actually think<S1B-038$A> <#> This is not in the American script is it<S1B-038$F> <#> No <#> And I actually think that this could be a war where everybody loses <#> Where there will be no winners <#> That the Americans will have to colonise by armour <,> street by street <,> and in the process will destroy the city <,> kill its citizens <,> and everyone 's going to lose in that kind of a scenario<S1B-038$A> <#> But could they even sustain that uh that at home <,> with the public opinion at home given the the rate of casualties which would be considerable if they were drawn into such a<S1B-038$F> <#> They can <#> They actually have sufficient numbers now <#> They 've reached critical mass <,> and as we speak uhm you know we 're seeing images of uh fire fights at Nasiriyah and Najaf and Karbala <#> What they 're doing is preparing a one hundred and twenty kilometre front <,> behind which they have battle space wherein they can now manoeuvre their formations for the final assault on Baghdad <#> So they can actually go in and level the city <,> but<S1B-038$A> <#> Well that 's hardly victory <,> that 's hardly liberating <,> Baghdad<S1B-038$F> <#> Well that 's war and it 's happened before and there are precedents for this <#> They did it <,> the Americans did it<S1B-038$A> <#> But in a television age could they call that liberation<S1B-038$F> <#> They did it in nineteen sixty-eight in a television age to the city of Hue<S1B-038$A> <#> Not television on this scale<S1B-038$F> <#> Certainly<S1B-038$A> <#> This is different isn't it <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-038$F> <#> Yeah I understand that <#> But I think uh if they do that they 're going to have major <,> I mean what I 'm saying is they can do it <#> They do have sufficient combat force mobilised to do it <#> But I think if they do it there 're going to be thousands of casualties and I think that you 're going to find Blair 's leadership under severe pressure <#> I don't think Bush will get re-elected for a second term under those circumstances <#> So it will actually be a war where everybody loses<S1B-038$A> <#> Mmm <#> Yeah yes <#> Man behind you there<S1B-038$G> <#> When they went into Hue <,> they lost that war <#> That was the Vietnam war and I think uh the question of how long uh this war will take <,> can't really be answered without taking into account the role of the opposition <#> The opposition to this war is international and it 's massive <#> Uhm I think in lots of the commentaries about the war it 's as if the only players involved are Iraqi troops and American troops <#> The reality in Iraq at the moment is the Iraqi people seem to hate the Americans and the British more than they do the dictatorial regime of Saddam Hussein <,> and with good reason <#> There is a long history of British and American uh imperialism in the Middle East carving up the area for their own uh interests in particularly the oil <,> but also just in the domination of that part of the globe like they wish to dominate the rest of the globe <#> And I think uh the portrayal uh as was commented uh earlier on <,> in the media of the opposition has been very poor <#> You 've no-one on your panel from the uh opposition movement and it 's huge and it 's international <#> In the Vietnam <{> <[> war which you raised </[><S1B-038$A> <#> <[> Our panel <,> our panel <.> repre </.> </[> </{> is not pro-war if that 's your point<S1B-038$G> <#> Well two of your speakers are pro-war <#> Uh John O'Donoghue is pro-war and your American Republican friend is pro-war <#> Uhm and uh I mean John Bruton would 've said that if the UN had voted for the war he would have <.> co </.> rowed in behind it and the bombing of Baghdad with UN approval <{> <[> would in some way have been different </[><S1B-038$B> <#> <[> Sorry I don't I don't think you should say </[> </{> what I should have said in any circumstances <#> I I made it clear from the beginning<S1B-038$G> <#> I did want to make<S1B-038$B> <#> Sorry sorry now you 're misrepresenting me uhm<S1B-038$G> <#> Sure<S1B-038$B> <#> Uh if you read my speech in the Da/il you will see that I said that I believed that this war with or without UN approval <,> was disproportionate <,> that the threat that it was intended to eliminate was not sufficiently great to warrant the loss of life that this war would 've would 've created</I>
