<S1B-076 Internet cafe><I><S1B-076$A> <#> Uhm <,> okay basically we are thinking <,> you know <,> an idea we 're <unclear> several sylls </unclear> doing at the moment is we 're looking for an internet cafe <,> where we can totally brand it<S1B-076$B> <#> Yeah<S1B-076$A> <#> Idea being that we 'd have <,> be <#> The whole cafe 'd be the Monster look and feel <#> We 'd have <#> You see cafes 're going to probably be quite strict about how much <,> you know <,> we can't paint Trump on the wall or <{1> <[1> whatever </[1> <,> but really as much as we can get <#> I 'm thinking the screensavers would be our home page <#> We 'd have like our mousemats around the place <,> some kind of way of getting <,> you know uh as as good as we can get it within their you know <{2> <[2> have as much <#> Yeah like I mean </[2> yeah like Trump coming out of the wall or posters or some Trump sort of on the ceiling sort of <,> <#> You know <{3> <[3> stuff like that </[3> <,> <#> But it 's going to depend on how much <,> they 'll allow us to do that <,> you know the way <#> <{4> <[4> I </[4> haven't even met them yet <,> <#> But I 'm looking to meet them and go in and say <,> well this this is our ideal situation <#> It would <,> the cafe would look like this <,> <{5> <[5> have it fully </[5> branded <#> And they 're obviously not going to go for <,> as much as we suggest <#> <{6> <[6> But </[6> <,,> I don't know I don't know how you 'd do it <#> Is it a <,,> like a photo or if I could bring in some kind of a <,> three-D thing that I can save onto a disc or something<S1B-076$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1B-076$B> <#> <[2> As much <,> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> branding stuff as you can get </[2> </{2><S1B-076$B> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1B-076$B> <#> <[4> Yeah </[4> </{4><S1B-076$B> <#> <[5> Uh-huh </[5> </{5><S1B-076$B> <#> <[6> Yeah </[6> </{6><S1B-076$B> <#> We probably wouldn't be able to do anything three-D <,> with our limited <{> <[> <&> laughter </&> <#> But what do you mean </[> <#> A little model or something<S1B-076$A> <#> <[> No not even three-D <#> Sorry uh uh like a </[> </{><S1B-076$A> <#> No an even <,> <.> li </.> you know those webcam kind of things<S1B-076$B> <#> Oh right yeah yeah yeah<S1B-076$A> <#> I don't know <#> Is that big <{> <[> cost or </[><S1B-076$B> <#> <[> No to </[> </{> to do that we 'd have to kind of go in<S1B-076$A> <#> And get a <{> <[> real camera </[><S1B-076$B> <#> <[> Decorate the the </[> </{> internet <{> <[> cafe and then film it </[><S1B-076$A> <#> <[> Yeah <,,> yeah </[> </{> <#> Or even could we get even a a picture of an internet cafe <,> any internet cafe and like <{> <[> superimpose Monster stuff on it </[><S1B-076$B> <#> <[> Yeah I got </[> </{> some pictures which I want to show you because <,,> they 're they 're just from some of those image catalogue sites <#> And they 're not brilliant but I just want to show you<S1B-076$A> <#> Mm<S1B-076$B> <#> And you can say that was <{> <[> that 's good or bad </[> <,> <#> So do you have any particular cafe in mind <#> Or is it<S1B-076$A> <#> <[> That 's good <#> Okay cool </[> </{><S1B-076$A> <#> Well at the <.> m </.> like what I 'm doing at the moment is just contacting them <#> I 've rung loads of them and arranged meetings <,> but I kind of wanted the creative <,> you know for when I go in and meet them<S1B-076$B> <#> Yeah<S1B-076$A> <#> Uhm <,> they 're going to be <,> the ideal one would be something like on Grafton Street or on Dawson Street <#> They 're two that I 've got meetings with tomorrow and next <{> <[> week <,> <#> So </[> the one in Grafton Street it 's a ground floor <#> They 'll be big <#> Have loads of computers <,> lots of space <,> uhm <,><S1B-076$B> <#> <[> Yeah so </[> </{><S1B-076$B> <#> Are there any on Dawson Street with <{> <[> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[><S1B-076$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> there 's one on Dawson Street <#> It 's called Yeah <#> It 's at the end near Trinity <#> Uhm the other thing is it 'll be <,> we 're looking for one that has come out <,> that serves food and coffee<S1B-076$B> <#> Yeah<S1B-076$A> <#> And maybe has like a cafe area to it for people who are waiting or whatever<S1B-076$B> <#> Right<S1B-076$A> <#> Cos we 're going to try and brand <,> the coffee cups <,> the bags<S1B-076$B> <#> The whole kit and caboodle <,> everything<S1B-076$A> <#> Serviettes whatever<S1B-076$B> <#> You name it <#> You brand it <&> laughter </&> <#> God it just makes me feel sick <&> laughter </&> <#> You 're worse than McDonald 's<S1B-076$A> <#> Yeah <&> laughter </&><S1B-076$B> <#> Okay <#> Cos I was thinking that if we had one in mind that you 'd already approached we could go in and take digital photos of it and then <,> do it <#> But that might seem a little bit cheeky <,> if you<S1B-076$A> <#> You see I <.> d </.> I don't want really them <{1> <[1> to </[1> <,> think that we 're to go in a step ahead of them <,> <{2> <[2> You know the way </[2><S1B-076$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1B-076$B> <#> <[2> Right yeah fair </[2> </{2> enough yeah<S1B-076$A> <#> Yeah I think I think if we just have <,> if we can get some photos of the internet of any cafe <,> and just kind of go well this would <,> basically is how it how it 'd look<S1B-076$B> <#> Cool <,> <#> So there 's going to be screensavers <#> Just so I know<S1B-076$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-076$B> <#> Where I can put on <{> <[> my </[><S1B-076$A> <#> <[> Uh </[> </{> screensavers <,> mousemats <,,> uhm something on the walls <,,> <#> I don't know if it would be posters or if we <{> <[> could <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[><S1B-076$B> <#> <[> Or what what about <,> you know <,> those cut-out </[> </{> cardboard cut-out chunky things<S1B-076$A> <#> Yeah <.> th </.> those kind of <{> <[> things yeah </[><S1B-076$B> <#> <[> That we </[> </{> have on the walls here<S1B-076$A> <#> Yeah <,> <#> Uhm <,,> <{> <[> maybe </[> ceiling stuff<S1B-076$B> <#> <[> There 's </[> </{> <#> Have you seen those dangler things that Fred has of <,> Buzz Lightyear and <,> all that <{1> <[1> kind of stuff </[1> <&> gets an example </&> <#> <{2> <[2> These 're </[2> apparently called danglers <,,> <#> <{3> <[3> So they have a </[3> a suction cup at one end and then something that dangles down at the other end<S1B-076$A> <#> <[1> No </[1> </{1><S1B-076$A> <#> <[2> Oh really </[2> </{2><S1B-076$A> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1B-076$A> <#> That 's cool<S1B-076$B> <#> I mean if you get little Trumps <,> <{> <[> like that </[><S1B-076$A> <#> <[> Trumps yeah </[> </{> <,,> <#> Yeah that 'd be cool <#> All that yeah <#> All that kind of gear<S1B-076$B> <#> Uhm so do you <{> <[> want <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[><S1B-076$A> <#> <[> Things </[> </{> maybe on the roof <,> like coming from the roof <{> <[> and that </[><S1B-076$B> <#> <[> What do you </[> </{> call those <#> There 's a point of sale <#> There 's a special name for those things that come from the roof as well <#> Can't remember what it is <,> but uhm<S1B-076$A> <#> The thing about it is <,> I don't <,> like uhm <#> We were <,> we were going to do this in the Special Olympic Village <,> as in <,> you know <,> you can buy a site basically and you can do it as you want <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> It would be like completely <unclear> several sylls </unclear> a whole thing it would be like completely <unclear> several sylls </unclear> into the Monster 's cave kind of thing<S1B-076$B> <#> Yeah<S1B-076$A> <#> So <,> but I suppose that 's probably going a step ahead cos these cafes aren't going to <,> completely want to sell out to us<S1B-076$B> <#> Mm<S1B-076$A> <#> But uhm same kind of idea <#> Just as you <,> like you 're going in <,> once you 're in there you know straight away it 's Monster and you know<S1B-076$B> <#> Monster land<S1B-076$A> <#> You see the brand and you recognise it for the rest of your life<S1B-076$B> <#> What what <,> kind of place would it be in the Olympic Village <#> It wouldn't be an internet cafe<S1B-076$A> <#> No it was it was an internet cafe we were going to do <#> I don't think we 're going to do it now because it 's too expensive <,> especially if we go with this idea <,> if this works <#> Uhm the internet village was basically <,> you can buy an area <,> any company that is <,> you know a sponsor like us <#> You can buy the an area maybe twice the size of this room <{> <[> <,> and do what you want </[> <#> So we were going to make it in like have get loads of PCs in there and the internet and have <,> just the whole Monster branded thing as if you 're like walking into a monster 's house or whatever<S1B-076$B> <#> <[> And just do what you want </[> </{><S1B-076$B> <#> Right <#> Monster 's house <&> laughter </&> <#> Monster world<S1B-076$A> <#> Uhm so it 'll be that kind of idea but probably not to the same extent <,> because these internet cafes are going to have their own restrictions<S1B-076$B> <#> Okay <,><S1B-076$A> <#> So I suppose it has to be <,> tastefully <,> done a bit more so<S1B-076$B> <#> And do you want me to kind of mock up <,> what the merchandise would look like <,> like coffee cups and<S1B-076$A> <#> Maybe <#> I mean don't go into too much effort <.> becau </.> but maybe just <,> <{> <[> so they can </[><S1B-076$B> <#> <[> Well we have </[> </{> <,> we have the coffee cups so we just can take photographs of those and put <{1> <[1> them on </[1> some little montage of <,,> <{2> <[2> different merchandising </[2><S1B-076$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1B-076$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> <,,> <#> So yeah the cafe part of it would have uhm the coffee cups maybe bags <#> If you could <,> put a bag on the counter or something <#> Uhm <,,> maybe like serviettes <,,><S1B-076$B> <#> What do you do in an <.> interca </.> in an internet cafe <#> You eat things and you look at the Web and you write <{> <[> things down </[><S1B-076$A> <#> <[> You look at the </[> </{> <.> we </.> I 'll show you one <#> The one on Dawson Street is actually really good <#> You walk in the door and basically <,,> and they 've a stand <,> a counter kind of here <,> like maybe the size of that desk<S1B-076$B> <#> Yeah<S1B-076$A> <#> And behind they 've loads of cookies and popcorn <,> couple of sandwiches like uhm <,> you know those orangejuicy milkshake-type things <,> and then they 've a coffee machine <#> And then just here they 've maybe four small enough tables <,> with like two or three stools<S1B-076$B> <#> Yeah<S1B-076$A> <#> Around each one <#> And then all in there 's is like <,> I 'd say about twenty laptops on uh <,> on either side <#> And then in the middle there 's another twenty<S1B-076$B> <#> Right<S1B-076$A> <#> So <,> and then on the <,> the wall is all glass so you know <,> you can have posters or whatever on the glass so that when people are walking by they 'll also see it<S1B-076$B> <#> We can uhm <,> branded notepads <,> <{> <[> and pens at </[> every work station or whatever<S1B-076$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1B-076$A> <#> Yeah the only like uhm <#> The thing I don't want to price too much is <,> too<S1B-076$B> <#> Free stuff<S1B-076$A> <#> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <&> laughter </&> <#> Yeah like to always have again Monster pens there <,> because it it might just work out a waste <#> I said <,> I suppose the most important thing is really the stuff on the walls <{> <[> and </[> <,> on the computers the <,> you know the <#> The screensavers I suppose will just be our <,> or not the screensavers but the home page <,> hopefully will be our home page <#> Uhm <,,><S1B-076$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1B-076$B> <#> The<S1B-076$A> <#> Things like that <#> You know that fly and stuff <&> points to art on wall </&> <#> I suppose that would <{> <[> be like the monster </[><S1B-076$B> <#> <[> That 's a </[> </{> bee Felice <&> laughter </&> <{> <[> it 's called a bee </[><S1B-076$A> <#> <[> Obviously </[> </{> <#> Uhm <,,> you know little Trumpy things sitting <{> <[> around the place </[><S1B-076$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> <#> Would it would it be the actual Monster dot IE home page <,><S1B-076$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-076$B> <#> You wouldn't have a special splash page for the Monster cafe <#> Cos that 's <,> it 's kind of boring to be honest with you <,> the home page one<S1B-076$A> <#> I was thinking of the home page just cos people might recognise it <,> but yeah <#> Maybe that 's a good idea to have the <,> <{> <[> the new one </[> with Jill Branded<S1B-076$B> <#> <[> You know something with </[> </{> <#> Something more like the brochure that 's just the bright orange<S1B-076$A> <#> Yeah <,,> maybe that as the screensaver<S1B-076$B> <#> Yeah screensaver <#> <{> <[> Exactly yeah </[><S1B-076$A> <#> <[> That would </[> </{> be the screensaver <#> And then that like hopefully we 'd have <,> the home page as <,> <{> <[> ours </[><S1B-076$B> <#> <[> Behind the </[> </{> <,,> when <{> <[> it wakes up <,> <#> Okay </[><S1B-076$A> <#> <[> Yeah <,> yeah </[> </{> <#> And then you can log in to whatever address if you don't want to go to Monster<S1B-076$B> <#> Cool <,,> <#> Yeah I was looking the other day just to try and find pictures of internet cafes <#> They 're not brilliant<S1B-076$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-076$B> <#> But we might be able to use one of them <#> Yeah I 've got three <#> So I was thinking it would be good if I could sneak in with a digital camera and kind of take a few photographs of one <,> but that would probably piss someone off<S1B-076$A> <#> You see I 'm just <#> If you go into the one in Dawson Street and then I meet him and go <{1> <[1> well </[1> this is our little spy who was in the other day <#> <{2> <[2> And I <,,> it might be better </[2> yeah but then when I meet them<S1B-076$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1B-076$B> <#> <[2> I could go in some other company </[2> </{2></I>
