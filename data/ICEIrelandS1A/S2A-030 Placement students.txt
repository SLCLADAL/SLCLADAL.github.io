<S2A-030 Placement students><I><S2A-030$A> <#> That 's fine <#> Thanks very much indeed <,,> <#> My name 's Peter Shaw and I 'm Chief Internal Auditor of the Eastern Health and Social Services Board <#> Uh as of the first of July last year uh we joined a new unit known as the Provider Support Unit <#> And the <.> pre </.> <.> pre </.> Provider Support Unit appears to have the same relationship with the Eastern Board as Enterprise appears to have with Queen 's <#> Uh they pay us but they don't necessarily control us <#> Now over the years uh we have had a number of placement students within uh the Board <,> and we have uhm processed them uh through the Internal Audit Unit <,> with <,> not very much success <#> So therefore when I got a phonecall from Bronagh <,> uh to <,> take on a couple of placement students my attitude was quite simply <,> how do I get out of this <,> but politely <#> I have a teaching contract with Queen 's and I didn't really want to jeopardise that much <#> And I had an awful feeling that in actual fact the two might be linked together in some way <#> However <,> as I said our experiences with uh placement students have been particularly bad in the past <#> And some of the problems can be summarised as follows <#> We <,> the Board tend to take graduate trainees and put them through uh a circular programme lasting about two or three years <,> and they visited a large number of departments and our department was one of them <#> So quite simply the problems that we found was this <#> First of all it was always a compulsory placement for them <#> And secondly <,> they had a very very poor image of Internal Audit <#> Now I 've yet to meet anybody or any youngster fourteen or fifteen years of age who turned round and said to me yeah I want to be an Internal Auditor <#> I really want to be an Internal Auditor <&> laughter </&> <#> So you 've got an image problem right from day one <#> <.> Sec </.> thirdly the placements didn't like the nature of the work that we did <#> Uh we uh the work that they were going to do in actual fact was going to be very much ticking and totting <,> and verifying work and they <.> wes </.> uninteresting and boring <#> And they were unwilling <,> they were unable to take responsibility and the range of work that we were able to give them was somewhat limited <#> And they were only in for three months so that in fact was far far too short a timescale <,> for us to do anything <#> So my initial reaction was when Bronagh got in contact with me was to get out of it <#> However <,> a number of things happened <#> At the beginning of April last year we took control of our own budget <,> and uh as our friends in Biochemistry said the money does count <#> And we started looking at <.> th </.> at things in terms of cost uh you begin to refocus your objectives somewhat more sharply <#> And we sat down and we thought about this <#> And first of all <,> these students were coming in for twelve months with a possible building on the extension of the three months <#> And I think the grant situation now almost ensures that you have the group for three months <#> So <,> they were going to be viable <#> They were going to be viable first of all in terms of skills <#> In other words we could teach them to do something <,> and <,> we were going to get some payback for it <#> And <,> secondly the time spent up there <,> they were going to be very cost-effective <#> Now this in fact negated a lot of the problems that we had before <#> So therefore we thought now in terms that this would be a very very good thing to do <#> But if it was going to be a very very good thing to do from our point of view we had to do a lot of thinking about it <#> And the thinking that we did can be summarised<&> break in recording </&><S2A-030$A> <#> Cos this was the sort of marketplace that we were in <#> We then <,> did a very careful briefing to all of those who were interested <#> We brought them down <,> and we told them what the job was all about <#> We described to them very carefully and we took a lot of time to do it <,> what were the roles and function of Internal Audit <#> We got a nice glossy glossy brochure made up <,> which in actual fact we needed anyway and we gave them that as well <#> And thirdly <,> we had <,> our main emphasis on the actual skills that the candidates would attain during their twelve months or fifteen months with us <#> So at the end of the day <,> we were <,> quite well assured that they were never going to end up as career Internal Auditors <#> Very few people do end up as career Internal Auditors very few of us around <#> You don't want too many of us around anyway but there are very few of us around <#> Anyway so what sort of skills were they going to gain <#> What in fact were they going to get out of it <#> Well first of all obviously there was going to be personal skills <#> Time management was one <#> This has already been brought up by the Biochemistry people that time means everything <#> We sell time <#> So time management was going to be one thing we were going to get <#> Uh there was going to be an opportunity of uh quite simply learning organisational skills <,> uh learning personal administration skills <,> uh the would <.> op </.> the opportunity ultimately if they prove themselves for leadership skills even <,> and all of these uh were <,> pointed out to them that this was what in fact was in it for them and what in fact they would get out of it at the <.> e </.> uh uh if in fact they want to come towards us <#> Now after all of that <,> we <,> then <,> attracted six people along for a final interview <#> And we set up the interview in the normal way in which any public body sets up an interview <#> We had uh no option <#> Uh we 've got to move with the Fair Employment Commission and we 've also to move with the Equal Opportunities people as well <#> And <,> we have got to organise ourselves <,> and run <,> interviews which in fact can be seen to be uhm properly-run interviews and all the rest of it <#> We 'd to do this and we 'd to do this as well <#> And we thought in fact that this was a very good idea because this would be another good learning exercise for the students as well <#> They could come along and they would be on an interview panel <#> Uh or they would see in fact how an interview panel operated <#> And we invited Bronagh to be present on that interview panel so that <,> she could feed back to students at the end of the day what in actual fact had happened to them where their good points were where their poor points were where what in fact they were going to have to bring out in future <,> uhm selections <#> So <,> we had the interview board and we had a representation from the university <,> and then finally we made our selection <#> And we selected two ladies <,> uh who joined us on the first of <,> July last year and who are still with us at the moment <#> And to be quite honest with you we were <,> or we in fact have been extremely <,> uh happy with the students that we 've got <#> I think <,> in summary <,> the whole thing can be <,> almost summarised quite simply as follows <#> That first of all so far as we have been concerned <,> that the whole exercise has been firstly <,> cost-effective <,> cost-efficient <#> Secondly there must be something in it from both parties <#> Now the students coming in uh <,> were coming in to do a specific job <#> They were an integral part of our department <#> They weren't supernumaries in any way <#> They were coming in to do a specific job <#> If we hadn't taken these students on <,> we would 've had to take on permanent staff to cover <#> And because of the fact that we were able to take the students on it worked well or things worked well for both parties <#> So therefore the placements must have a real job in the organisation <,> and they must see in actual fact what both parties are getting out of it <#> In other words they must be happy enough to realise that quite possibly we 're going to make a profit out of it <#> And I tell them uh both girls when they <,> every time I see them <,> uh you 're letting me go up to Queen 's this morning and you 're working your way you 're beavering away here quite happily uh so that I can go up to Queen 's and spout about this <#> And I can do this because in actual fact you 've made uh you have made it possible <#> Uh <,> so therefore from our point of view it has worked out particularly well <#> One point that I didn't emphasise earlier on was in actual fact training that we gave the students before they came in and joined us <#> We decided that if we 're going to select them and go to so much trouble to select them we were going to have to properly train them as well <#> So we had a two-day induction course and a formal two-day induction course of debt training <,> to explain to them in theory what we did <,> how we organised files <,> how we organised our work how the work was carried out <#> So they had an idea then of the theory of what we did <#> The second thing we did then was on the job training <#> We assigned them <,> to specific members of staff who would take them out on various audit engagements and quite simply show them the ropes <,> and that was melded in with their theoretical two-day training <#> Our ambitions were that <,> the students would begin to take charge of their own engagements around about Christmas or the beginning of the New Year <#> That in fact once they got enough experience out on various jobs they might begin to take charge of their own jobs and want to take charge of their own jobs <#> When they joined us it became very apparent very quickly that in actual fact they wanted to take charge a lot sooner <#> And they were very much capable of taking charge <#> So instead of Christmas we were <,> giving them the opportunity to take charge of their own engagements from September onwards <#> Now quite honestly they weren't that complex engagements they looked fairly straightforward <,> in order to build up their confidence <,> to let them see that in actual fact they were doing a good job and that they were achieving something <,> and that they could attend to their own audit meetings and take charge of their audit meetings and quite simply begin to manage the whole operation of an audit <#> And we have not been disappointed <#> And quite simply <,> the more responsibility they want to take the more responsibility we can give them cos quite simply they can just go on to more and more complex jobs <#> And we found out as I say very quickly we were able to do this <#> And they graduated to that much more quickly uh than in fact we had anticipated <#> So much so I am very anxious to get back to uh Bronagh this year and ask for two more placement students <#> And in fact we 've recruited two more placement students</I>
