<S2B-028 Harvest Home><I><S2B-028$A> <#> Anybody I 've ever met <,> and I meet a lot of people and I make it my business to try and bring people into the Province <#> In other words there 's no point in talking about it <#> Come here and experience it <#> And those people who do come and do experience it have told me on many occasions <,> it is definitely the best-kept secret <&> church music </&><S2B-028$B> <#> And I think there has been an element amongst the Protestant middle classes for the last twenty years as long as there was uh <,> there was plenty of ice for the gin and tonic and as long as they could uh <,> <.> th </.> the local golf course the greens were kept well-clipped <,> and there was a <.> r </.> a reasonable wage packet coming in every Friday uhm they really didn't give a toss<S2B-028$C> <#> I I think they are most certainly not pulling their weight in political life <#> Indeed I would go so far as to say that <,> since nineteen twenty-one <,> such weight as they have ever pulled has been constantly on the decline<S2B-028$D> <#> I think the dangers are that the middle classes of Northern Ireland and particularly the Protestant middle classes can leave it to others to try and sort out the problems of Northern Ireland <#> In the meantime you can enjoy some of the best scenery <,> some of the nicest people <,> and live on the belief that the Protestant work ethic is something very special <#> That 's the danger <&> church music </&><&> narrative </&><S2B-028$E> <#> The uh house that I have here would cost three or four times as much in England <#> Uh I 'd probably be commuting forty fifty miles to a job <,> whereas here it 's just from Bangor to Belfast <#> I think it 's a much better lifestyle over here<S2B-028$A> <#> The middle range now is from about a hundred to a hundred and fifty thousand <#> But two hundred thousand uh now is quite uh uh quite <,> I wouldn't say normal <,> but it is it is more frequent than it used to be <#> Uh in fact I would say that uh very shortly we 'll be in the half million pound property market here <,> which is something which I wouldn't have anticipated uh eighteen months ago<S2B-028$F> <#> Well the obvious one is the friendliness of people <#> Then there 's the overall quality <,> the quality of housing the quality of <,> leisure activities such as this <#> Over this past twenty odd years we 've shown the downside of Northern Ireland <#> We haven't mentioned the education system <#> We haven't mentioned the grammar schools<S2B-028$A> <#> Good schools but there are good schools throughout Northern Ireland anyway but particularly there are some nice schools down here <#> Uh but all in all there is that thing called quality of life where people move with relative uh freedom <#> Uh their they they enjoy the camaraderie <#> Uh there is a great uh uh professional basis here <,> a good business basis here <,> and and people just enjoy living here<&> narrative </&><S2B-028$B> <#> I think everybody in Ireland is concerned about the trouble and concerned about the violence <#> Uh <.> get </.> seeing that actually translated into action uhm amongst uh I think middle-class <,> middle-class Protestants if you like uh <,> most of them are <.> prep </.> prepared to uh wring their hands and let other people do the work<S2B-028$G> <#> Uh some of them have opted out of this whole question altogether and have simply decided to look after themselves their businesses and their families <,> maybe also their churches <,> uh and and their horizons are have therefore been drawn in to something which is uh which is personal family business perhaps church <#> Uh but I think you have got to do more than that <#> You have a Christian responsibility to go beyond that<S2B-028$D> <#> I think they 're slightly more understanding of the problems but on the other hand I don't they 're confronting the problems <#> I think the as long as they think of themselves as business and professional <,> as long as they are making their contribution by creating employment or indeed making money <,> and living as stable citizens <,> I think that ends their particular responsibility<&> narrative </&><S2B-028$G> <#> The Presbyterian middle classes in North Belfast uh are a part of a wider grouping of people <#> Now that wider grouping of people which is the the Protestant community needs reassurances because it it understands itself or experiences itself as a very insecure community <#> Uh and a lot of its I think its intransigence in politics for example is rooted in insecurity rather than in arrogance <#> Uh therefore they do need uh reassurances <#> Now some people find that very hard to believe because when when that community is looked at from the outside it looks as a very self-confident strong community <#> But in fact it is in my experience not self-confident and strong at all<S2B-028$H> <#> The Unionist community uh uh is manifesting its lack of confidence by uh happily sending their children over to university on the mainland and uh contemplating them taking up their futures there <,> and certainly making no effort to try and make them come back and settle down here <#> And that 's a most debilitating uh <.> b </.> scenario for the whole of of Protestantism and Unionism in the north of Ireland<&> students views on university </&><&> narrative </&><S2B-028$I> <#> We don't encourage them in the sense of saying they should go <#> What we do is make information available to them both about the universities in Northern Ireland <,> the Republic of Ireland and elsewhere in Great Britain and we try to be as up-to-date as we can and then they make up their minds <#> And of course a large number of them will choose to stay in Northern Ireland to go to Queen 's or the University of Ulster<&> narrative </&><S2B-028$J> <#> It 's a function of the Northern Ireland siege mentality of people withdrawing into themselves and failing to actually reach out and communicate with their fellow man <#> And that in uh is perhaps you know culturally determined the way that the the the Protestant middle class at the beginning of the Troubles found themselves literally uhm uh dumb before the the the the onslaught before the onslaught of uhm of expression from the Catholic side about civil rights <#> And instead of being able to articulate a point of view and and indeed reach out to people and communicate to them uhm we we saw the Protestant middle class withdraw into itself uhm abandon largely abandon <.> p </.> <.> p </.> politics through the seventies and the eighties and uh and therefore leave the Protestant community uhm uh with more extreme uhm articulators of its opinion than would otherwise have been the case leading in turn to a greater polarisation <#> Uhm and if the Protestant middle class had been as articulate as the Catholic middle class had been at the beginning of the Troubles we may well have been able to find some accommodation <.> be </.> <.> pe </.> between people <,> some communication between people at a much earlier stage<&> narrative </&><S2B-028$K> <#> The Unionist discourse was fine <#> Uh I think I 've said this earlier it was fine <,> so long as it was focused on Stormont and Stormont was given a reasonably free hand and the issue was seen to be to some degree settled and could be settled internally <#> And therefore all you needed to do was maintain a degree of Unionist unity and you were the majority and therefore you didn't really have to argue about political ideas <#> The money was coming in from London <,> things were reasonably secure power <,> was all you needed to uh to have and they had it<S2B-028$C> <#> What I 'm saying is <,> that there was no state power <#> Uh <,> Stormont administered Northern Ireland on behalf of the United Kingdom Government <#> For example uhm <,> the National Health Service <,> brought in by the Labour Government <,> administered in Northern Ireland <,> the reforms brought about by the nineteen forty-four Education Act and introduced here in forty-seven forty-eight <,> uh again by a uh Labour <,> uh Party <,> nevertheless administered by a Unionist administration that was in national terms very pro-Conservative <#> It is true however <,> that within the ambit of local government <,> and really Stormont was just a a super <,> council <,> uh there was uh <,,> relatively speaking a tremendous amount of patronage <#> Everything from planning to the appointment of schoolteachers to places in the civil service to jobs in the City Hall and in the local councils <,> was within the gift <,> of Unionist administrations <#> And therefore when I talk about them having no power <,> I 'm talking about state power about major issues <#> In terms of administrative gift and patronage they had a great deal of power<&> narrative and news broadcast </&><S2B-028$K> <#> Once that went in nineteen seventy-two the language of politics changed from uh holding the line to well what are the initiatives <.> nec </.> what are the constructive engagements you need to enter into to ensure that violence is eradicated to ensure that there 's a a proper and constructive relationship with uhm uh the Irish Republic and to what extent can you actually show yourselves capable of recognising what the discontent within the British political establishment is and what the needs of the British political establishment is without sort of coming out with your hands up or climbing into the dustbin of history<S2B-028$L> <#> I think Unionists probably are demoralised and that 's bad for <,> that 's bad for everybody <#> It 's bad for Nationalists as well because <,> it is uh <.> th </.> we 're talking about a very large number of people <,> uhm <,> and we 're talking about people a people whose roots are here and who are part of this society <,> uhm who have nowhere else to go uhm and who should see their future here <#> It 's demoralising and depressing for everybody <#> But young Protestants <,> talented young Protestants are leaving in increasing numbers <#> Uhm <,> it would be it would be good for everybody if if that demoralisation could be could be turned around <#> But I think <,> a lot of it is an unresolved feeling about the past <,> that uhm I think many Protestants feel <#> What are we supposed to say <#> Are we supposed to say sorry <#> Are we supposed to say I am guilty <,> because many don't feel personal guilt<S2B-028$C> <#> I think what you 've got to bear in mind is <,> that a large section of the Protestant middle class <,> <.> we </.> <.> we </.> were what the <,> Ulster poet John Hewitt would have called coasters <#> They weren't actively involved <,> in Unionist politics <,> but indirectly they got the benefit of a Unionist administration <,> and they were quite happy to coast along with it <,> and not direct their minds <,> to the uh the time bombs <,> that were ticking away <#> And then when the bombs went off <,> and they were alerted to it <,> many of them were able to say well you know I was never in the Unionist Party <#> Uh but their whole psychological sympathy was for the Unionist Party and what went with it <#> Then they suddenly found consciences<&> narrative </&><S2B-028$L> <#> I think part of the problem uh <.> o </.> of politics within Northern Ireland as distinct from anywhere else is that uh politics for too long has been identified with religion <,> and which side of the fence you you come from <#> So when you 're actually if you decide you want to become involved in politics uh you 've then got a problem of which party do you identify with uh <.> a </.> as distinct from which policies they support <#> And that 's a very difficult thing for a businessman to actually decide on<&> questions and narrative </&><S2B-028$K> <#> What they failed to do I think essentially <,> throughout the nineteen seventies and most of the nineteen eighties was actually to to re-examine their own propositions which in many cases are sound and uh as we can see uh is happening in sort of Eastern Europe aren't unusual <#> Uhm <,> I mean that the concerns that they have <,> has been the failure to try and rearticulate these to re-examine them <,> and to uh almost reinvent them <,> to reinvent a Unionist tradition which uh can appeal to the <,> a <.> p </.> a mainstream of uh intellectual argument in in Britain <,> Europe <,> the United States or even throughout the world <#> There has been <,> a tendency to think that numbers <,> uh are enough <&> reporter </&> <#> It <.> m </.> may very well be the case that historians would say that no matter what Unionists would 've had to say there were so many fundamental interests and purposes stacked against them that uh their cause was uh <,> one that uh couldn't be <.> mai </.> sustained or maintained uh in any case <#> But as uh there is that uh lack of trying to imagine even what the other side is thinking or what may even be necessary to do to win allies</I>
