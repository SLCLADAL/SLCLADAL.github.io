<S1B-013 Industrial policy 1><I><S1B-013$A> <#> Uh question three on on Michaelmas term of last year just as a matter of interest there <,> was uhm <,> or question four was <,> evaluate the impact of foreign firms with respect to employment in industrial regions <#> Now the last day we did the first <,> uhm we did the questions prior to that about the cause of regional inequalities and whether or not there was a case for regional intervention and uhm <,> we did some stuff on uhm capital bias and regional bias but you know I think I want to focus on this business of the performance uh of foreign firms and the impact of it <#> Uh now <,> who will start the ball rolling <#> Uhm <,,> John what about yourself <#> I know you have the figures there in front of you <#> But if I put up the figures first of all <,> I can put the figures on the slide <,> uhm <,> and you 'll have a <,> an impression of them for those of you who haven't got it there <#> The first slide basically shows uhm <unclear> several words </unclear> <&> moves OHP </&> <#> Is it visible at all there<S1B-013$B> <#> Yeah<S1B-013$A> <#> Is that okay <#> Reasonably okay <#> You have the handout somewhere <#> You should have the handout down in your notes if you haven't got it there <#> Basically what slide number one is showing is the distribution of both indigenous and foreign firms in Ireland <#> Really it 's probably easiest to focus on the summary at the bottom of the page <#> Uh you recall that we divided the country into western periphery and so-called eastern core <,> <#> Uh the western periphery being the sort of half-way down the the centre of the map which you have also <,> and the eastern core being the northeast the <,> the uhm southeast <#> Now I think you can use these figures here to answer that question about the impact of foreign firms with respect first of all to employment anyway <#> So Tom do you want to start the ball rolling <#> How <,> how would you tackle that<S1B-013$C> <#> Uhm <,> well to start with you 'd have to agree with the fact <unclear> several sylls </unclear> agree with anything <#> You 'd have to state the fact that foreign firms as it were create more jobs <unclear> several sylls </unclear> and have consistently done so from nineteen seventy-three to eighty-nine and you could back it up with figures that you 've given us two on the two tables <#> Uhm <,> in comparing the foremost indigenous with foreign firms you could say that the Irish firms as a rule have lost out <#> But you could counteract that <,> counteract that by saying the uhm grant system the grant scheme is geared more for foreign industries <,> multinationals than it is for indigenous industries as a rule <#> Any <.> indigen </.> indigenous industries that exist tend to have been <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> more traditional <#> They were older and as a result they have lost out through technology and time<S1B-013$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-013$C> <#> And consequentially they 've they 've had to <unclear> 1 syll </unclear><S1B-013$A> <#> Right <#> But if you were answering the question now would you be more specific <,> could you <,> would you be able to be more specific about it <#> I don't imagine you 'll remember all <,> all the figures but would you be able to remember any particular figures from the table <#> Supposing you 're chatting your friend in the buttery this evening or trying to impress your girlfriend about uhm your knowledge <,> trying to set up an alliance for the future <,> you 'd like to explain to her that you know so much about uh industrial policy and the impact of it now uhm<S1B-013$C> <#> Well for the foreign firms<S1B-013$A> <#> More detail more specific<S1B-013$C> <#> Right foreign firms just to take the total here have a gain of basically sixty-two thousand jobs in the region of between seventy-three and eighty <,> and they 've made a loss of twenty-seven thousand <#> In comparison the Irish firms made a gain of eighty thousand and lost seventy-two thousand so there 's a net change in value there of nine<S1B-013$A> <#> Are these these ones here <#> Is that what you 're talking about<S1B-013$C> <#> I 'm talking about the seventy-three to eighty<S1B-013$A> <#> Seventy-three to eighty okay <#> Gains and losses <#> Yeah <#> That one there<S1B-013$C> <#> Okay yes<S1B-013$A> <#> The net change<S1B-013$C> <#> Yeah<S1B-013$A> <#> No they 're the Irish<S1B-013$C> <#> Right<S1B-013$A> <#> And the foreigners <,> there is a gain<S1B-013$C> <#> So it 's three times as much <#> The foreigners are basically creating three times as many jobs<S1B-013$A> <#> Okay<S1B-013$C> <#> In the same period in nineteen seventy-three to eighty when granted there was <,> the economic times during seventy-three to eighty were really poor<S1B-013$A> <#> Okay right <#> So you 're <,> that 's the <.> unusual </.> that 's the unusually good time<S1B-013$C> <#> Yeah<S1B-013$A> <#> Does uhm <,> <#> Any any comments on that <,> Jamie<S1B-013$D> <#> I 'd be pretty much in full agreement with that one <#> Yeah <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-013$A> <#> Are you familiar with that data<S1B-013$D> <#> I am familiar with the data <#> Yeah<S1B-013$A> <#> Well would you care to comment on the later period <{> <[> Or any </[><S1B-013$D> <#> <[> The uh eighty-two </[> </{><S1B-013$A> <#> There for eighty-one now to <{> <[> eighty-nine </[><S1B-013$D> <#> <[> Eighty-nine </[> </{> right <#> Well in that period we can clearly see that there 's a <,> a net change in uh Irish firms <#> There 's a loss of uhm thirty-seven thousand jobs <,> a net net loss <,> whereas with the foreign firms there has been a net gain of a hundred and seventy-nine thousand<S1B-013$A> <#> Hold on now<S1B-013$D> <#> Sorry<&> simultaneous unclear </&><S1B-013$E> <#> You 've lost me<&> simultaneous unclear </&><S1B-013$A> <#> There 's something wrong there<S1B-013$E> <#> No <#> Just it it is just uh turn this thing out <,> yeah <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> Other way Derek <&> $A moves slide </&> <#> That 's better<S1B-013$A> <#> Okay sorry about that<S1B-013$D> <#> And we can see that overall there 's been a net loss for Irish firms of uhm thirty-seven thousand jobs in the period whereas the uhm foreign firms only lost three thousand jobs <#> So obviously they fared relatively better so it 's been a difficult period as a whole <#> The foreign firms due to you know better competitors and whatnot have succeeded <#> Not succeeded <,> have fared better in terms of losing less jobs in what was obviously a difficult period<S1B-013$A> <#> Okay<S1B-013$D> <#> I just think the eighty-six <unclear> several sylls </unclear> the amount of jobs <unclear> several sylls </unclear> the eighty-six <unclear> several sylls </unclear> diversified the uhm grant structure <,> you know <,> which I think would hit Irish firms more so than the multinationals because they will have the capital anyway <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-013$A> <#> Yeah <#> Is there anything else though <,> you 're talking about there the actual volume of numbers now <#> What about this business of uh regional dispersal <#> Would anybody care to comment on that <,> <#> Have the multinationals an impact in dispersing jobs to certain regions <#> Somebody else somebody else from the people who spoke on that <,,> <#> Who 's going to comment on that <#> Young ladies present<S1B-013$F> <#> Just that the multinationals <unclear> several sylls </unclear> industry throughout Ireland <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-013$A> <#> Okay be more specific now<S1B-013$F> <#> Uhm <,,><S1B-013$A> <#> Can you use the data to <,> to you know be a bit more explicit than saying that multinationals you know dispersed more widely<S1B-013$F> <#> Uhm <,> uh <,,> well three had uh three <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-013$A> <#> Go to table eight three <#> Go to table eight three and four <#> They 're the two best tables I think<S1B-013$F> <#> Eight three and four<S1B-013$A> <#> You should be able to draw conclusions about the dispersal from those and look perhaps at the uhm <,> at the summary <,> down at the bottom <,> the summary of the western periphery and the eastern core<S1B-013$F> <#> Here<S1B-013$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-013$F> <#> So you 're saying there 's a net change of <,> of minus ten thousand jobs <,> Irish jobs <,> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> in the western core and then minus twenty-seven thousand in the east<S1B-013$A> <#> And you and you go to table eight three first<S1B-013$F> <#> Yeah<S1B-013$A> <#> <&> to fieldworker </&> Are you picking up the sound of the voices do you think sufficiently<S1B-013$G> <X> <#> Yes <,> thanks </X><S1B-013$F> <#> Go to table eight three first and what would your conclusion be now<S1B-013$F> <#> Uhm<S1B-013$A> <#> I 'm trying to get you to be more specific about the regional dispersal of these jobs<S1B-013$F> <#> Uh well if you 're looking <,> if the policy aim was to get them to disperse into the western region <,> Irish firms have a net increase of six thousand two hundred and ten jobs<S1B-013$A> <#> Right<S1B-013$F> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-013$A> <#> Right<S1B-013$F> <#> Foreign firms have net change of eighteen thousand<S1B-013$A> <#> Correct <#> So the foreign firms really would appear to have had a much greater uh dispersal into the regions<S1B-013$F> <#> Yeah<S1B-013$A> <#> And even <,> what about the eastern core then<S1B-013$F> <#> Uhm the eastern core from Irish firms had an increase of four thousand nine hundred and foreign firms twenty thousand<S1B-013$A> <#> Yeah so they are three times better in all parts of the country really <#> And the same really that <,> this is really confirming what Tom said earlier really that <,> however you assess them they seem <,> whether it 's in terms of jobs themselves or in terms of regional dispersal <,> they would appear to be doing much better than the Irish firms <#> Take the eighty-one to eighty-nine period <#> Would somebody else comment on that now <#> Eighty-one to eighty-nine period uhm <,> <&> simultaneous and unclear </&> <#> This is eighty-one to eighty-nine now <,> <#> I don't <,> I think you 're going to have to really study these figures in a bit more detail <#> Because if you 're to answer that sort of question <,> you <,> it 's not enough to simply say well look foreign firms had an enormous impact and they they dispersed jobs into the regions <#> That 's not enough really <#> You have to be much more specific and and give precise evidence for your position<S1B-013$D> <#> Just as a matter of interest in an exam situation I always feel that <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-013$A> <#> No you won't have tables but I mean there are <,> there 's a small amount of key elements that you should be able to take out of the table I think <,> to to bolster up your position<S1B-013$D> <#> Would it be necessary to actually quote figures or would it just be more of a a general ideas of proportions you know <#> Like if we were saying say <,> there would you have to quote say the exact figures relating to how many people foreign firms uh were employing on the eastern seaboard or would it just be better to say the uhm that the the Irish firms employ twice as many as the foreign firms or would you actually be looking for figures<S1B-013$A> <#> Uhm well I think it would help <#> It would help to give some sort <,> I mean twice as many could be three as opposed to one and a half you know <#> It would be useful to have some indication of<S1B-013$D> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-013$A> <#> Of the total numbers <#> Now the total numbers are not that difficult it seems to me there<S1B-013$D> <#> Yeah <#> I mean this is early on in Michaelmas term right <#> With respect <,> the Regional Industrial Policy exams in the summer are only two exams in less than five days ' time <#> So the idea of studying these figures for summer<S1B-013$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-013$D> <#> It 's a bit<S1B-013$A> <#> Oh it 's a long way ahead<S1B-013$D> <#> Cos it 's a long way ahead<S1B-013$D> <#> You 'll have to forgive our lack of acuity at the moment you know <#> Relatively speaking at the moment our concentration <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear><S1B-013$A> <#> Well you 're on to other things at the moment<&> simultaneous and unclear </&><S1B-013$A> <#> I know and I assume you 're doing your forty hours ' a week study at this stage<S1B-013$D> <#> At the very minimum yeah<&> laughter </&><S1B-013$A> <#> See Jeff is a <,> Jeff is <,> a <,> he and I you know have often tutored together and we we always said to students twenty hours a week of lectures and classes and twenty hours of study and and serious study <#> Not talking to girls or boys during these periods <#> What are you doing at the moment <#> Are you doing <,><S1B-013$D> <#> We 've uh MIS on uh Monday <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-013$A> <#> Okay well then I 'm being entirely miserable and I 'm sorry uh to to introduce this uhm this detailed data <#> No okay well we needn't <,> obviously I don't expect at this stage that you would but I think <,> I 'm trying to make the point though that <,> if you 're going to adopt a position uh you really do need data <,> and at least in the dim and distant future you will have to<S1B-013$H> <#> We we know the trends at the moment and then like a few days before the exam we well we can sort of actually learn the figures <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-013$D> <#> So is it is it <.> act </.> a case of where like where trends gets you kind of a low two two whereas you know the numbers you get a two one <,> like that <&> laughter </&><&> simultaneous and unclear </&><S1B-013$A> <#> No <#> At the end of the day I 'm not very interested in examinations to be honest with you <#> And neither am I interested in indoctrinating you to particular points that you <,> I suppose I 'm trying to raise consciousness about uhm the issues and at the end of the day I have said many many times now so far <,> that you are the people who must draw the judgements <#> The exam I mean <,> I don't think the exams are are important really <,> <#> Uhm <,> they are well they are important from your point of view I suppose they are <#> But <,> the vast majority of people doing uhm Regional Industrial Policy do relatively well <,> I think <#> So I don't think that should be the focus of your attention <#> Rather it 's the material and whether you can be interested in it and whether you can relate to it <,> whether eventually perhaps you can influence change <#> Maybe that 's the really important issue <#> It 's a matter of being fairly critical of it and rather than making a very general statement to say well you know foreign companies are <#> Because there is a perception that foreign firms are bad news <#> I 've <,> I 've had that uh feeling myself for many years that well <,> all these multinationals are really bad news <#> They come into Ireland and other countries <,> especially less developed countries <,> and they uhm they milk the place of its of its grants and so on and its tax incentives and then when the going gets rough they leave <#> But when I <,> I did research on this thing and that that those tables I 've given you are based on some of that research <,> uh I did have to change my mind and at least I had to recognise that multinationals were you know creating quite a lot of jobs</I>
