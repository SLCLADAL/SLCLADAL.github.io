corner<S1A-060$B> <#> Remember in school you used to have Kris Kindle<S1A-060$A> <#> Uh yeah <#> I only had it for the one year now you know<S1A-060$B> <#> Well Eithne had it a number of years <#> I thought you had it over in Saint Teresa 's <#> <{> <[> <&Irish> Scoil San Treasa </&Irish> </[><S1A-060$A> <#> <[> Oh yeah </[> </{> maybe that 's right yeah <#> There was a bit of a problem though in secondary school with it <#> Got a bit out of hand you know<S1A-060$B> <#> Some of the presents were too extravagant<S1A-060$A> <#> People were being put under pressure to buy things that were just too much for them <#> So<S1A-060$B> <#> Well you see what happened if <{> <[> people 's </[> the generosity was <,> going overboard<S1A-060$A> <#> <[> If </[> </{><S1A-060$A> <#> They stopped it <,> and uhm basically because it was getting too expensive and stuff <#> And uhm<S1A-060$B> <#> I think they were right<S1A-060$A> <#> Mmm <{> <[> well yeah </[><S1A-060$B> <#> <[> All the </[> </{> <,> all the little children going home I want a big pressie for my Kris Kindle<S1A-060$A> <#> Well<S1A-060$B> <#> It got out of hand <#> There 's <{> <[> no doubt </[><S1A-060$A> <#> <[> Apparently </[> </{> people started giving each other things like cameras and things<S1A-060$B> <#> Oh <,> I 'd like that<S1A-060$A> <#> Mm<S1A-060$B> <#> I 'm tired <#> I feel like going to bed

will <#> You might even win your Christmas <,> your Christmas arrangement <,> your Christmas ensemble <,> <#> I 've all this work to do <#> It 's crazy <#> I 've so many things to do<S1A-060$B> <#> Stop moaning and get on with it<S1A-060$A> <#> Well <{> <[> yeah </[> <#> But everybody needs to have a little moan on and off <,,> <&> laughter </&> <#> I do <.> any </.> I do anyway <#> Everybody needs to let off steam <,> get things off their chest<S1A-060$B> <#> <[> Uh </[> </{><S1A-060$B> <#> How about a treat <#> <{> <[> Do you want </[> a fag<S1A-060$A> <#> <[> What </[> </{><S1A-060$A> <#> No I will not take a cigarette <#> I have given up cigarettes <#> No way <#> It 's a <{> <[> hard choice </[> but I 've managed it <#> No I 've managed it now<S1A-060$B> <#> <[> So have I </[> </{><S1A-060$B> <#> I have about four or five left in a box there <,> since I 've given them up and I was going to let you have a treat<S1A-060$A> <#> Yeah<S1A-060$B> <#> I don't mind you having one or two cigarettes a day <,> but this thing of puffing permanently into the sky is not on<S1A-060$A> <#> I don't puff permanently into the sky<S1A-060$B> <#> Well <,> almost permanently <&> laughter </&><S1A-060$A> <#> Not nearly<S1A-060$B> <#> When you were doing your exams you did a fair amount of puffing<S1A-060$A> <#> Anyway what film did you go and see at the weekend with Dad<S1A-060$B> <#> Uh <,> I 've forgotten the name of it <#> Uh<S1A-060$A> <#> That animated one The Lion King <#> Did you see that<S1A-060$B> <#> Ah that was beautiful <#> Yeah saw that the weekend before last <#> It was absolutely beautiful <#> <{> <[> I know </[> <,> <#> We went to this weekend to see Speed<S1A-060$A> <#> <[> Was it </[> </{><S1A-060$A> <#> Oh <,> I thought that was <,> really good <#> I really enjoyed that <#> It was really action-packed <#> It was great<S1A-060$B> <#> It was tense but it was a little bit silly<S1A-060$A> <#> It went yeah it was <#> And the romantic bit between uhm your one and your man was just you know <,> really was crazy <#> Really was<S1A-060$B> <#> We 're going to see the Lion King again <#> We liked it so much<S1A-060$A> <#> Are you<S1A-060$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-060$A> <#> Again<S1A-060$B> <#> Yeah <#> I 'm a child at heart <#> I 'd watch all the <,> children 's uh films happily <#> If this year Scrooge is on at Christmas I 'm taping it <#> And then anybody tapes over it they 're for the high jump <#> <{> <[> And </[><S1A-060$A> <#> <[> We had </[> </{> videoed it before<S1A-060$B> <#> I know and some bright person put something like Neighbours or Home and Away or <,> <{> <[> Melrose Place </[> or El Dorado over it<S1A-060$A> <#> <[> Those great </[> </{><S1A-060$A> <#> Those those great soaps <#> They 're they 're the biz <#> They 're the best<S1A-060$B> <#> They give a whole false impression of what life is about particularly university life<S1A-060$A> <#> Yeah but people always come back to reality after that though <,> you know <#> Anyhow I haven't decided what I 'm going to do this weekend <#> I 'll do something exciting<S1A-060$B> <#> Have a ball<S1A-060$A> <#> I 'm only free on Friday night because I 'm working on <{> <[> the </[> Saturday <#> Mm <,,> so it 's not too much free time is it <#> Actually the match is on tonight <#> I 'd say there 's some people going out tonight<S1A-060$B> <#> <[> Saturday night </[> </{><S1A-060$B> <#> Well for some reason there doesn't seem to be an awful lot of <{> <[> interest </[><S1A-060$A> <#> <[> No </[> </{> there actually isn't <#> No there 's not like <#> I mean <,> there was <,> well there was more interest for the uh <,> for the USA <{> <[> versus Ireland match </[><S1A-060$B> <#> <[> Oh </[> </{> why wouldn't there<S1A-060$A> <#> Yeah well<S1A-060$B> <#> Totally different ballgame<S1A-060$A> <#> Yeah I don't know what it was <#> See as well it was on on a Saturday night so <,> you know you 'd think that there 'd be more going out anyway to start with <#> And then you know <,> wasn't supposed to be <#> I was working that night as well and it wasn't supposed to be very good out because it was either over-packed or else it was just <,> you know it was too young or <#> Didn't work out at all <#> They ended up going into town afterwards <{> <[> and going to a dinner </[><S1A-060$B> <#> <[> So at twenty you <.> con </.> </[> </{> <,> so at twenty you consider yourself old<S1A-060$A> <#> Well there was sixteen and seventeen year olds there<S1A-060$B> <#> They should 've been home in bed<S1A-060$A> <#> Mm <,> well they should have been doing stuff like going to the cinema <,> or<S1A-060$B> <#> Ah there 'll probably be a fair few people around or <#> I wonder will Eithne feel she has to go out<S1A-060$A> <#> Probably not <#> It 's on at seven<S1A-060$B> <#> Oh well she 's going to the gym at seven <{> <[> or half seven </[><S1A-060$A> <#> <[> Well </[> </{> that finishes at <,> well that doesn't finish until <,> uhm <,> about half eight<S1A-060$B> <#> Well she obviously isn't planning on going but somebody will probably tell her today about it<S1A-060$A> <#> Yeah <,> <#> I was thinking about getting contact lenses <,> <&> laughter </&> <#> Except for <,> except for I only wear them for reading <#> But they 're so cumbersome <#> They really are <#> <{> <[> Mmm </[><S1A-060$B> <#> <[> If </[> </{> you were wearing glasses permanently <&> yawn </&> and you <,> felt that you know <{> <[> they were </[> spectacles were awkward but <,> you just wear them for study and <.> re </.> and not even for reading but just for study close study <,> you 'd be mad to get them<S1A-060$A> <#> <[> Ah yeah </[> </{><S1A-060$A> <#> Yeah well <,> if I was wearing them permanently I 'd uh I 'd definitely get contacts<S1A-060$B> <#> I always remember one night Rosemary lost her contact lens <,> in uh one of them in Jury 's <#> Just as we were going out the front door about twelve o'clock at night <,> we were all down on our hands and knees looking for the contact lens <#> And uh visitors <.> c </.> who were staying in Jury 's came in the front door and they all got down and they helped us <#> And she found it <,> <#> <{> <[> Mind you </[><S1A-060$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> you do<S1A-060$B> <#> Mind you it 's become the thing now to insure your contact lenses so I suppose it 's not too serious if you lose them<S1A-060$A> <#> Yeah <,> <#> <{> <[> What </[><S1A-060$B> <#> <[> What </[> </{> do you want for your dinner<S1A-060$A> <#> Oh uhm I 'd I 'd like <,> chicken<S1A-060$B> <#> Fried rice from Jumbo<S1A-060$A> <#> Chicken fried rice would be groovy <#> It would be really really groovy<S1A-060$B> <#> Yeah that 'd be quite nice<S1A-060$A> <#> Ah be quite nice really <{> <[> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[><S1A-060$B> <#> <[> I don't think </[> </{> your father would fancy chicken fried chicken flied lice <&> laughter </&><S1A-060$A> <#> That 's the way they say it<S1A-060$B> <#> Yeah chicken flied lice <#> I don't think he fancies it <#> I could get him sliced beef and mushrooms<S1A-060$A> <#> I think the problem with Dad is that he 's worked so much in hotels <,> that he just doesn't enjoy<S1A-060$B> <#> Uh he likes a good piece of roast <,> <{> <[> medium </[> done with nice veggies and potatoes <#> He 's not particularly on for Indian Chinese meals<S1A-060$A> <#> <[> Does he </[> </{><S1A-060$A> <#> Did you get the yoke fixed on the phone<S1A-060$B> <#> Yoke <#> What do you mean<S1A-060$A> <#> The code switch<S1A-060$B> <#> Well we 've had one false call today<S1A-060$A> <#> What<S1A-060$B> <#> We 've had one false call today<S1A-060$A> <#> Mm<S1A-060$B> <#> And it stopped <#> But basically I think it 's uh <,> it 's fixed <#> But the problem is the phone in the hall is as if it was crying <,> when it rings<S1A-060$A> <#> Ah it 's terrible <#> It 's so and you can't like it 's not even a ring anymore<S1A-060$B> <#> Ee ee <&> sound of phone </&><S1A-060$A> <#> It 's kind of <&> sound of phone </&> <#> It isn't it<S1A-060$B> <#> It 's like a <{> <[> miniature ambulance </[><S1A-060$A> <#> <[> It 's like a person </[> </{> <#> It 's like a person in pain in the hall <&> laughter </&> <#> It actually is<S1A-060$B> <#> Ah it 's better though I think since he changed the code on it<S1A-060$A> <#> Yeah<S1A-060$B> <#> I wonder when will he get his car phone put in<S1A-060$A> <#> Do you get it put in <#> Is it not just completely portable<S1A-060$B> <#> Oh yeah <#> He 's got to bring it into Donnybrook and get a number for it<S1A-060$A> <#> Mm anyway I 've a written a letter <{> <[> to the tax office </[><S1A-060$B> <#> <[> Well can I tell you something first </[> </{> <,> <#> Can I tell you something first <#> What I fancy is a telephone <,> whereby whoever rings you has to pay for the call<S1A-060$A> <#> Well you 'll be a long time getting <,> getting uh<S1A-060$B> <#> Be one sure <{> <[> fire way </[><S1A-060$A> <#> <[> Whoever </[> </{> rings you has to pay for the call<S1A-060$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-060$A> <#> But that happens anyway <#> You mean whoever you ring<S1A-060$B> <#> Oh gosh I 'm a bit mixed up now <#> That 's me <&> laughter </&> <,> on automation<S1A-060$A> <#> That was <#> On automatic <#> That was the way I was at work on Saturday<S1A-060$B> <#> Switched onto automatic<S1A-060$A> <#> Yeah <,> that 's the way you get after a while<S1A-060$B> <#> I have got to go into town and finish the Christmas shopping <#> Will you come in <{> <[> some day </[> <#> Saturday<S1A-060$A> <#> <[> Well uh </[> </{><S1A-060$A> <#> No I haven't done my Crimbo shopping and I don't intend to for a long time yet<S1A-060$B> <#> Your Christmas shopping <#> I wasn't talking about your Christmas shopping <#> I 'm talking about mine</I>
