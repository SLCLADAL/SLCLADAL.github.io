<S1B-019 English lit class><I><S1B-019$A> <#> Is he simply making the the notion of choice clearer by <.> pu </.> placing it back in a historical time where where people have less obvious choices <,> or uhm <,> or is <,> or is he saying that uhm in fact the twentieth century is also <#> That that <,> you know <,> while it <,> while people don't talk to you like a dog if you if you happen to be employed by them because if they do you 'll take them to an employment equality tribunal or something or you 'll walk out <,> or or something like that <#> Uhm but that <,> but that that 's only surface and that in fact the constraints are as major <,> <#> Do you think the constraints are internal <,> no <#> You think not<S1B-019$B> <#> I think uh like <,> I think he 's saying you know that we are we are limited like <,> in in this century <,> but we have multiple choice in like <,> in those terms you know <,> like <,> like we we can kind of marry who we want <,> things like that you know <#> We have a lot more choice in things like them you know <#> Kind of <,> we <,> there 's a lot like expected of us but like you know we can deviate quite a bit and get away with it you know <,> and they couldn't in those days<S1B-019$C> <#> But at but at the same time like good service got to be presented as an ideal and it 's still true that uhm we can never <,> we might chase that but it 's not really possible to end up with such uhm you know <,> the living happily ever after or whatever with that <#> Because <.> sh </.> uh when she becomes an actual person <,> that still that uhm these days like you can never make the ideal real I suppose<S1B-019$A> <#> Mm <#> It it 's quite interesting to compare <,> this with the first novel we looked at <,> Moll Flanders <,> because Moll you could say was somebody who makes those kind of choices <#> But there 's a totally different emphasis isn't there <#> I mean it is clear that one of the reasons that Sarah has to listen to Mrs Fulton is that she has no money <#> So that the sense of economic uhm oppression is fairly strongly there and it 's only at the end where she meets the <,> you know <,> the community of artists <,> uhm who are going to offer her a way in which she can both <,> you know <,> develop herself in some way and also be free of of want uhm <,> that uhm that she can escape from the grosser aspects of economic oppression<S1B-019$D> <#> You have Sam as well <,> who works <,> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> Sam <,> the servant who works with Williams<S1B-019$C> <#> Both of them<S1B-019$D> <#> Yeah <#> Both of them<S1B-019$A> <#> Mm <#> Now one of the things that would be different in the twentieth century would be that uhm people would on the whole be a lot freer from that kind of gross economic necessity <#> Wouldn't they <,> <#> I mean there 's the <,> well <,> I mean there 's almost nobody now who would be forced to go into that kind of almost slavery in in order to you know to get a bit to eat because we tend to live in communities which kind of say that everybody is <,> you know <,> is entitled to the sort of basic minimum <,> uhm might not provide them with much dignity but <&> laughs </&> but at at least there you know there is that kind of uhm feeling that people in society cannot own each other and oppress each other in in the way that 's represented in this book in in fairly terrifying terms <#> Because a lot of it <,> even <,> I mean even that subtext of the footnotes is about exploitation <#> I mean those child prostitutes uhm <,> the other Sarah <,> I mean what happens with the other Sarah <#> He 's he 's he 's looking for Sarah <,> he thinks that she might have gone because he thinks she 's a fallen woman <#> Uhm and he thinks she might have gone to London to become one of the vast mass of <,> sort of you know ladies of the night <,> women of the street sort of or whatever <#> And <,> so he wanders round London looking for her and he sees a woman uhm who looks like her <#> And in a sense of total and aimless desperation and despair he goes with her <#> And her name turns out to be Sarah as well <#> And it it it revolts him <,> and doesn't <,><S1B-019$D> <#> Mm <#> He gets sick<S1B-019$A> <#> He gets sick <#> Uh but he also discovers that this woman has been forced into prostitution because she has a child <,> uhm to keep <,> no <#> And it 's bringing home to him uhm a lot of things that he had not been prepared to accept about his society<S1B-019$D> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> describes Mrs <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> as Nazi-ish <#> So it 's sort of <,> it 's all connected <,><S1B-019$A> <#> But then <,> can we say <,> if he 's saying that these basic conditions or limitations on choice remain the same <,> why do you think he set it in the nineteenth century<S1B-019$D> <#> To stress it more<S1B-019$A> <#> Yeah that 's one <,> one possibility <,> <.> pre </.> present it in rather more extreme terms<S1B-019$D> <#> Yeah yeah<S1B-019$A> <#> Uhm the other one is is that a lot of twentieth-century novelists have been basically writing historical novels uhm because they see it as as a kind of uh escape beyond uhm limitations <,> uhm so there 's an escape either back into the past <,> where things are slightly different so that you can you can look at <,> you know the way if you take something out of its context and you put it into a slightly unfamiliar context it provides uhm that that sense of defamiliarisation which allows you to look at it afresh <#> You can do that either by going into the past or by writing <,> you know science fiction or fantasy or something which has the same kind of effect of defamiliarisation because there 's the feeling <#> It 's partly partly <,> you know the old feeling you can't see the wood for the trees <#> Uhm but that <,> if you 're used to always sort of seeing things in <.> par </.> particular conceptual terms uhm that it 's very very difficult to recognise what 's happening <#> So that quite often they use the uhm <,> you know this notion of the past as almost as if it was a journey into another kind of sphere <#> Uh but of course it raises the problem that people will not necessarily know how to read the novel and and that people tend to read historical novels in terms of their historical accuracy <,> because we still expect from the novel that degree of factual representation <,> so you can kind of say well <,> does he capture the speech of the people of the time <#> You know <#> Are the descriptions of dress <,> of clothing <,> of furniture <,> of mental attitudes <,> of assumptions <,> are they <,> you know <,> are they accurate <#> Uhm because again even with a novel which is deconstructing the notion of factual representation uhm people are still trained to read novels uhm and expect that kind of factual representation <,> <#> Now in order to to assess that you will probably need to be a historian almost <#> Or does it not matter<S1B-019$D> <#> I don't think it does <#> I mean <,> you just read it as a story <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> maybe to some people <unclear> several sylls </unclear> the whole detail <,> but you just take it as a story really<S1B-019$A> <#> Mm <#> Lots of people love Anthony Trollope 's novels even though some people think they 're dull and they like them because of of you know the accuracy of of the representation <#> So you don't need to read nineteenth-century history <,> all you need to do is read Anthony Trollope <#> You know it 's sort of <,> you know history sugared <,> sort of way <#> Much more palatable than reading blue books of parliamentary reports <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> Anyway <,> for those of you who have not read Fowles <,> do you think that you will<S1B-019$B> <#> Along with a hundred other ones<S1B-019$A> <#> Along with along with a hundred other ones <#> Okay <#> Well as I say at this stage maybe we can kind of uhm just have some sort of look at the way the uhm the term has gone <#> We 've managed to read one two three four five six <,> well at least we we we have we have discussed eight novels <break in tape> <#> So <,> has your experience then been just of being being overwhelmed<S1B-019$B> <#> <&> unclear </&><S1B-019$D> <#> I 've only got to read three books<S1B-019$A> <#> You 've only got to read three books for the exam<S1B-019$D> <#> Oh right <laughs><S1B-019$A> <#> But does that <,> but but but does that not uhm give you a feeling of frustration<S1B-019$D> <#> Yeah I wasn't thinking that way yeah <#> If I 'd <{> <[> had time I would like </[> to have read them<S1B-019$A> <#> <[> Yeah yeah </[> </{><S1B-019$A> <#> Yeah <#> So why do you say you only have to read three books<S1B-019$D> <#> No I just did <#> No that 's all I <{> <[> read yeah yeah </[><S1B-019$A> <#> <[> Oh yes </[> </{> that 's all you did yeah<S1B-019$B> <#> I think uh <,> the the <,> you know the idea that the exams are there you know oppresses like it 's it 's kind of <,> puts you off kind of <,> you know <,> or <#> It kind of puts pressure on you you know to <,> you know you have <,> there 's so much in each subject you can only do so much on each you know <#> And like the object of the course is to read as much as you can <,> and you know <,> get to know the different writers <.> ekcet </.> et-cetera <#> It 's hard to to do that <,> you know <#> It 's hard to get everything read <#> Because like essays and all as well you have to do<S1B-019$A> <#> What do you think would be the right thing to do <,> to vastly reduce the amount of things that are covered or <#> Because the other argument is that even if you can't get round to reading them you 're <,> you 're sort of introduced to them and you get to know maybe about things that <,> you know that you wouldn't<S1B-019$C> <#> It is valuable too <{> <[> You take notes at the lectures </[> and <,> get around to it sometime but still <,> you <.> certain </.> you do come out of most tutorials and lectures interested in actually reading them but <,> and really intending to but <,> you just never get the time because then you 're into your next one and you say <,> I 'd better leave that <#> So <,> I don't know if there 's any answer really<S1B-019$D> <#> <[> And then you can go and read it if you want to </[> </{><&> X-corpus student speaks </&><S1B-019$A> <#> What about the sense though that the course is also meant to give you some sort of sense of the development of <,> you know <,> of the novel <#> Uhm <,> have you have you kind of <,> have you got that yet or <,> are you having to wait til the end of the <{> <[> lecture course </[><S1B-019$B> <#> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <[> </{> <#> The way it 's gone backwards <,> you know you 're doing twentieth <,> then nineteenth and eighteenth <,> and that 's that 's difficult you know <#> If it was going the other way <,> it would be would be better I suppose<S1B-019$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-019$C> <#> You pick up something but <,> I don't know <#> I suppose one could end up the year to <,> say for sure<S1B-019$A> <#> See if <,> yeah <,> see if it makes any sense <#> The trouble about somebody like Fowles you see is is that <,> well it <,> I suppose like <,> most of these novelists <,> is that they are writing in response to other novelists <,> and it 's very very difficult to pick up everything unless you 've read the <,> you know <,> the thing that that they 're responding to <,> where they 're kind of saying <,> well you know <,> Jane Austen did it like this <,> but I don't actually think that that 's kind of getting at the heart of it so what I 'm going to do is rewrite that story with a different emphasis <,> you know <,> kind of putting in all of the things that she left out or focusing <,> you know not on the kind of the resolution or reconciliation with societal demands but on the impossibility of that kind of reconciliation <#> Now uhm I mean <,> I 'm not quite sure who else he would have been influenced by uh but Dickens I think very very clearly <#> I mean Fowles 's first novel The Magus uh is is a rewriting of Great Expectations <#> Well he said he was teaching Great Expectations at the time and it was sort of <,> stayed in the back of his mind <,> you know <,> all all of the time while he was writing the book and I think <,> can can you pick up enough <,> from reading a novel or should you be expected to <,> you know <,> to know all all sorts of things <,> you know <,> when you when you approach it <#> Even on on <,> I mean <,> or is it simply that there are different kinds of readings <,> and you read with kind of more or less uhm interest as you<S1B-019$D> <#> Great Expectations <&> several sylls </&><S1B-019$A> <#> Mm <#> What about the other idea <,> then <,> that used to be popular <,> which is that <,> all of these books should raise all sorts of questions that are relevant to you <#> You know <,> so that you read a book <,> you recognise an experience in it <,> and then that leads you on to <,> to debate the condition of the world <#> Does does that happen <#> I mean does that happen when you go out of here <#> You kind of say <,> well you know the questions that were raised there and that you you know you talk to each other about it<S1B-019$D> <#> Not really <&> laughs </&><S1B-019$B> <#> Well uh we like I think <,> like other students <,> you talk more <,> more so about novels than you do about any other part of the course like poetry or drama <#> You talk more about novels than <,> and you know what 's what 's really the point and that kind of <.> s </.> <,> you know <,> of each novel and things like that <,> so<S1B-019$A> <#> Yeah I 'm <,> I just think that nowadays people kind of seem to be less excited uhm about the kinds of issues that are raised and I wonder if it isn't the sort of you know the terrible pressure of trying to get <,> you know <,> trying to get results rather than kind of feeling a sense of space where <,> you know <,> where you can sort of <,> discuss existentialism until three o'clock in the morning <#> I mean does that happen any more <#> I don't get the impression that it does but it certainly used to <,><S1B-019$D> <#> People are more interested in talking about trivial things really</I>
