<S1B-067 Resignation query 2><I><S1B-067$A> <#> The impression being conveyed you see is that that he found the whole the whole of the situation very unpleasant because you were shouting at him and you were putting pressure on him <#> Did you try to pressurise him to change his opinion<S1B-067$B> <#> Oh yes <,> I did <#> I tried to get him to understand that the Duggan case was not a case of any significance whatever and that therefore it was not the bombshell which he appeared to think it was <#> But I <,> I had to <.> sa </.> I have to say <,> though I have great admiration for Mr Fitzsimons 's gifts and qualities <,> I have to say that I found him uhm somewhat unreceptive of the possibility that there might be another point of view <&> laughter </&><S1B-067$X> <X> Earlier Mr O'Dea asked Mr Russell if his office had ever instructed Mr Owen Fitzsimons in an extradition case </X><S1B-067$A> <#> Has your office ever instructed Mr Fitzsimons<S1B-067$B> <#> I do not believe so<S1B-067$A> <#> Have you ever encountered or have you often encountered Mr Fitzsimons on the defence side <{> <[> <,> in extradition </[> cases<S1B-067$B> <#> <[> I don't think </[> </{> <#> I I I I 'm <,> I don't think ever<S1B-067$A> <#> So there 's no <,> there 's no great evidence that Mr Fitzsimons 's knowledge or at least his experience in extradition law in any way approximates to yours<S1B-067$B> <#> Well Mr Fitzsimons is a very distinguished uh practitioner but I think his interests lie in the Chancery field and European Law<S1B-067$X> <X> When supplementary questions were put in the afternoon Donal Carey of Fine Gael asked if additional staff had been sought by the Attorney General 's office at any time Mr Russell said there had been an increase in staff </X><S1B-067$C> <#> Over the periods uh that this uh Smyth file was being considered <,> <.> ho </.> how did you work on holidays or what were the holiday arrangements in the in the uh <,> in the office <#> I I I heard for instance in the <.> Taois </.> <,> the Taoiseach in one of his replies to the Da/il uh saying that one of the officials was in the East Europe and couldn't be contacted <#> How was it <,> how <,> how are uh uh holidays arranged in the Attorney General 's office <,> or what what system have you <#> Is it a <,> a fifty-two week office or is it uh <,> does it close down <,> or what happens<S1B-067$A> <#> No uhm it doesn't close down except at night and <&> laughter </&> at weekends <#> Uh there 's always there <,> there always have to be staff there<S1B-067$X> <X> Derek McDowell pressed Mr Russell on the Ellis case Mr Russell said there could be no question of that case deciding the Smyth case </X><S1B-067$D> <#> What exceptional circumstances did you see in the Smyth case<S1B-067$B> <#> Well <,> that was one of the issues <,> because before the Attorney General could authorise uh an extradition <,> he would have to be satisfied that there were exceptional circumstances <#> Now the Oireachtas has given no guidance as to what it thought it meant when it inserted this provision in nineteen eighty-seven <#> Nor have <,> uh nor is there uh much assistance from the courts <,> and therefore it was a matter of trying to decide would there be in the Smyth case any matters which a court would be likely to hold were exceptional circumstances<S1B-067$D> <#> And do you have a view on that<S1B-067$B> <#> I had not <,> I had not formulated a view because as I 've uh made it plain <,> I I hope <,> I had not come to a conclusion about the Smyth case <#> At the time we were informed he was returning voluntarily to to Northern Ireland<S1B-067$X> <X> Michael McDowell of the Progressive Democrats pressed Mr Russell on whether or not he was willing to be questioned on the substance of the statement of fact in the Smyth case </X><S1B-067$B> <#> I repeat <,> I awaited direction from the Attorney General on the matter<S1B-067$X> <X> Later Mr McDowell asked Mr Russell if he was acquainted with Kilnacrott Abbey </X><S1B-067$E> <#> You you mentioned this morning that you weren't aware of a secondary school at Kilnacrott <#> I 've since learnt that a Deputy in this House of reasonably young vintage was educated there uh at the secondary school <#> Could I ask you <,> are you acquainted with Kilnacrott uh Abbey<S1B-067$B> <#> No<S1B-067$E> <#> At all<S1B-067$B> <#> No<S1B-067$E> <#> Uh are you acquainted with the uh or have you ever any <,> had any acquaintance or ever met the uh Abbott of Kilnacrott for the time being<S1B-067$B> <#> No and I don't think I 've ever met even a humble monk from that institution <&> laughter </&><S1B-067$E> <#> Well the reason the reason I ask you is that uh apparently he was he 's chaplain to a to a to to a uh an organisation in Dublin and I was wondering uhm could you have met him in that context<S1B-067$B> <#> What what organisation<S1B-067$E> <#> The Order of Saint Lazarus<S1B-067$B> <#> No I regret to say I 'm not a member or that organisation either <&> laughter </&><S1B-067$X> <X> Tony Gregory raised the matter of the allegation that the former Taoiseach Mr Reynolds sought the removal of Mr Russell from his position in the Attorney General 's office </X><S1B-067$F> <#> Can I ask you then to just for the record <,> were you prepared to to leave your position in the Attorney General 's office as a result of the message that had come from the Taoiseach<S1B-067$B> <#> Certainly I was aware of no reason whatever why I should and I still haven't been made aware of any reason why I should<S1B-067$F> <#> I I accept that you 've said that but can you answer the question that I that I 've asked <,> which is you know were you prepared <,> uh the other I 'm <,> I don't wish to press you on it other than the implication in this document which has been circulated to us is that you were prepared to go <#> Uh <,> it <,> I feel also that the implication is there that you were prepared to go but only if you could go quietly <{> <[> and </[> I 'm simply trying to uh to establish if that is the case is that a fair assessment of of <,> or a fair account of the exchange between yourself and Mr Fitzsimons<S1B-067$B> <#> <[> No </[> </{><S1B-067$B> <#> No I wasn't prepared to go <,> quietly or otherwise<S1B-067$X> <X> Before the Committee adjourned Mr Russell said he wished to correct an answer which he gave to a question from Willie O'Dea in the morning session <#> It related to his age when appointed to the Reid Professorship at Trinity College </X><S1B-067$B> <#> <.> I </.> if I might be permitted uhm Chairman to correct uh uh uh an answer I gave to uhm uh Deputy O'Dea today <,> this morning uhm when he asked me what age I was when I was uh uh appointed to a particular position <,> uh <.> i </.> in the heat of the moment I miscalculated <#> I was twenty-seven not thirty-three <#> Thank-you<S1B-067$A> <#> Thank-you</I>
