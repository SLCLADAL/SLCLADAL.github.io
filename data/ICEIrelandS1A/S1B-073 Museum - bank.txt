think there 's going to be you know you know football shirts and you <{5> <[5> know things </[5> to do <#> And <{6> <[6> there 's a big photography </[6> <,> uhm part of it as well<S1B-073$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1B-073$B> <#> <[2> Brilliant </[2> </{2><S1B-073$B> <#> <[3> Very good </[3> </{3><S1B-073$B> <#> <[4> Oh right yeah </[4> </{4><S1B-073$B> <#> <[5> Right </[5> </{5><S1B-073$B> <#> <[6> Oh that 'll be very good </[6> </{6><S1B-073$B> <#> I see<S1B-073$A> <#> And uh it should be <,> <{1> <[1> uhm like </[1> the dinosaurs there 's going to be a big activity area you know for kids you know so they can you know come not only and just look at the exhibition <,> <{2> <[2> but uhm </[2> you know <,> to look you know there 's activities <{3> <[3> going </[3> on to do with football <#> <{4> <[4> Uhm </[4><S1B-073$B> <#> <[1> Is this uh </[1> </{1><S1B-073$B> <#> <[2> Mhm </[2> </{2><S1B-073$B> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1B-073$B> <#> <[4> That 's very </[4> </{4> good <#> Is it Northern Ireland <,> Football Association has something to do <{> <[> with this </[><S1B-073$A> <#> <[> Uhm yeah the </[> </{> <#> Well there it 's really yeah it would be <,> based on them <,> but uhm there 's other you know exhibits as well from other clubs in over you know in uh England<S1B-073$B> <#> Football clubs<S1B-073$A> <#> Football <{> <[> clubs </[> yeah<S1B-073$B> <#> <[> Very </[> </{> good <#> <{> <[> Very good </[><S1B-073$A> <#> <[> Hopefully </[> </{> anyway <#> I 'm not too I 'm not totally sure but I think that 's the way it 's <,> <{> <[> it 's leading </[><S1B-073$B> <#> <[> When </[> </{> <,> sorry when uh when is uh <,> this starting this <,> <{> <[> on </[><S1B-073$A> <#> <[> June </[> </{> <,> <{1> <[1> June </[1> the let 's see June the seventeenth <#> <{2> <[2> It 's running right </[2> through to January <,> <{3> <[3> next year </[3><S1B-073$B> <#> <[1> June </[1> </{1><S1B-073$B> <#> <[2> Right this is <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> </[2> </{2><S1B-073$B> <#> <[3> Is that I think </[3> </{3> that might be the start of the World Cup <,> <{> <[> the very day the World </[> Cup starts<S1B-073$A> <#> <[> Mhm mhm </[> </{><S1B-073$A> <#> Is that is that the day it <{> <[> starts <#> Right </[><S1B-073$B> <#> <[> Yeah I think </[> </{> it is <#> It 's the fifteenth or the seventeenth<S1B-073$A> <#> Uh-huh<S1B-073$B> <#> Very good <#> Very good<S1B-073$A> <#> So that 's what that 's the big one for the summer <{> <[> anyway </[><S1B-073$B> <#> <[> I think </[> </{> I think it 's a nice change to have something like that <{> <[> something relevant </[><S1B-073$A> <#> <[> Mm well </[> </{> this is the first time a football <{> <[> exhibition 's </[> actually been actually has been done <,> in the museum before <#> So it 's sort of like a first <,> for us<S1B-073$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1B-073$B> <#> I think that 's a good idea too cos it 'll start bringing in some young people <{> <[> into the museum whereas you know <,> before I think <,> a lot of young people 'll get bored with it </[><S1B-073$A> <#> <[> Mhm mhm <#> Well that 's what that 's what 's they were trying to do <#> Trying to bring </[> </{> <,> yeah trying to bring in sort of a different uhm sort of group of people that <{1> <[1> would </[1> usually come you know <#> Cos most of the time it be <,> either families you know young children to see the dinosaurs or sort of you know uhm older people who want to come and see the uhm art <{2> <[2> exhibitions and that </[2> <#> So uhm it would be bringing a lot<S1B-073$B> <#> <[1> Right </[1> </{1><S1B-073$B> <#> <[2> Yeah <,> that 's right </[2> </{2><S1B-073$B> <#> I was in here I was in here about a year ago <{1> <[1> and uhm </[1> I was interested about this you know Irish History <,> section <{2> <[2> upstairs you know </[2> volunteers and stuff you know<S1B-073$A> <#> <[1> Mhm </[1> </{1><S1B-073$A> <#> <[2> Mhm mhm </[2> </{2><S1B-073$A> <#> Oh right<S1B-073$B> <#> Which was very good because when uhm I was studying I studied Irish History A level<S1B-073$A> <#> Mhm<S1B-073$B> <#> And uhm when I got round to looking a lot of the stuff was very very <.> rel </.> see it was very relevant to what I was studying <#> <{1> <[1> You know </[1> like as in <,> I mean the battles and stuff there <{2> <[2> was all </[2> all the gear there you know <#> And if I had 've knew it was there when I was studying like <{3> <[3> I would 've definitely came up you know </[3> <,> <#> It was a bit unfortunate like <,> <#> But uh<S1B-073$A> <#> <[1> Mhm </[1> </{1><S1B-073$A> <#> <[2> Mhm </[2> </{2><S1B-073$A> <#> <[3> Mhm mhm mhm </[3> </{3><S1B-073$A> <#> Right<S1B-073$B> <#> <{> <[> But uhm </[> <S1B-073$A> <#> <[> How </[> </{> did you come across it then <#> Just by<S1B-073$B> <#> Oh I just I just came in cos I 'm <{1> <[1> <,,> actually </[1> I 'm a student down in Queen 's you know <{2> <[2> so </[2> I just <,> took a day off or whatever and <{3> <[3> took </[3> a dander round you know <{4> <[4> so </[4><S1B-073$A> <#> <[1> Just to have a look at it </[1> </{1><S1B-073$A> <#> <[2> Right </[2> </{2><S1B-073$A> <#> <[3> Uh-huh </[3> </{3><S1B-073$A> <#> <[4> Uh-huh </[4> </{4> you didn't know what was here before<S1B-073$B> <#> I hadn't a clue what was here <#> Hadn't a clue <&> laughter </&> <#> <{> <[> Hadn't a clue </[><S1B-073$A> <#> <[> Huh </[> </{> <,> and you were surprised<S1B-073$B> <#> Yeah I was indeed <#> I was indeed <#> I was indeed</I><I><S1B-073$C> <#> And then you get your Visa<S1B-073$D> <#> I <,> you get a Visa card<S1B-073$C> <#> Mhm<S1B-073$D> <#> Automatically<S1B-073$C> <#> Well <,> when I say <.> aut </.> <{> <[> it means you 've to apply for it </[> <#> You apply for it <#> I mean medical students and dental students are the only students<S1B-073$D> <#> <[> You apply for it yeah </[> </{><S1B-073$D> <#> Now that 's I 've got a Visa card with the Northern so I have to close that as well<S1B-073$C> <#> Well what we 've done with others is you can actually we can re-order we can order your new one <#> And then when you get the new one and you 've paid off the old one just cut it up because it 's the same <#> At the end of the day <,> it 's the same sort of central source <#> <{> <[> Visa </[> is Visa<S1B-073$D> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><S1B-073$D> <#> Yeah<S1B-073$C> <#> But you might as well have a Bank of Ireland Visa because it 's <#> Because when you graduate then you 're eligible for the Affinity card <#> Have you seen that <#> <{> <[> With the Queen 's </[><S1B-073$D> <#> <[> The one with </[> </{> the Queen 's <{> <[> stuff on it </[><S1B-073$C> <#> <[> Yeah mhm </[> </{> <,> which is <{> <[> two percent </[> cheaper<S1B-073$D> <#> <[> It gives </[> </{><S1B-073$D> <#> And does it give money to <{> <[> Queen 's you know </[><S1B-073$C> <#> <[> It gives </[> </{> four pounds to Queen 's every time somebody takes <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> They 're lovely cards <unclear> several syllables </unclear><S1B-073$D> <#> Oh it is <#> Isn't it very nice <#> Nice<S1B-073$C> <#> So only if you 're now <.> i </.> you don't have to be a Bank of Ireland customer<S1B-073$D> <#> Mhm<S1B-073$C> <#> You can be a staff member or a graduate <{> <[> but uhm or or a <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[><S1B-073$D> <#> <[> Because the the Visa card doesn't </[> </{> actually have any connection to the account sure it doesn't particularly<S1B-073$C> <#> No<S1B-073$D> <#> They <{> <[> they 're not </[><S1B-073$C> <#> <[> Although </[> </{> we can get it you know set up so it 's cleared from your account <{> <[> direct debit <#> That 's true </[><S1B-073$D> <#> <[> Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh </[> </{> uh-huh <#> Aye normally the Visa card comes out whenever <&> laughter </&> there 's no other money about<S1B-073$C> <#> Exactly <#> I know exactly <{> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[><S1B-073$D> <#> <[> And the overdraft 's up </[> </{> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear><S1B-073$C> <#> I prefer to choose rather than having just to make it exactly <&> laughter </&> <#> What you might find in fourth year or especially final year <{1> <[1> you 're </[1> away from home <,> then you could miss a payment <,> <{2> <[2> so </[2> it 's a very handy way of doing it and you<S1B-073$D> <#> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1><S1B-073$D> <#> <[2> Mhm </[2> </{2><S1B-073$D> <#> Yes <{> <[> if you do have the loan and everything <#> Yeah </[><S1B-073$C> <#> <[> And <,> and you and you have the loan <#> Exactly </[> </{> <#> So it would never not be paid <{> <[> <#> Cos </[> if it 's Bank of Ireland on this loan we 'd send it back you know so<S1B-073$D> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{><S1B-073$D> <#> Mhm mhm<S1B-073$C> <#> So it works out very well <#> A lot of them have done that <#> And then when you actually start working you can cancel that <,> and then decide whether you 're going to pay it yourself<S1B-073$D> <#> Mhm<S1B-073$C> <#> And how much you know <#> They 're great to have<S1B-073$D> <#> So uhm what was I going to say <#> Yes about <,> to opening the account <{> <[> what way </[> do you<S1B-073$C> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{><S1B-073$C> <#> It 's very simple you know <#> Just fill in <{> <[> a load </[> of forms and <&> laughter </&> <,> you know <#> But what we can do I mean you 've two other accounts which must be hard enough to manage<S1B-073$D> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> <&> laughter </&><S1B-073$D> <#> Well it 's just it is <{1> <[1> actually </[1> but if uh it 's just that I never got round to changing <{2> <[2> I mean over from </[2><S1B-073$C> <#> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1><S1B-073$C> <#> <[2> From your home </[2> </{2> I know<S1B-073$D> <#> Well no <#> It <.> wa </.> it it was uhm I was quite happy <#> Yes because they 're both there it was <{1> <[1> more </[1> awkward even to close them <,> <{2> <[2> to go </[2> in and to go and sort of change my student loan just to one I I would 've changed all just to First <{3> <[3> Trust </[3> except that I had to <,> I had the student loans coming to Northern because<S1B-073$C> <#> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1><S1B-073$C> <#> <[2> I know </[2> </{2><S1B-073$C> <#> <[3> Mhm </[3> </{3><S1B-073$C> <#> I know <#> <{> <[> Definitely </[> very complicated<S1B-073$D> <#> <[> Well </[> </{><S1B-073$D> <#> Yes <&> laughter </&> yes <#> And then you consider I 've got two accounts in each so <{> <[> I 've actually got four accounts </[> <&> laughter </&><S1B-073$C> <#> <[> I know <#> I know <#> That 's too much to </[> </{> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> <#> The last thing you want to do anyway is add another to the collection<S1B-073$D> <#> No<S1B-073$C> <#> So really if you were happy enough<S1B-073$D> <#> Oh yeah I would <{> <[> just </[><S1B-073$C> <#> <[> Now what </[> </{> we can do and it 's up to yourself some people would like to go in and face-to-face close the

on<S1B-073$D> <#> Mhm<S1B-073$C> <#> What way your account is</I>
