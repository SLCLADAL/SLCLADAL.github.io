<S1B-005 Byzantium 2><I><S1B-005$A> <#> When did that evolve and become statute <,> or is it just there from <,> dot you know Christ <#> You know what I mean<S1B-005$B> <#> Well no it 's not <{> <[> just there </[><S1B-005$A> <#> <[> Or is it a </[> </{> fusion of different things <{> <[> you know </[><S1B-005$B> <#> <[> Well it 's </[> </{> a fusion of different things <#> And <,> alright cos what just <&> laughter </&> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> what does Christ say about divorce<S1B-005$?> <#> <unclear> several words </unclear> <&> laughter </&><S1B-005$B> <#> He actually says that<S1B-005$A> <#> <unclear> several words </unclear><S1B-005$B> <#> Yeah he actually says that there shouldn't be any<S1B-005$A> <#> Mm<S1B-005$B> <#> Right now the thing to remember is that <,> Jesus was brought up as a Jew and was acting as a rabbi <,> a teacher <,> and <,> was actually <,> answering questions on Jewish law <#> Right <#> And does Jewish law allow divorce <#> The answer to that is yes it does<S1B-005$C> <#> Really<S1B-005$A> <#> Yep <#> Alright <#> The things you learn <&> laughter </&><S1B-005$C> <#> I didn't know that<S1B-005$D> <#> I didn't either <#> I <{> <[> thought </[> Jews 'd always been very like <,> stringently against divorce<S1B-005$B> <#> <[> Yes <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[> </{><S1B-005$B> <#> Uhm no there is uh now it it tends to be <,> very rigorously well <,> nowadays it 's very rigorously defined because most Jews <,> follow <,> traditions that derive to some extent from the Rabbinic <,> tradition of Judaism which in Jesus ' time equates with the Pharisees <#> Okay <#> And nowadays if you want to get a <,> divorce according to <&Hebrew> halacha </&Hebrew> which is Jewish law you get what 's called a a <&Hebrew> get </&Hebrew> <,> which is a bill of divorcement <#> And this bill of divorcement has to be written exactly <,> in <,> thirteen lines I think <#> Anyway there 's a specific number of lines that it must be written in and it all must be you know done exactly like this <#> And the nasty part is that only the man can do the divorcing <#> <{> <[> Alright so </[><S1B-005$D> <#> <[> Mm mm sorry I asked </[> </{> that particular question<S1B-005$B> <#> He he actually presents the bill of divorcement to <,> her erstwhile wife <#> And that 's why in orthodox Jewish communities you get things called <,> uhm <,> well it would be <&Hebrew> agunot </&Hebrew> which are chained women <,> because they 're chained because their husband has <,> left them but he hasn't actually divorced them according to Jewish law which means that they can't remarry according to Jewish law <#> Right <#> Which if you 're a devout Jew <,> is clearly a problem <#> But so <,> Jesus in his teaching was actually more extreme <,> than the Jewish tradition in which he was sort of operating <#> Alright <#> Because he actually said you know they allow <,> divorce but I say to you there should be no divorce <#> Right <#> Now <,> how quickly did that well I mean then you have to get from the teachings of Jesus to <,> something that resembles <,> established Christianity <#> And I mean that takes three centuries to do roughly <#> Okay <,> so fast forward to three thirty AD which is a useful point in time but nothing more <#> And by that stage <,> Christianity is more prevalent in <,> the Roman Empire than Judaism <,> had been <,> because Judaism constituted approximately one to two percent of the population of the Roman Empire <,> whereas Christianity in about three thirty constituted approximately ten percent <,> of the population <,> nine or ten percent<S1B-005$C> <#> Peter the<S1B-005$B> <#> Mm hm<S1B-005$C> <#> How did the Jews you 've been describing the Rabbi <,> how come it 's only two percent<S1B-005$B> <#> It 's a uh well <&> laughter </&> <#> Sorry I 'm I 'm <.> n </.> not laughing at the question <#> The simple answer is Saint Paul<S1B-005$C> <#> Saint Paul<S1B-005$B> <#> Saint Paul <#> Well I mean okay but right<S1B-005$A> <#> He took up the mantle<S1B-005$B> <#> Yes <#> And I mean if you actually think about the New Testament <,> exhibit A <,> which is <,> a copy of the Bible <,> <#> Right<S1B-005$A> <#> So then <{1> <[1> Christ said the word </[1> of <,> as a as a Rabbi <,> Jew <{2> <[2> <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> </[2> and Paul interpreted that and changed it into Christianity<S1B-005$B> <#> <[1> That <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[1> </{1><S1B-005$B> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1B-005$B> <#> Right well what <,> right the the this <,> right if you if <{> <[> if you look </[><S1B-005$A> <#> <[> I know </[> </{> nothing about the Bible as you <{> <[> can tell </[> <&> laughter </&><S1B-005$B> <#> <[> Right well </[> </{> basically the the the Gospels right there are four Gospels <,> and then there are the Acts of the Apostles <#> Right <#> And those <,> come from well those supposedly recount the mission of Christ on earth and then the Acts of the Apostles curiously enough the disciples afterwards <#> Then you get all the <,> epistles and most of the epistles<&> break in tape </&><S1B-005$B> <#> But Boswell also stops to wonder what sort of relationship it was <#> He finds clarification by Basil 's subsequent <,> career with the hunk approving <,> Theopolitsis <#> Right <#> Theopolitsis is a courtier <,> who <,> sees Basil <,> and goes <,> that 's a bit of alright <#> I 'll have some of that <&> laughter </&> and takes him into his service as a groom <#> And then comes the horse-whisperer episode <,> when there 's a horse that nobody can calm down and Basil is summoned in to do it and does it <#> And then he comes to the attention of <{> <[> of </[> the Emperor <,> right <,> Michael the Third<S1B-005$A> <#> <[> Of </[> </{><S1B-005$A> <#> Can I ask you Peter in all the literature that 's been written <,> do they talk about normal sex ever <#> I mean the the actual sex do they talk about between man men and women<S1B-005$D> <#> <{> <[> Normal </[><S1B-005$B> <#> <[> Uhm </[> </{> <&> laughter </&><S1B-005$A> <#> You know what I mean<S1B-005$B> <#> <{> <[> Well </[><S1B-005$D> <#> <[> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[> </{> accepted<S1B-005$A> <#> It 's not accepting I mean just I mean is it reported <#> I mean is it is this absence of <,> reported sex between this <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> you know thing <,> would that be because it just really wasn't talked about at all<S1B-005$B> <#> Part of it would be that<S1B-005$A> <#> Could that be just a normal sex thing going on and they didn't talk about that this was what was happening<S1B-005$B> <#> It 's right on an awful lot of our sources right an awful lot of Byzantine sources are actually religious sources <,> and curiously enough they don't actually talk about sex very much <#> Right <#> So that means that our body of sources sort of <,> are reduced <#> There are some sources <,> from the eleventh and twelfth century I think specifically of what of there are things called the Romances <#> There are novels <#> And there 's a thing called <,> Digenis Akritas which is sort of the <,> the derring-do <,> adventures of <,> well Digenis Akritas means <,> twice born the border or <#> And that 's this guy who lives on the eastern frontier and he has a whole series of adventures because his <,> mummy is a Christian but his daddy is Muslim and that 's he 's born from the two traditions <#> And he has lots and lots of adventures about getting a girl <,> and uhm <,> keeping the girl and almost losing the girl <#> And <,> he rapes an Amazon on the way past <#> And you know there 's all this <,> stuff going on <#> So sometimes they talk about <,> sex a little bit there but at the same time it tends to be a little bit <,> elusive <#> So you tend not to get <,> you know <{> <[> <,> they disappeared into the forest </[> and had sex <#> You tend not to get that<S1B-005$A> <#> <[> But I think they </[> </{><S1B-005$A> <#> A bit vague<S1B-005$B> <#> It 's a bit vague<S1B-005$A> <#> And because maybe because religion a lot of religious <,> a lot of it when they do talk about like even somebody 's character <,> and they 're trying to pull them down through their sexual exploits or whatever it 's all negative <#> Like it 's all the worst of the worst and <{1> <[1> intrigue </[1> and mistresses and <#> You know you don't get a routine just two people having a relationship and going about their business <#> You know <#> It 's it 's all the other stuff all <,> because <,> maybe because it 's like well religious people generally are <,> very <,> <{2> <[2> anti-sex </[2> <&> laughter </&> <#> You know <,> it 's always got to be involved in some other kind of <{3> <[3> plot </[3> or or you know <,> mystique or something<S1B-005$B> <#> <[1> Mm hm </[1> </{1><S1B-005$D> <#> <[2> Religious </[2> </{2><S1B-005$B> <#> <[3> Yes </[3> </{3><S1B-005$B> <#> Because the other thing is that obviously within Byzantine culture <,> there 's actually a very strong tradition that <,> asceticism is best <,> and that sort of celibacy and <,> you know <,,> you only sort of you know did it once a quarter when you lie back and think of Byzantium and you never do it <{> <[> otherwise <#> You know </[><S1B-005$A> <#> <[> For the sake </[> </{> of procreation<S1B-005$B> <#> Yeah <,> <#> So there is that <,> then <,> in part that 's probably <,> a function of the kind of sources that 've survived <#> Uhm because most of the Byzantine sources that we have <,> were saved by being kept in their monastery <#> So they 're actually you know coming from monastic storerooms and things <#> And so that means that <,> anything that would be a little bit dubious here <.> ju </.> juicy <,> they wouldn't 've kept <,> right or might not 've kept<S1B-005$D> <#> Not having anything explicit as far as heterosexuality is concerned makes it just totally impossible to compare it then you know with homosexuality<S1B-005$A> <#> I never <{> <[> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[><S1B-005$B> <#> <[> It makes it </[> </{> very very difficult <#> Right <#> And <,> a lot of people would actually say but because <,,> you know <,> you can't get you know <,> confessions of a Byzantine lesbian <&> laughter </&> confessions of of a Byzantine gay man <,> right well that means that in actual fact you shouldn't you know I shouldn't be teaching this module<S1B-005$D> <#> No it 'll be <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> as well <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-005$B> <#> Yes probably <#> And I mean that 's one of the things that that <,> okay you know <,> to the extent that there is a political agenda going on in the module <#> It 's that even though we don't have neat tidy sources that we can just go and look up <,> and flick over as we go and look there it is and sort of work out that you know seventeen point eight percent <&> laughter </&> did such and such two point five percent did such and such and the test sample <,> is you know <,> uhm ten thousand people which constitutes so many percent of the total Byzantine population for the thousand years of you know <#> We don't have any of that <#> Right <#> So that means that probably as far as as sort of the <,> uhm <,> Economic and Social Science Faculty down the road it 's sort of you know oh well it 's all meaningless then <#> Right <#> But then <,> because <,> it is a kind of <,> history that should be there <,> and it was part of experience we actually need to look at how we look at the sources <,> and then ask the questions of exactly how far can we push <,> the sources and what sort of questions can we ask them <#> And that 's<S1B-005$D> <#> Yeah the thing I <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> A lot of people are ignored and and written out of things <#> I think in those days it 's just that <,> sex was just written out <#> So it wasn't anything to do with homosexuals or heterosexuals <,> just sex<S1B-005$B> <#> A <.> l </.> a lot of that is true <#> Now <,> part of it where where it sort of <,> where that argument tends to fall down is that there are collections of what are known as penitentials <#> And those are the the the penalty rates for all the Christian sins <#> And <,> sometimes they can be quite A explicit and B go into more detail than <{> <[> you think is </[><S1B-005$A> <#> <[> Than you </[> </{> need to know <&> laughter </&><S1B-005$B> <#> Well than you think is healthy <#> For some reason Father confessors uhm <,> I mean some of the famous ones actually come from Ireland uhm <,> which obviously little Irish monks sitting alone <,> <&> laughter </&> on a little island <,> in the middle of of a <{1> <[1> law </[1> <,> decided you know I 've got to do something to kill my time <&> laughter </&> <#> And so they write these things that you know and there there 's you know there 's a whole scale of penalties <#> And you know <,> oral sex for <{2> <[2> the first time </[2> counts for so and so and oral sex you know more than once counts for so much and you know <#> It 's all <,> listed out <#> Now <,> the Byzantines have penitentials as well <,> but they tend not to be quite so explicit <,> or quite so detailed <,> but at the same time they do actually make distinctions <#> Uhm and so they will you know they will have penalties for <,> fornication and penalties for sodomy and penalties for oral sex and <,> you know <,> the rest of it<S1B-005$D> <#> <[1> Craggy Rock </[1> </{1><S1B-005$?> <#> <[2> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>
