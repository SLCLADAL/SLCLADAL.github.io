<S1B-065 Police evidence><I><S1B-065$B> <#> And what time did you arrive at the scene <#> Was it soon after the accident happened<S1B-065$A> <#> It was just shortly before seven pm<S1B-065$B> <#> And again can you simply describe the scene to His Lordship as to what you found when you were there<S1B-065$A> <#> Uhm as we drove up Springhill Park from the town centre direction uhm to approaching the junction to our right which would be into the cul-de-sac uhm I observed a large crowd of people gathered around a green Nova car <#> Uhm when I dismounted my vehicle and was approaching the vehicle uhm I observed a female uhm strike two other females <,> towards the rear off-side of this this car <#> Uhm I also noticed that the driver 's door was open and that there was a male person uhm having a dispute with the driver of the vehicle <#> Uhm fearing for the safety of the driver uhm I went over and advised the people there to stay back and let the police deal with the matter and I escorted the driver of the vehicle into a police vehicle for his own safety<S1B-065$B> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> identify the two people that were uhm <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-065$A> <#> Uhm the <,> the two ladies were being assaulted by the mother of the defendant and uhm the person I <.> lee </.> believed to be the father was the person that was having the the confrontation with the driver of the vehicle<S1B-065$B> <#> So had you ascertained that it had been an accident that had occurred sometime previously<S1B-065$A> <#> Yes it was reported to the police as an injury accident and that the offending vehicle had left the scene<S1B-065$B> <#> Did you speak to the defendant about leaving the scene<S1B-065$A> <#> Sorry say it again<S1B-065$B> <#> Did <,> did you speak to the defendant driver about why he 'd left the scene of the accident<S1B-065$A> <#> Uhm <,> on arrival of the police at the scene <,> obviously the the driver of the other vehicle had returned and we say <,> due to the hostile situation at the at the time uhm the police wished to get him offside so <,> for his own safety and also too <,> the crowd were quite hostile towards the police initially on arrival <#> Our uhm main task at hand was to get the sketch and that prepared at the time and to deal with the matter back at the station<S1B-065$B> <#> And did <,> sorry did you ascertain from him why he had left the scene of the accident previously<S1B-065$A> <#> Well he wasn't aware that he had left the scene of the accident <,> and obviously he 'd left and come back but he wasn't aware that it was reported as a hit-and-run accident <#> He 'd wasn't aware of that fact <#> As far as he 's concerned he had spoke to the <,> the uhm <,> ascertained the child was okay and as far as he 's concerned there 's no reason why the police would want to speak to him <,> in relation to this matter<S1B-065$B> <#> And <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> any charge in respect of leaving the scene<S1B-065$A> <#> Uh not <.> tha </.> <#> No there 's no charges made in relation to that<S1B-065$B> <#> Now did you then speak to the uhm uhm girl that was injured <,> the young plaintiff and <,> and and to her mother<S1B-065$A> <#> Uhm not at the time <,> no <#> Uhm she was receiving medical treatment and it was sometime later on that evening at about twenty past ten that night that I called round to the house again to speak with the parents and to check on the condition of the young girl<S1B-065$B> <#> And can you recall what was said to you about what happened <,> the circumstances of the accident<S1B-065$A> <#> Basically I went uhm into the house identified myself I was the police officer that had been there earlier on uhm informed them of what action the police had taken to date in relation to the accident <,> namely uhm we had interviewed all the witnesses known to the police at the time and uhm inquired about the condition of the girl and uhm <,> in fact uhm mentioned to her you know that we had interviewed everyone that we knew that had witnessed the accident or knew anything about the accident<S1B-065$B> <#> And what was your response <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear><S1B-065$A> <#> Uhm response <,> well <,> neither the mother nor the father made any indication that they had seen the accident or had been party to anything that happened immediately after the time of the accident<S1B-065$B> <#> We 've heard the evidence of the mother today where she gives the impression of actually being at the scene of the accident very soon after <#> She 's given evidence for the position of the defendant 's vehicle on the road et-cetera <#> Is that the impression that you obtained from her at the time<S1B-065$A> <#> I certainly got speaking to the both parents in the house that evening uhm <,> I was of the the belief that uhm the mother was in the house at the time of the accident and was alerted by a neighbour and at no time was any mention made to me of her seeing vehicles on the wrong side of the road or anything else<&> unclear speech from barrister to judge </&><S1B-065$B> <#> Uh sorry <,> did you interview then the daughter in respect of the accident<S1B-065$A> <#> No she was interviewed by Constable Callan<S1B-065$B> <#> Did you have a a look at these bicycles that had caused the accident<S1B-065$A> <#> I did <#> Yes the bicycle was pointed out to me which was lying in the front garden of the house <#> Uhm<S1B-065$B> <#> Were the other bicycles there<S1B-065$A> <#> I 'm not aware of any other bicycles <#> I couldn't honestly say whether there was or<S1B-065$B> <#> <unclear> several words </unclear><S1B-065$A> <#> I couldn't answer that question<S1B-065$B> <#> What would you say to His Lordship about the condition of the bicycle that you saw<S1B-065$A> <#> Uhm the bicycle pointed out to me uhm had substantial damage to the front forks <#> It was bent back and the front wheel was obviously bent back against the <,> the frame of the bicycle <#> Uhm I did check <,> and I 'm informed by the mother that the brakes weren't working <#> I did check the brakes on the back wheel which <,> I found whenever I spun the wheel and checked both <.> le </.> the brake lever <,> the wheel continued to spin and there was no pads sufficient to slow down the back wheel<S1B-065$B> <#> Can I just take you back a point <#> You said that you had been told about the condition of the bike <#> Who had told you about the condition<S1B-065$A> <#> Uhm it was the mother of the child who told me when I went to the house<S1B-065$B> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> then suggested to the mother that she said that you might have told her<S1B-065$A> <#> No I didn't <#> No she informed me of the fact of <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear><S1B-065$B> <#> And what would you also say about the size of the bike<S1B-065$A> <#> Uhm <,> in my view the bike would be for a teenager as opposed to a ten or eleven year old child<S1B-065$B> <#> Why is that<S1B-065$A> <#> Because of the size of the frame on the bike <#> I 'd have presumed it to be used by an older child than the child that was using it<S1B-065$B> <#> Had you gone down to the scene of the accident where the uhm the accident occurred <,> down at the junction <,> down at the junction in the photographs that you 're holding holding there<S1B-065$A> <#> Yes I was at the scene whenever we initially arrived at the accident<S1B-065$B> <#> Did you take notice of any tyre tread mark that had been <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> grass<S1B-065$A> <#> Yes <#> I I did yes uh-huh <#> Uhm it was on the grass to the right as you turn into the junction <,> <#> Uhm yes to the right on on photograph three there just as you turn into the junction<S1B-065$B> <#> And roughly how far was that on <,> in <,> in to the ground area<S1B-065$A> <#> Uhm it was on the edge of the grass just where the <,> the main curve is on the kerb <#> It would have been in that area there <#> It just <,> uhm <,> it 's somewhere round that area of the th' actual kerb where the turn in the kerb is there<S1B-065$B> <#> From speaking to the parties who gave evidence where did you believe the accident had taken place<S1B-065$A> <#> Uhm <,> that 's where I believe the accident did take place<S1B-065$B> <#> Did you take a statement from the defendant<S1B-065$A> <#> No I didn't <,> o <#> I spoke to a witness that was at the scene <,> Mr McMillan<S1B-065$B> <#> Thank-you<S1B-065$C> <#> Constable <,> uhm <,> the reporting officer was Constable Callan <#> Is that right<S1B-065$A> <#> That 's correct My Lord<S1B-065$C> <#> And he was in charge of investigating the <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <#> Is that right<S1B-065$A> <#> That 's correct My Lord<S1B-065$C> <#> <unclear> several words </unclear><S1B-065$A> <#> That 's correct My Lord<S1B-065$C> <#> And <,> you say that uh you were present in the minor 's house after the accident<S1B-065$A> <#> That was later on <,> about twenty past ten that evening<S1B-065$C> <#> That 's uh September ninety-seven<S1B-065$A> <#> That 's correct My Lord yes<S1B-065$C> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-065$A> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-065$C> <#> And uhm do you have a notebook entry there <,> number seven <#> Entry number seven<S1B-065$A> <#> Uhm I don't have everything that was said in my notebook obviously My Lord <#> Uhm <,> as I say I spoke to certain people on that day and ascertained who had seen what in relation to the accident<S1B-065$C> <#> Do you have the notebook there<S1B-065$A> <#> I do have <#> Yes <,,><S1B-065$C> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> the responsibility for the investigation of the facts fell on Constable Callan<S1B-065$A> <#> That would be correct <#> He was in charge of investigating the accident <#> I was just overseeing the investigation My Lord<S1B-065$C> <#> But it was your <,> you were involved in relation to the uh <,> possibility of prosecuting Mrs Hegarty for the assault<S1B-065$A> <#> No <#> Constable Callan was involved in that as well My Lord<S1B-065$C> <#> Were you present uh during the investigation in relation to the assault<S1B-065$A> <#> I was yes <#> That was the following day <,,><S1B-065$C> <#> And <,> I won't read all of it out <,> but it 's fair to say that you 've dedicated a page and a half to tell setting out the details <,> the nature of the assault <,> who was struck on what part of the body <,> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> Is that correct<S1B-065$A> <#> That 's correct My Lord <#> Yes<S1B-065$C> <#> And then preceding that <,> you have got a paragraph which says <,> informed of RTA <,> of injury RTA <,> Springhill Park where girl knocked off bicycle <#> <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> offending vehicle alleged to have drove off <,> eight eight DL o nine six seven <,> uh Cavalier uh <,> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <,> injured party <,> uh believed a minor <,> Thomas Sean Maguire <#> That 's your entry as regards your initial knowledge of the accident <#> Is that right<S1B-065$A> <#> That 's correct My Lord <#> Yes<S1B-065$C> <#> And <,> obviously the report which came into the police station was to that effect <,> that the child had been knocked off the bicycle and was then taken to the hospital <#> That was what you had in your mind that you wanted to investigate <#> Is that right<S1B-065$A> <#> That 's correct My Lord <#> Yes<S1B-065$C> <#> And thereafter then you dedicate some detail to what you saw as regards the assault and uh <unclear> several sylls </unclear> how you would have identified the assault to the plaintiff <#> Is that right<S1B-065$A> <#> That 's correct My Lord <#> Yes<S1B-065$C> <#> And thereafter <,> uh <,> the <,> uh injured party <,> Sean Maguire <,> one two two Springhill Park who was at home being attended to by ambulance personnel <#> That 's really all you have in the notebook as regards <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear><S1B-065$A> <#> Yes that 's correct <#> I didn't speak to the injured party at the time</I>
