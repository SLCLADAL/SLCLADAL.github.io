<S2A-053 Home improvement><I><S2A-053$A> <#> When Matthew asked for a treehouse his dad had a problem <#> Despite being a well-known and experienced architect <,> it looked like this challenge might be insurmountable <#> There wasn't a tree in the garden that was big enough <#> Undaunted <,> dad came up with the solution <#> He decided to build a free-standing house <,> but wedged between two trees <#> He is so proud of it that he even refused to move house because that would have meant leaving it behind <#> Most kids would love a treehouse <,> but with so many people living in houses with new gardens <,> finding a tree that 's suitable can be a problem<S2A-053$B> <X> <#> Hey Mister <,> I want a treehouse </X><S2A-053$A> <#> Well I don't have a tree to build it in <,> but if I build you a treeless treehouse <,> will that do <#> So how do you build yourself a treeless treehouse <#> First you need a garden shed or a kids ' playhouse <#> Mine 's just been delivered and is being put together at the moment <#> This children 's playhouse has had the front wall shifted back about a foot to create this little veranda <#> And very nice indeed <#> A small garden shed with the front wall flush to the front would do just as well <#> If you really want to impress those kids you 're going to have to lift this house off the ground <,> and to do that you 're going to need to put it up on stilts <#> Whoooooo <#> I 'm using five foot lengths of three inch by three inch spruce <,,> <#> And it will take six stilts to carry the weight of the shed <#> Make up a frame like this using cross members for added support <#> You could nail the frame together but to avoid splitting the timbers <,> pre-drill the holes and use brass screws which won't rust <#> It 's important to remember that the width and length of the frame need to be less than the base of the shed <#> You need to allow for twice the thickness of the plinth in order for the floor to fit over the stilts and the distance from the top of the stilts to the first beam should be the same as the depth of the plinth in order that the base of the shed can rest on this frame <#> Dig six holes about eighteen inches deep which allows you six inches for gravel on which to level the posts <,,> <#> Apply your preservative to the base of your posts prior to placing them in the holes <,> paying particular attention to the end grain <#> At this stage it 's important to check that the whole frame is sitting level <#> Using a straight edge you can check that both the long edges and the diagonals are sitting true <#> If it 's not level <,> pack in gravel to make any minor adjustments <#> In this case I 'm using quick-setting cement <,> but if you are using a regular mix <,> you should allow at least twenty-four hours before placing the house on the frame <#> To lift the house onto the frame you will need some friends <#> The heavier the shed <,> the bigger your next round is at the pub <,> <#> The only thing left to do now is to add some steps <#> Good bye Harry <#> Although this treehouse is only four feet off the ground <,> if you 're going to allow young children to use it <,> it would be essential to have a safety rail<&> later in programme </&><S2A-053$C> <#> John interior design by computer <#> I don't believe it <#> Is this possible<S2A-053$D> <#> Well <,> it 's not by computer but you can use a computer to help you do it <#> Previously it really was only architects and specialists who used this sort of thing but they 've become much more accessible and affordable<S2A-053$C> <#> What are we talking about <#> I mean a <.> p </.> a price to design your own front room for instance<S2A-053$D> <#> Well this little piece of software that I have on this machine is about a hundred pounds<S2A-053$C> <#> Not bad<S2A-053$D> <#> What we 've got is a floor plan equivalent to what you would get actually on a piece of paper <#> You can see dimensions there if I just zoom in a second <#> What it 's doing now is it 's actually building the room for us <,> it 's sorting out the polygons <#> People mightn't think they have many of those in their house <&> laughter </&> <#> Everybody has polygons<S2A-053$C> <#> Fantastic<S2A-053$D> <#> What 's nice about it now is that once we 're in there we can say as well <,> let 's have a little look around <{> <[> And we can go this way </[><S2A-053$C> <#> So you <[> can actually wander </[> </{> through the house<S2A-053$D> <#> We can wander through the house and just have a look as we go along<S2A-053$C> <#> Can you use the system on any computer<S2A-053$D> <#> Any personal computer of about the last year or so <#> So you what you will find is that some of the older systems don't have sufficient horsepower to handle the three-D graphics<S2A-053$C> <#> Now if I wanted to design myself my own room and put furniture in it <#> Can we do that<S2A-053$D> <#> Yes <#> We can do that<S2A-053$C> <#> Nice bright room to play with what I 'm going to have first of all <,> could I have please John a sofa<S2A-053$D> <#> Okay <,> no problem<S2A-053$C> <#> And I 'll have it <,> I think there <#> Just along there facing the fire<S2A-053$D> <#> Okay<S2A-053$C> <#> Mm <#> You know don't like it there <#> Could you move it <#> Can we move it to the back wall<S2A-053$D> <#> No problem<S2A-053$C> <#> That 'll do nicely <#> Ah no it 's too big <,> it 's too big <#> Can you can you do anything about that<S2A-053$D> <#> Yeah <#> Yeah what about a two-seater<S2A-053$C> <#> Two-seater would be perfect <,> yeah <#> That would do the trick <#> Two-seater on the back wall <,> sold <#> And let 's see <,> what else do I want <#> Uhm <,> I think something to keep the drink in and the glasses of course <#> Something there <,> something big <#> Could you give me a <,> a cabinet John <#> Cocktail cabinet<S2A-053$D> <#> Coming up<S2A-053$C> <#> Looks a bit bare <#> Can you uhm <,> can you fill it with bottles<S2A-053$D> <#> Unfortunately not Sean<S2A-053$C> <#> Oh well <#> Uh <,> what else <#> It 's a bit <,> it is still a bit bare isn't it <#> A plant <,> could you do me a plant or two <#> Oh very very clever <#> Not in the middle of the room <#> I didn't want a forest <#> Stick it in the <,> corner <#> Stick it in the corner<S2A-053$D> <#> Like that<S2A-053$C> <#> Yeah <#> Looks almost real doesn't it <#> What we need now is a television <#> Can you manage that<S2A-053$D> <#> No problem<S2A-053$C> <#> Okay <#> Television let 's see <#> Uhm over <,> there I think <#> No <#> No let 's give the burglars a really good view from the window <#> Let 's put it right bang in that corner<S2A-053$D> <#> Okay<S2A-053$C> <#> Do you think it 's too much to ask to have some legs on it <,> or a table<S2A-053$D> <#> Okay done<S2A-053$C> <#> And what about a little uhm elegance <,> something to impress people with books <#> A coffee table <#> Okay<S2A-053$D> <#> A coffee table <#> Here we go<S2A-053$C> <#> Mm <#> It 's not looking bad at all <#> Uhm actually the walls are bare <#> We 've got something very essential missing <#> Can you give me a picture John <#> Any chance of some art<S2A-053$D> <#> Alright<S2A-053$C> <#> Actually <,> I think it 's maybe just a tiny bit <,> bourgeois <#> Let 's do it again<S2A-053$D> <#> Absolutely not<&> later </&><S2A-053$A> <#> The first thing you should always think about when working with ladders must be safety <#> The angle that you set your ladder at is perhaps one of the most important safety points <#> If you have it at too steep an angle you risk falling backwards off the ladder <#> Too shallow an angle however <,> means you may overload the ladder <#> To find the correct angle to set your ladder at <,> for every four metres of height <,> have the base one metre from the wall <#> When faced with a situation like this where the roof overhangs <,> you can't lean the <.> g </.> ladder against the wall because you 'll have to reach out too far to catch the gutter <#> If you reach it against the gutter <,> you risk damaging the gutter or having the ladder slip <#> The solution is to use a ladder stand-on which spaces the ladder from the wall and also prevents it from slipping <#> If you 're working with your ladder on a steep gradient it won't be safe just packing up one leg of the ladder with bricks and blocks like these <#> What you really need to do is build a wooden platform <,> the base of which must be two foot by two <#> You then need to nail a batten onto your platform to prevent your ladder from slipping <,> <#> Another important part of ladder safety is that you must always have somebody hold the base of the ladder for you <#> And you should have at least a metre between the top of the ladder and the point at which you 're standing <#> And finally <,> to stop your ladder sinking into soft ground <,> what you need to do is to take your board with some large nails <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> through it to stop it slipping and then push this firmly into the ground<&> later </&><S2A-053$E> <#> The distressed look is achieved by using two colours <,> one base colour that 's going to <.> sh </.> show through sparingly <,> and a top colour which is applied once your base colour has been given a good generous rub down with a common household candle <#> It 's quite a popular look at the moment <,> it 's fairly informal and quite rustic <#> Once you have applied your top coat on top of the candle wax <,> give it a good hard rub back with medium grade wire wool <#> You could start off quite gently and build up the distressing <#> You don't want to have it looking too artificial <#> A good way to finish off the a distressed surface is actually good old uh shoe polish <#> A nice dark brown will actually intensify the colour as well as protecting the wood <#> Crackle glaze is a is a really good high impact finish that you can achieve with very very little effort indeed <#> Uhm it looks very impressive and the technique is extremely easy and extremely quick <#> It 's really best thought of as a as a paint sandwich <#> You 've got one layer of paint underneath your base coat <,> one layer of glaze in the middle <,> once that 's dry <,> another layer of paint on top <#> What happens is the glaze dries at a different time to the emulsion top coat and as the two start to dry <,> one will pull the other apart and give you these quite quite dramatic cracks <#> You can also achieve uh some quite impressive fantasy finishes with crackle glaze by applying it in circles and applying your top coat on straight <#> I 've discovered that you can also determine the size of the cracks by the thickness of your top coat <#> If you apply that fairly thickly you 'll end up with quite a large crack <#> If you do apply heat to it with a hair dryer on full blast you 'll be able to speed up the whole cracking process and enlarge those cracks into the bargain <#> I think that the floor is really an area of great untapped potential in everybody 's home <#> It 's the area in a room that I think can can unify the whole scheme <#> It can really bring a room to life <#> People are very very nervous about tackling a floor with paint and really <,> uh if the floor is appropriately primed <,> there 's absolutely no reason that it can't be completely transformed with paint <#> We have colour-washed the floorboards which have been sanded <,> just given a quick wipe down <#> Dilute down any water-based acrylic paint <,> probably three parts water to one part paint <#> You could experiment and maybe even try five parts to to one part paint <#> If you do it on a warm day you 'll have a floor completed <.> w </.> in a wood wash in no time at all <#> With this floor I thought I 'd go for something really dramatic indeed <#> I have used quite a quite a strong border <.> de </.> design in a mosaic <#> It 's <.> k </.> <,> and a nice contrast of uhm deep aquamarine blues with green <#> Uhm contrasting that with a little white mosaic with a hint of pink <#> And in the centre I 've used quite a big bold swirling shell-like design that reverses in on itself <#> It 's lots of movement and lots of interest there <,> and I think it really does set off the rest of the de/cor in the room <#> I think you 'll agree that there 's been really quite a memorable transformation in this room <#> We 've taken it from something that was blank <,> dull and really a bit depressing into the realms of fantasy almost <#> A bit of confidence <,> a spirit of adventure and between seventy-five and two hundred pounds should really put you well on the way to achieving this sort of a look</I>
