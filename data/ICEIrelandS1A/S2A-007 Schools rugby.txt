<S2A-007 Schools rugby><I><S2A-007$A> <#> The referee for this Final as he was two years ago when Methody beat Campbell College is the principal of Newtownbreda Primary School <,> Derek Henderson <,> <#> Derek Henderson blows his whistle and Richard McCloskey gets this <,> the one hundred and sixteenth Ulster Schools Cup final underway <#> Methodist College in traditional white facing a pretty stiffish breeze <,> an indication of just how stiff that breeze is shown by the kick from Alistair Redpath <,> one of the seven Coleraine players in action for the second year in a row <#> Gareth Bingham <,> the Methody full back appearing in his first final <#> This indeed the fifty-third Schools Cup final appearance for the side in white with the navy Maltese cross <,> Methodist College <#> Paul Curry the Ulster Schools hooker from Coleraine Inst for the first lineout of the afternoon <#> Bit loose <#> That 's Kettyle <,> to Callaghan <,> scrum half last year <,> a fine talented footballer <#> That 's to Bingham <,> little readjustment <#> Well there 's good stuff from Gareth Bingham now maybe that 's a little bit too much of <,> enterprise <#> McCloskey <,> he hasn't found touch <#> Roddy Wilson <,> breaks through one tackle <,> needs a bit of support from his pack <#> Methody have won that <#> Lively start <#> Derek Henderson waiting for advantage <,> and no advantage coming to Coleraine <,> and Methodist College over the top and with a stiffish breeze behind them <#> Chance of early points for Coleraine and for their skipper Darryl Callaghan <#> Darryl Callaghan <,> top points scorer this season <,> nine points in the Semi-Final <,> <#> And the first three of the nineteen ninety-two Ulster Bank Schools Cup Final with just three minutes gone <,> Darryl Callaghan the skipper puts his side into a three point lead but they 've got to build it up <#> He 'll need a few more kicks like this with that wind behind him just to press home the advantage by half-time <#> Good kick <,,> <#> It did look as if it went five metres <#> Well won by Methody <#> Good driving by Moore <#> Kirk <,> that 's good stuff Finlay <,> crunching tackle in the back <,> and the entire of Coleraine 's three quarter line off-side and that 's going to give Methody the chance after ten minutes to level this game <#> Ian Darby <,> the fifth former <,> the number eight holding the ball for Gareth Bingham <#> An important kick this <,> because it brings Methodist College the holders to level terms <,> <#> A great roar from the supporters in navy and white <,> and after ten minutes Gareth Bingham 's straightforward penalty conversion has brought it to Coleraine three and Methody three <,> <#> That 's a good comfortable scrum for Coleraine <,> good strike by Curry <#> Derek Henderson has a glance to see where the Methody backs are <#> That 's Kettyle <,> Callaghan <,> oh great burst by Bell he needs support he 's got it from Colin Forsythe and the headmaster 's son scores at the posts <#> Tremendous piece of control <,> the lovely little <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> pass and look how Alistair Redpath left it up for the full back Jonathan Bell <#> And coming in <.> s </.> in support was the headmaster 's son Colin Forsythe and what a great try <,> <#> Conversion by Callaghan and that 's just exactly what Coleraine needed <,> <#> That 's how close they are <,> a matter of a metre or two <#> Great Coleraine surge <,> that 's the way to repulse anything from the back row <#> There 's Darby on the pick-up <,> looking for Morrison in support <#> And the ball has come back on the Coleraine side albeit untidily <#> Callaghan has sliced that <#> Well taken by Bingham <#> Thundering tackle <#> Redpath picks it up <#> That 's great support from Johnson the number eight <,> he 's very strong <#> He needs a bit of help <#> He 's got it now <#> Great driving from Mark Waugh <#> Good stuff from Coleraine <#> Callaghan <#> Nicely moved <#> Bell waiting for the pass <,> well broken through by Barry Knox <#> Is Callaghan the skipper <,> is Callaghan the skipper going to make the line <#> The answer is yes <,> <#> Well out of nothing whatsoever and no wonder the Coleraine supporters are absolutely ecstatic <#> Thank-you very much <#> It came from a breakaway <#> Was a lovely piece of running now Barry Knox checked <,> stumbled <,> came inside and the Methody defence held off a little bit <,> Callaghan perfectly positioned and the man who played scrum half in last year 's final had the speed and the determination to get over at the post <#> Great try <,> <#> Callaghan himself <,> and Callaghan himself converts his own try and it 's now looking very good indeed for Coleraine Inst <,> fifteen points to three up <#> And just over twelve minutes remaining of the half <,> <#> Gareth Bingham restarts fairly quickly <#> Keith Johnson the solid Coleraine number eight <,> bit of pace and a lot of strength <#> Well Coleraine looking very confident <#> Kettyle <,> that 's Bell <,> oh lovely stuff from Bell <#> Tremendous support from the back row <,> and that 's great riding right through by the hooker <#> Well my goodness Paul Curry may go all the way <,> and a knock forward at the last minute and Paul Curry <,> the Ulster Schools hooker who 's so quick it 's just not true <,> <#> Well Paul Curry really picked that up and for all the world he looked like one of the centre three quarters <,> a lovely little show of the ball in the dummy <,> and he pinned his ears back and he went like the hammers <,> <#> Methody have done a bit of reshuffling <#> On this side with uh no number on his back is the replacement Martin McBryer who has come on for Gavin Morrison <#> Well done by Methody <#> That 's Darby <#> Oh nice piece of pace by the number eight <#> Little Peter Kirk <#> That 's the replacement <#> That 's McBryer <#> Kirk <,> McCloskey <#> Inside Callaghan <#> Again the Coleraine defence very solid and they 've won that <#> Callaghan <,> Redpath <#> That 's Knox <#> Oh he 's kept <,> he 's kept possession well now this could be a good chance here <,> and has he taken the wrong option <#> Support from Keith Johnson <,> if he gives it it must be a try <#> And that 's Gavin Wilmot who goes over and Coleraine starting to coast <,> <#> Well Gavin Wilmot will be absolutely delighted about that <#> Replacement in the final last year and he rounded off really a very straightforward three quarter movement <#> It was Barry Knox who perhaps just overdid it but uh his little body swerve took him right through <#> Jonathan Bell could have gone either way <#> He came inside <,> fine pass and there 's good support from the number eight <#> Well from this angle <,> slight hint of a forward pass but uh Gavin Wilmot waited until the whistle and the whistle indicated the try was good <#> Callaghan with the conversion <,> no mistake and as we come up to half-time <,> Coleraine looking very very comfortable at twenty-one points to three ahead <,> <#> Good strike by Martin the Methody skipper <,> a great surge by Coleraine <#> It 's a bit laboured <#> Finlay <#> Now Colin Forsythe the first Coleraine try scorer was there to win it <#> Callaghan <#> Now there 's a chance here <,> as Jonathan Bell <,> now he has got a lot of pace <,> he did it all on his own against Bangor in the Semi <#> There 's Keith Johnson <,> great support once again that 's Wilmot <,> out to Barry Knox <#> A wonderful tackle by Adam Robertson for Methody <#> Well my goodness <,> Coleraine exuding confidence that 's Callaghan <#> That 's Bell <#> That 's Redpath <#> Gives it to Roddy Wilson who <,> can he get round Hilditch <#> He can <#> And that 's the fourth try and Coleraine have waited for fifty-three years although there 's the whole of the second half to go <,> really they 've played some wonderful wonderful rugby and at this stage deserve to win the cup <#> And even look getting applause from some Methody supporters <#> The pack it was <,> set it up <#> It looked a little bit on the static side but it 's amazing how a wide pass can open things up <#> A little floater from Bell to Redpath and Redpath showed enough of the ball to give Roddy Wilson a chance and outside Andrew Hilditch he went <,> <#> Uh Daly Wells really just sits <,> has a wee look at the watch and thinks <,> well we 've got a <,> thirty-five minutes to come in the second half and who knows what might happen <#> Jeremy Davidson loves to take on opposing packs even though it 's all on his own <#> Arms flailing as hard as they can go <#> That 's Moore <#> Good stuff by Coleraine to repulse that drive <#> John Hutchinson the tight head prop trying to rip the ball away <,> and this time Methody 's turn to go offside <#> Knox <,> found a gap <,> that 's Bell who 's got a lot of pace <#> My goodness he can certainly inject something can't he <#> Lovely running by him <#> Now he 's running away from the support and back inside <,> that 's Redpath who scored last year <,> that 's Wilmot looking for a second <,> he 's that close <,> and he 's over <#> Oh the Methody defence really split wide open <#> No wonder Coleraine celebrate <#> Tremendous stuff <#> And what a grin on the face of Gavin Wilmot <#> A sub last year he 's come on and more than made up for it <#> But it all started by this splendid splendid full back Jonathan Bell <#> Now what a prospect he really is <#> He opened up the defence as he did the Bangor defence in the Semi-Final <,> side-footing men left right and centre <#> How 's that for a cheeky dummy <#> Once again the whole thing opened up <#> Alistair Redpath <,> a lovely transfer by him <,> and look at Wilmot <,> a little jink and over <,> and down for the try <#> And Callaghan <,> says thank-you very much indeed <,> and Methodist College are trailing now by thirty-one points to three in injury time in the first half <#> Five minutes of injury time played and Coleraine really making up for all those years in the rugby schools ' wilderness <#> Darryl Callaghan <,> Andrew Hilditch <,> that 's a pretty good kick <#> Well positioned by Callaghan <,> always stroked that absolutely wonderfully well <#> Derek Henderson looks at his watch and decides that it 's not over yet <#> Oh yes it is <#> So half-time at Ravenhill and without a doubt the best first half of any Schools Final I 've seen even though it has been more than somewhat one-sided <#> Coleraine Inst leading the holders Methodist College by thirty-one points to three <,,> <#> Gary McConnell <,> well taken by Methody <#> Coleraine men getting in the way and uh Peter Kirk dragging McConnell out of it unceremoniously <,> <#> Colin Martin nodding to his forwards and trying to keep them going <#> One of thirteen players who 'll be back at school again next year from this team so don't be surprised if we see Methody in a fifth Final <#> And what a good kick that was from Gareth Bingham <,> <#> Right into the corner and this the closest that Methodist College have been to the Coleraine line since early in the first half at the other end <,> <#> Back on the Methody side <,> Darby going for the line <#> He 's only a metre or two out <#> He scored in the Semi-Final Ian Darby <,> all in behind him <#> Tremendous Coleraine defence <,> determined not to let their line be crossed <,,> <#> Well it 's only three or four metres but they 've got to get past that Coleraine pack <#> Great surge by Methody <,> Darby holding and driving <#> He 's trying to pick up <,> but once again Coleraine have got underneath them <,> and Derek Henderson is awarded a penalty try against Coleraine <#> Well my goodness <#> The Coleraine pack have worked so hard this afternoon <,> under a little bit of pressure there and how interesting that Derek Henderson should go for the penalty try <#> It wasn't for collapsing <,> I think it was for coming in deliberately offside in order to prevent the score <,> so not collapsing but a deliberate offside and a penalty try awarded <#> Gareth Bingham to add two points to the four for the try <#> He does just that <#> And from thirty-one three down at half-time Methody have come right back with thirty-one nine <#> And would you ever bet against Methody at this stage <#> In by Kettlye <,> good strike by Curry <#> Well that 's untidy <#> Peter Kirk has done well for Methody <#> A bad clash of heads there <#> Methody shunting forward <#> That 's Jeremy Davidson <#> And once again he 's got that long body of his down towards the ground <#> Well won by Methody <#> McCloskey missed out <,> that 's Finlay <,> that 's Doyle <,> that 's Bingham with Robertson outside him if he gives this it could be a try <,> Robertson 's a fair bit to do <,> and across comes Alistair Redpath yet again <#> He has defended like a Trojan this afternoon <#> But the danger still not cleared for Coleraine and Methody get the scrummage <,,> <#> They 've held that scrum well <#> Darby <,> waiting for the pick-up <#> He 's having a glance just to see where the line is <#> Oh good control by Ian Darby <#> My goodness the youngster only in fifth form has done splendidly <#> Coleraine starting to detach <#> Now if Methody stay down which is the sensible thing to do they can well get over the Coleraine line again</I>
