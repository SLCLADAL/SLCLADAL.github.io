<#> And she was like <#> And she said that when she had answered it she recognised <,> the voice and she knew <,> that she had to ring them back <#> But otherwise she wouldn't have known <#> She said the person didn't even go up <,> to ring her bell to see was she there <#> And she was going to the landlord straight with it <#> And I said well it wasn't me <#> She said well it was either you or the girls next door because <,> the other girl wasn't there <#> And she said uhm and they say they didn't do it so it has to be one of you <#> And I said well look you know I 've been living here <,> it 's my second year here you know and <,> you know kind of <,> if there 's you know there haven't been complaints about it before like <#> I mean <,> one could <.> con </.> conclude that it wasn't me
