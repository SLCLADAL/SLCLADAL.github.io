<S2A-049 Fellowship group><I><S2A-049$A> <#> We 've had uh we 've had something humorous already <#> That was very humorous the way it turned out <,> so humorous it became <#> Uhm Jan came to me and asked would it be okay if she were to do a recording <#> And I <,> you know the way you get kind of dreams and hopes <,> <&> laughter </&> thinking I 'd be going live or maybe on a recorded disc to millions of homes and that it would sell big <,> but then she said it 's just for the grammar and intonation <#> So it 's like life itself really one minute you 're on cloud nine and the next <#> So that 's while I kind of pursue the notion in practice that so much of our culture if you call it that is is visual and image counts for a lot <#> I sometimes am afraid it might even count for more than words <,> not tonight of course but you know what I mean <,,> <&> takes out ornament </&> <#> Now <,> he 's uhm he 's an ecumenical <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> <#> He was gotten on the Shankill Road <#> When Clonard was being renovated <,> it 's finished now I suppose how many months <,> nearly a year <,> a <,> year <,> some of us were living in St Clements on the Antrim Road <,> and travelling back and forth <,> so I passed a shop called the Juke-In <,> there 's a name <,> just at the corner of Ainsworth Street <#> And they have various types of ornaments even out at the front of the shop <#> So I always wanted one of these <#> So I became the proud possessor <#> And having become the proud possessor he was sitting on my mantelpiece and I was looking at him and he was looking at me <#> Now the linkage of sorts came in the <,> in giving thanks to God <#> There are many things we could give thanks for <,> for his goodness <,> for the fact that he created us <,> all that <,> all of his creation <#> But for the ordinary things <,> I think there are things we actually don't name very much and don't think of very much <,> and should be and should be thanking God for <,> all the elements of creation like for instance sport <,> like humour <#> And uh humour <,> it 's been often said that around here humour has been a safety valve which has gotten people through many troubles and difficulties and I think there 's <,> I think there 's a great truth in it <#> So I used him when preaching in the church<&> brief conversation with audience </&><#> Thank God someone remembers <&> laughter </&> <#> Yeah <#> People still inquire as to how he 's getting on <#> I bring him out now and then <,> give him a trial <#> But there 's <,> we say our thanksgiving prayer with Mary our Mother <,> at the end of the Novena <,> we thank God with Mary for all the graces <,> the blessings and so on that God has given us <#> And one grace and blessing he has given us I think <,> is humour <#> So thank God for that <#> There 's a great psalm too and uhm <,> a great psalm of thanksgiving which I 'd say we know pretty <,> pretty well <#> <quote> My soul give thanks to the Lord <,> all my being bless his holy name <,> my soul give thanks to the Lord <,> and never forget all his blessings <,> the heavens are high above the earth <,> so strong is his love for those who fear him <,> as far as the east is from the west <,> so far does he remove our sins <,> the love of the Lord is everlasting on those who hold him in awe <,> he has set his sway in the heavens <,> and his kingdom rules over all <,> my soul give thanks to the Lord </quote> <#> So it 's in that kind of <,> I suppose context really <,> thanking God for His gifts <,> that I would say these few words about humour <#> I 'd be fiercely interested if <,> you know if there were <,> and there possibly is <,> I haven't gotten around to studying books but some <,> some analysis then of how humour actually gives us a view and puts us in touch with reality <#> Part of our day-to-day reality is I think is we 've become serious and sometimes too serious about many many things <#> We feel for instance very often that we 're controllers of our own destiny <#> We 're in charge <#> Foolish notion that is <#> And there 's a sense in which humour I think teaches us <unclear> several sylls </unclear> to dissect them or to say what 's what <#> Or humour <,> we can all say we 're talking about good humour <,> I suppose <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> It it it separates us I think <,> from viewing reality as in our particular kind of domain or control <#> It separates us from taking things too seriously in that sense <,> that we 're actually in God 's hands <#> We are His creation <,> His beloved <#> And humour 's you know <,> in that <,> from that point of view <,> giving us that kind of separation <,> giving us <,> humour gives us a better view of reality I think <,> which is more in touch with reality <#> Talking about humour and putting us in touch with reality <,> one of the incidents in <,> when the Troubles were at their height <,> I remember walking from the monastery here <,> I was going over Dunmore Street <,> which was there then <,> won't be there too longer <,> it would certainly be a different shape <,> anyway <,> they 're building there at the moment <#> And there was this man <,> a bomb had gone off <,> and he was nailing his front window <#> He was putting up boards or something <#> And as I passed I stopped a moment and I looked up and and he says to me as he looked down <,> he says <,> do you want a hammer <,> for him to to you know jump in and help him <#> And I thought that <,> you know <,> a very <,> a very humorous thing for him to say <#> In the midst of uh what was a tragedy really <,> I mean well <,> I mean how many people if they 've got their front window blown in would think it was the worst calamity since the Titanic <#> But here was he <,> hammering away <,> serious matter for him <,> but yet he was able to notice me looking up and thought of course wrongly that I had time on my hands <,> and inviting me to join him in in this <,> repairing his house <#> The uh separation <,> humour can come to us too in the separation of uh that we mightn't take ourselves too seriously <#> There was a an incident here in the <,> in the monastery not so very long ago <,> where it didn't kind of I suppose redound to my glory but then as I often say as long as the glory goes to God in the long run <#> Martin Cassidy <,> one of our communion was celebrating his Jubilee <,> as were <,> were a few people <,> a few <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <#> Martin wasn't one <,> a few <,> four <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> celebrating jubilees of various sorts <#> So there were individual sort of <,> Ronan O'Dowd asked some of us to give a <.> litt </.> few words <#> There were about four celebrating jubilees <,> there were four of us chosen <#> Martin Cassidy who 's what seventy <,> eighty and uh hard of hearing and his health isn't good <#> He was sitting <,> and it was my turn <,> I was talking about Tim O'Driscoll who was celebrating the Jubilee <,> and Martin was kind of sitting there listening <,> half listening I suppose <,> you know he really is fairly deaf <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> So I thought <,> I was giving what I thought was a very fine speech <#> I was second on the list <,> there were at least two more to come <#> So I was second on the list <#> So there was I speaking away <,> and reaching a very climactic point in the address <,> and I allowed a pregnant pause <,> and Martin Cassidy from the side <,> everyone <,> I included <,> could hear <,> loudly and clearly saying <,> who 's next <&> laughter </&> <#> I thought it a terrible interruption <#> I was just getting into the last that important part of the little speech but I never <,> never quite got there <#> I was stopped in my tracks <,> <#> Uhm <,> last <,> last week <,> two of us were in Portglenone <#> We met Andrew Maxwell <,> a minister in the First Presbyterian communion for a bit of a get-together <#> And I was telling a story from the pulpit <,> well story <unclear> several sylls </unclear> about these group of people down by a riverside and they were being baptised by being immersed in the water <#> And this character who 's drunk happens to wander in to the company and the preacher says to him <,> have you found Jesus <#> And the man says <,> no <,> I haven't <#> So the preacher gets him they 're all looking on and praying on his behalf and the preacher dumped him into the water <#> Have you found Jesus <#> And they pulled him <,> no <,> he says <#> So down he goes again this time for a longer time <#> They haul him up <#> Have you found Jesus now <#> Your man says <,> no I haven't he says <,> are you sure this is where he fell in <&> laughter </&> <,,> <#> There are one or two accusations that would hurt me deeply <,> one I suppose would be to say if people said I was pious and the other would be if people were to say I was just an entertainer <#> So the point of telling that story actually was to say <,> as I did after telling the story <,> that those of the Reform churches are right <,> and they would say that Jesus saves us <#> We can even maybe joke about you know sometimes about the kind of extreme preachers that go around and are talking about Jesus saving us and all the rest of it <#> But <,> the truth is there <#> It is part of our faith <,> our Christian faith we 've been saved by Jesus Christ <#> So I went on you know not very beautifully on that point <&> laughter </&> <unclear> several syllables </unclear> <#> Cos really <.> th </.> <,> I 'd say that 's about all I have to say <.> th </.> <#> I 'd be fiercely interested too again in a kind of <.> so </.> <,> what do you call it psychological analysis of the value of humour in <,> say preaching <#> I think there 's a powerful unanalysed value in the kind of telling of a joke for instance even before <,> you know in a sermon <#> The the effect it has in relaxing people <,> again maybe the effect of <,> of the reality of the scene <,> of not <,> taking our own selves too seriously <,> whatever value I think is amazing an amazing thing <#> I often kind of marvel at the effect that humour has on a group of people <#> But those are few <,> my few rambling words</I>
