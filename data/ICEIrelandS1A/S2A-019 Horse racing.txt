<S2A-019 Horse racing><I><S2A-019$A> <#> I think Sweet Robin is the one for me <#> I thought uh it was a good race at Ascot uh behind Blue Gusto <#> He beat six or seven lengths <#> Uhm <,> I know Panga has has done nothing wrong but I think that Sweet Robin 's going to <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> it up <,><S2A-019$B> <X> <#> I 'm going for Panga here and uh <,> <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> Michael Kinane to ride a double <,> </X><S2A-019$C> <X> <#> And here 's Tony O'Hehir to call them home <,> </X><S2A-019$D> <#> Ribot 's Secret uh <,> my fancy Christy Roche 's mount <#> They 're locked away for the Railway Stakes <#> And they 're away <#> The Toddy Tapper uh is a little uh slower than the others <#> And in the early stages it 's Sweet Robin <,> who leads with uh Long Beach nearest to us and second Amaretto Bay at the far side the yellow cap in third <#> Then comes uh Ribot 's Secret <#> They 're followed by Flame of Athens <#> Panga the favourite is next <#> The Toddy Tapper <,> uh brings up the rear <#> They 've gone about a furlong and a half now and it 's uh <,> Long Beach <,> who 's uh <,> who 's veering the lead on the stand side <#> Amaretto Bay is uh gone up uh alongside <#> They run down past the four now <#> And it 's Long Beach <,> on the inside <,> who 's uh disputing the lead <#> Amaretto Bay on the right of the picture <#> Ribot 's uh Secret between horses <#> They 're followed by Sweet Robin being pushed along by Frankie Dettori <#> They 're coming down now with uh over two furlongs to go <#> And it 's uh Long Beach the far rail from Sweet Robin Ribot 's Secret is uh one from the right <#> Extreme right Amaretto Bay <#> Flame of Athens coming there on the centre <#> Inside the two Long Beach <#> Ribot 's Secret on the near side <#> Flame of Athens and John Reid between them <#> Then comes Sweet Robin <#> Panga 's making uh <,> heavy weather of it in behind them <#> They 're running on a bit <#> But it 's Ribot 's Secret and Flame of Athens inside the <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> furlong <#> Ribot 's Secret on the near side of Flame of Athens <#> Then comes Long Beach Ribot <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> on the inside <#> Flame of Athens comes through in the centre <#> On the far side <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> Athens uh Sweet Robin Ribot 's Secret and they 're followed in <,> by uh Long Beach Amaretto Bay Panga and the Toddy Tapper is last <#> So <,> it 's a tight uh photograph to the P V Doyle Memorial <,> Railway Stakes with uh John Reid and Flame of Athens uh coming there to uh hit the front and uh Sweet Robin <,> really motoring in the closing stages <,> uh running on really well on the far side <#> It 's a tight photo between number two Flame of Athens who was in front just before the post <#> We just uh see now in the replay whether uh Sweet Robin grabbed her <,> on the line<S2A-019$A> <#> Well Sweet Robin looked well and truly stuffed at this stage as she loses her place and uh hangs in behind uh Long Beach at this stage <#> I thought she was <.> w </.> well and truly scuttled there <#> But in the centre coming now with what I thought looked like a winning run for a few strides there was Ribot 's Secret <,> uh the blue with the yellow <#> And in between the two of those is uhm <,> John Reid on Flame of Athens uh this well-bred uh <,> son of uh Flame of Tara and Royal Academy <#> And he gets his head in front here <#> Now shakes off Ribot 's Secret on his right <#> And but on the extreme inside in the Sheikh Mohammed colours Frankie Dettori 's getting another run out of uh Sweet Robin and uh closes that <,> in the last fifty yards <#> But at this stage I still thought that Flame of Athens had the upper hand <#> And I think he just <,> Flame of Athens may have held on <#> On the inside Sweet Robin is closing with every stride but Flame of Athens has the best part of a <,> head to spare at this stage <#> They 're not at the line yet <#> Flame of Athens on the John Reid <,> keeping his head out stretching well <#> Now Sweet Robin on the far side is getting closer <#> It 's on the nod but <,> we haven't got to it yet I think <#> Uh Flame of Athens has just held on <,,> <#> Flame of Athens from Sweet Robin <,> and at Long Beach in third <#> That 's the way <,> we see it <#> We could be wrong <#> Ribot 's Secret third I should 've said <,><S2A-019$C> <X> <#> What an exciting finish that one was <#> And if Flame of Athens has got there he 's uh <,> it 's a case of history repeating itself because it wasn't all that long ago that Salsaville his half-brother <,> was here on <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> <,> on Derby Day <#> Having won the big one Salsaville <,> this is <{> <[> <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> Royal Academy <#> Here 's the result </[> </X><S2A-019$D> <#> <[> The result of the P V Doyle Memorial </[> </{> Railway Stakes two <,> seven <,> six <#> <{> <[> Number two was fourth <,> number one fifth </[> <#> Number five was sixth <#> Number four was seventh<S2A-019$C> <X> <#> <[> He 's just got there <,,> <#> He 's got there </[> </{> </X><S2A-019$A> <#> Nice one for uh Pat O'Kelly and <,> a brilliant one for Michael Grassick <,> <#> Uh Michael O'Shane just around the back of the stands here has thought a lot of this two year old all the way through <#> And uh he 's been <,> uh supported by Pat O'Kelly with some well-bred horses <#> Uh there he is in the centre Michael with the light beige suit on him <,> uh blonde hair <#> On the extreme right of him is his brother uh Brian <#> And uh Pat O'Kelly is in the blue on the left of the picture uh with the navy blue hat and the light blue uhm <,> dress <#> And Michael 's daughter 's to the back there <,> and uh John Reid successful winning jockey <,> and Miriam Michael 's uh wife with the giving a a well-done kiss there to him uh with the pink hat <,> and blue dress <#> Well-done to Michael <#> And a great success here to win the <,> uh P V Doyle Memorial Railway Stakes here <#> The Railway 's a group three hard race to win always been won by some great horses over the years <#> And lovely to see Michael <,> uh win this group three here on Derby Day at the Curragh <#> It 'll make all those early mornings and hard work worthwhile because it does get a bit frustrating when things just don't go right and it 's nice to win a race like that with a well-bred horse <,> with any horse <#> The SP on uh the P V Doyle Memorial Railway Stakes is as follows<S2A-019$D> <#> First number two Flame of Athens at eight to one <#> Second place was number seven Sweet Robin at nine to two <,> and third number six Ribot 's Secret at five to two <#> The unplaced favourite number five Panga <,> at two to one <,> and all seven ran<S2A-019$C> <X> <#> Yes that 's the way they came home there in the Railway Stakes <#> A good winner there and an exciting race <#> Little bit disappointing for the supporters of Panga <#> But those who supported Michael Kinane and Dermot Weld in the first race <,> the uh Waterford Crystal World Sports Maiden over seven furlongs for two year olds they had no such disappointment <#> We can recount the closing stages now with Tony O'Hehir<S2A-019$D> <#> Coming to the fourth furlong marker now and uh Peace Prize on the inside is the leader from Roi Estate in second and there followed by Red Rose Walk <#> Then on the inside <,> is His Excellence being pushed along <#> They 're just <,> followed by Pink Perignon towards the outside Azura with uh Vivo putting in a bid <#> Racing down now towards the uh last two furlongs and Peace Prize <,> is disputing the lead with His Excellence gone through on the inside <#> Roi Estate just behind them in third <#> They 're followed by Pink Perignon <#> Vivo out in the centre of the track <#> But it 's His Excellence on the far rail who 's just a leader from Peace Prize Roi Estate Ashbal <#> Making ground just in behind them is Suposenitdid <#> And then racing towards the finish Peace Prize <#> And His Excellence Vivo down the centre of the track <#> Peace Prize His Excellence on the far side <#> Peace Prize is going to get there <#> Peace Prize does <,> from His Excellence Vivo third Ashbal fourth and close for the fifth <,> between Roi Estate and Suposenitdid <,><S2A-019$C> <X> <#> A cheeky head there by Mick Kinane <#> Peace Prize the winner at five to one <#> Second was His Excellence at three to one <,> and third was number seven Vivo the six to four favourite <#> Peace Prize a colt by Polish Precedent out of a half sister to Riverman <#> No doubt we 'll be hearing more from him in due course </X></I><I><S2A-019$D> <#> Dancing Sunset towards the outer with Double On making a bit of ground <#> And then comes Russian Snows with Khaytada <#> They 're in the straight <#> They 've less than three to race and it 's Tea Service from Royal Ballerina <#> They 're followed by Flagbird <#> Russian Snows is putting in a run on the outside <#> Alisidora behind the leaders on the inner <#> They 're followed by uh Double On and Dancing Sunset and then Khaytada <#> But it 's Flagbird who edges ahead now from Russian Snows on the outside <#> Then comes Tea Service and Royal Ballerina <#> Ballykett Nancy is in behind them <#> They 're racing down inside the last two furlongs <#> Flagbird and Russian Snow is locked together <#> Ballykett Nancy coming with a run on the outside <#> Russian Snows is in Flagbird as they race towards the line <#> They fight it out together <#> Flagbird on the inside of Russian Snows <unclear> 8 sylls </unclear> on the far side <#> Flagbird 's given the win away <#> Wins it by about a head <#> Russian Snows second <,> then Ballykett Nancy <,> and uh Royal Ballerina Alisidora Double On <,> then Subya Khaytada Tea Service <#> Dancing Sunset is last of the ten <#> So <,> a photo finish to the group two Independent Pretty Polly Stakes <,> with uh victory going to a number one Flagbird for Godolphin</I><I><S2A-019$D> <#> Ivory Frontier has gone in <#> Here comes uh Ridgewood Ben <,> <#> Comes in nice and quietly for Christie Roche <#> Here comes the Belmont Stakes sixth Off and Away <,> and Kinane and the opener in the same colours <,> on Peace Prize who 'll wear the same silks later on in the Derby on The Definite Article <#> And they 're off and running in the Sea World International Stakes <#> And uh in the early stages uh up there on the outside is uh Dance Turn and uh also Shemaran and towards the inside Ivory Frontier and Darnay <#> They 're followed by uh Ridgewood Ben and then comes Off and Away <#> With Fraam towards the back marker as they head up towards the sixth <#> And it 's uh <,> Dance Turn on the outside of uh <,> Dance Turn and we change angles Dance Turn noseband near side of uh <,> Ivory Frontier <#> They 're followed by Darnay <#> Shemaran is next <#> Then comes Fraam <#> Behind Fraam is Ridgewood Ben with uh Off and Away <#> As they race down from the top of the hill they 've uh less than five furlongs to race <#> And it 's Ivory Frontier who shows just ahead of Dance Turn in second <#> Darnay in the blue colours third <#> Then Shemaran in the green four there followed by uh <,> Off and Away on the inside of uh Ridgewood Ben <#> And alongside of Ridgewood Ben <,> is the uh make me swing <#> Into the turn <,> and uh straighted up for home is Fraam as they come towards the two and a half furlong point now <#> And it 's uh <,> Ivory Frontier the leader from Dance Turn <#> John Reid has been hard at work all the way <#> Darnay <,> and Frankie Dettori in the blue making a bid <#> Off and Away is in behind them there followed by Fraam <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> And Darnay comes to take it up from Dance Turn <#> Off and Away <unclear> 5 sylls
