<S1A-100 College plans><I><S1A-100$A> <#> My plan is to become popular by uhm being really good at cooking and making them all dependent on me <,> kind of like a drug dealer <,> and then they 'll need me so I 'll be friends with them <&> laughter </&><S1A-100$B> <#> Like a drug dealer<S1A-100$A> <#> Only with food <,><S1A-100$B> <#> Judith is there something you want to tell us<S1A-100$A> <#> Yeah I I I 'm a food dealer <&> laughter </&><S1A-100$B> <#> Yeah you look like the type alright <#> Those eyes are always quite shifty<S1A-100$A> <#> Yeah <,> with a hungry look<S1A-100$B> <#> <&> laughter </&> Oh God <,> I mean I know I 'm sure you <,> you can't wait <#> Like what <,> what 's the accommodation there like <#> Is it nice or is it<S1A-100$A> <#> Uh it 's fairly good <,> it 's better than a lot of places <#> Uhm you 'd share <,> everybody has their own room and you have the room for three years which most places only give it to you for one or two years<S1A-100$B> <#> You pay every year then<S1A-100$A> <#> Yeah <#> And you only have to pay rent for the weeks of term which is loads better than getting a flat <,> because for that you 'd have to pay for the whole <{> <[> year <,> </[> <#> And I think you share a kitchen with three other people <,> which is the least anywhere else would have you <#> Like in Reading you 'd share with between three and eleven people<S1A-100$B> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><S1A-100$B> <#> Okay well most places <,> I remember places where I went to over in Liverpool I remember it was <,> you shared as well but there was maximum of six I think<S1A-100$A> <#> Right <#> It 's not bad but uhm anyway like three is pretty good so<S1A-100$B> <#> Yeah no three is actually brilliant<S1A-100$A> <#> Yeah <,> <#> Uh so it 's <,> like they <,> you sort of have like a bedroom and it 's okay and there 's a room <,> like a sort of a bigger dining room where you can have people over and stuff so<S1A-100$B> <#> Oh cool<S1A-100$A> <#> It looks pretty good and you can kind of <,> it 's handy like you can choose between cooking for yourself and going down to the canteen and in a lot of other places you have to decide at the start of term which you want to do and you 're stuck with that for the rest of the term<S1A-100$B> <#> Oh right<S1A-100$A> <#> But like you can <,> you have both options there anyway so <,> I just have to keep reminding myself of that <&> laughter </&> <#> One of my study incentives<S1A-100$B> <#> And then is it like <,> are all the rooms ensuite or do youse all share a bathroom as well<S1A-100$A> <#> Uhm <,> some of them are ensuite <#> You kind of apply for it and it 's kind of first come first served so <,> <{> <[> fingers crossed </[> for me<S1A-100$B> <#> <[> Fingers crossed </[> </{><S1A-100$B> <#> Yeah so <,> so hopefully just the three people are alright and they 're not <,><S1A-100$A> <#> Exactly<S1A-100$B> <#> Cos then like with eleven people you 'd be assured to have a few good people there but three people you 're just<S1A-100$A> <#> Yeah<S1A-100$B> <#> Fingers crossed <&> laughter </&> <#> Nice people<S1A-100$A> <#> Hopefully <#> Hopefully <#> Oh well that 's if I get in at all I mean <,><S1A-100$B> <#> Ah you did I 'm sure<S1A-100$A> <#> You didn't sit my exams<S1A-100$B> <#> But you 're Judith <#> You 're smart<S1A-100$A> <#> Yeah but it was hard<S1A-100$B> <#> I 'm sure it was but <,> it 's always you come out thinking I did crap but <,> you actually did okay<S1A-100$A> <#> Mm<S1A-100$B> <#> And you need what <,> you need one A and four Bs<S1A-100$A> <#> Two As<S1A-100$B> <#> Two As and four Bs<S1A-100$A> <#> Yeah<S1A-100$B> <#> Let 's see and do they <,> do the As have to be in like honours subjects<S1A-100$A> <#> Yes <#> They have to be in history and geography<S1A-100$B> <#> History and geography <#> Right <#> They have to have to be in <,> right <#> That 's a bit pissy that it has to be history and geography<S1A-100$A> <#> It is a bit pissy really<S1A-100$B> <#> Can it not just be any subject or<S1A-100$A> <#> Nope <#> I mean occasionally they 'll kind of make allowances for you <#> You 're not meant to know it but <,> they do sometimes like if you got <,> like I was talking to some girl at an open day there who <,> like she was a student there and she was over from Ireland <#> And like they wanted As in like <,> biology and chemistry and maths or something <,> and she got like the As in biology and chemistry and a B in maths and an A in something else so she <,> they let her in anyway<S1A-100$B> <#> Yeah <#> Sure you never know <#> Maybe they might<S1A-100$A> <#> Yeah <#> Hopefully <#> Oh well I 'll just appeal everything I don't like<S1A-100$B> <#> But sure for all you know you could could have got A in both of them <#> But the worst thing is <,> imagine if you appealed and then the result came back worse<S1A-100$A> <#> That 's horrible but they only did did that to like eight people and they upgraded a few thousand I think so<S1A-100$B> <#> Ah right yeah<S1A-100$A> <#> I think it 's pretty unlikely to happen<S1A-100$B> <#> No <,> cos that 's the one thing I 'd fear about contesting a result <#> I 'd just be like <,> and they 'd go back over it with a <,> even more so <,> cos <{> <[> like </[> realistically they correct the stuff in the space of like <,> what <,> five minutes or something like that<S1A-100$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-100$A> <#> Yeah <#> But I mean I think they say they go back over it when you appeal it looking for <.> mar </.> extra marks they can give you <,> not looking for<&> interruption in tape </&><S1A-100$A> <#> Okay <#> That was easy to fix<S1A-100$B> <#> What was it<S1A-100$A> <#> He just moved it<S1A-100$B> <#> Oh right <&> laughter </&> <,> <#> So do I not <,> did I not get any hold music no<S1A-100$A> <#> Uhm no you 're not on hold<S1A-100$B> <#> You could put me on hold<S1A-100$A> <#> No <,> I just yelled over my shoulder at my dad <#> That doesn't count as putting you on hold<S1A-100$B> <#> Fine<S1A-100$A> <#> Oh <#> Have you ever heard the Specsavers ' hold music<S1A-100$B> <#> No<S1A-100$A> <#> It 's like clown music <#> It 's awful <#> And then if you ask to be put up to the contact lens department they put you on hold again <#> And it 's the same clown music only faster and more high-pitched <&> laughter </&> <#> And every few seconds it 's interrupted by <,> <quote> welcome to Specsavers <#> Your call is important to us </quote><S1A-100$B> <#> That 's just scary<S1A-100$A> <#> It 's really horrible<S1A-100$B> <#> I 'm so glad I use Vision Express<S1A-100$A> <#> Yeah I know <#> It seems to have paid off as well considering how well you can see a pool table<S1A-100$B> <#> Yeah <#> It 's great <&> laughter </&><S1A-100$A> <#> Pool hustler<S1A-100$B> <#> No but <#> No but although I 've never had to ring them <,> so for all I know they could have weird hold music as well<S1A-100$A> <#> Yeah they might <#> And in my mam 's old work it was really bad <#> It was like a computer-generated version of Greensleeves and it was really slow and depressing and horrible<S1A-100$B> <#> Oh God<S1A-100$A> <#> It was really bad<S1A-100$B> <#> Yeah <,> no that would be alright<S1A-100$A> <#> Basically there is no good hold music<S1A-100$B> <#> No <#> Except for the lift music <#> That 's pretty near<S1A-100$A> <#> The what music<S1A-100$B> <#> Lift music<S1A-100$A> <#> Where<S1A-100$B> <#> In lifts<S1A-100$A> <#> Not all lifts <#> Actually I don't think I 've ever been in a lift that had lift music<S1A-100$B> <#> One thing I hate though <,> talking lifts <#> I hate them<S1A-100$A> <#> Rory <,> where do you get in lifts <#> I 've never come across any of these things<S1A-100$B> <#> Have you never heard <,> seen those talking lifts where it 's <,> ground floor <,> first floor<S1A-100$A> <#> No <#> Oh well in airports<S1A-100$B> <#> Yeah <#> Between the <,> those kind of yokes<S1A-100$A> <#> Welcome to departures<S1A-100$B> <#> Uhm <,> what do you call <,> and where else did <,> was I in one <#> I think Arnott 's might have them<S1A-100$A> <#> Really<S1A-100$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-100$A> <#> Why don't you go up the stairs <,> you lazy git<S1A-100$B> <#> Ah no like we were <,> I can't remember why we were going up the lift but we went up the lift <#> I was <,> I think it 's cos we were going up to the second floor and we were down in the basement and we were just walking by the lifts anyway so it was just like <,><S1A-100$A> <#> Isn't that for people in wheelchairs<S1A-100$B> <#> Well uh <,> them and the lazy<S1A-100$A> <#> <&> laughter </&> Them and the lazy<S1A-100$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-100$A> <#> Fair enough<S1A-100$B> <#> No so <,> but what were we talking about there<S1A-100$A> <#> I 've no idea <#> We were gibbering<S1A-100$B> <#> Yeah no we kind of got sidetracked there and there 's <,> there 's something I was going to say <#> I can't remember now <,> <#> Uhm <,> no it 's gone<S1A-100$A> <#> Aw<S1A-100$B> <#> I know <#> It probably wasn't that interesting anyway<S1A-100$A> <#> That 's possible<S1A-100$B> <#> Yeah <,> well you never know <.> may </.> <,> if I remember it<S1A-100$A> <#> We were talking about the exams<S1A-100$B> <#> Yeah no <,> it wasn't something about <,> I think it was something about lifts but I can't think of it <,> what it was now<S1A-100$A> <#> Oh well<S1A-100$B> <#> Oh yeah <,> now I remember <#> No see once when I was in a lift with my brother <,> we were in James 's hospital right<S1A-100$A> <#> Mhm<S1A-100$B> <#> And while the lift was going down he opened the doors<S1A-100$A> <#> What a bastard <#> What the hell did he do that for<S1A-100$B> <#> He was just like <,> ah <,> Rory <,> I was in here like cos he was in the lift by himself earlier and he did that like <,> and he was just like <,> oh look at this <,> this is so cool<S1A-100$A> <#> Ah <#> That 's like something my brother would do<S1A-100$B> <#> <&> laughter </&> And it was just like <,> then the thing <,> the lift stopped and it was just like <,> oh no we 're stuck <,> we 're stuck <#> Oh my God <#> And it was just like <&> laughter </&> and he was just there oh Jesus I can't even close them <,> I was just like <,> Michael<S1A-100$A> <#> What an idiot<S1A-100$B> <#> But he was only pretending he closed the doors <,> so <#> Then the thing started going again and it was just like <,> you fucking bastard<S1A-100$A> <#> <&> laughter </&> Ugh <#> That 's horrible<S1A-100$B> <#> I know cos <,> like I usually I don't mind small confined spaces but if I was going to be stuck there it would be pretty crazy<S1A-100$A> <#> Yeah <#> That would really be horrible <#> Have you seen that ad you know where they get stuck in the lift and they start drinking coffee <#> I mean wouldn't that be the worst thing you could do when you were stuck in a lift <,> like drinking something that was going to make you need to pee really soon<S1A-100$B> <#> Yeah I know <&> laughter </&> <#> Yeah I know that would be quite a stupid idea really <,> <#> Oh <,> so <,> I 'll never forget that day <#> It was just like <&> gasp </&> <,> but<S1A-100$A> <#> It 's really horrible<S1A-100$B> <#> It really is <#> And you wonder why I 'm the bitter middle child<S1A-100$A> <#> Yeah I 've suddenly realised why you 're so bitter <#> I mean it couldn't have been because of his laziness because you 're just as lazy <#> So I didn't know what it was <#> Or just the fact that everyone calls you Little Rasho<S1A-100$B> <#> That that that also annoys me actually yeah<S1A-100$A> <#> So when your sister gets there they 're just going to call her Female Rasho <&> laughter </&><S1A-100$B> <#> Female Rasho<S1A-100$A> <#> Just like you only wearing Escape for women instead<S1A-100$B> <#> Yeah <,> <#> Is that <,> is that nice is that nice all that stuff or would you know<S1A-100$A> <#> What <#> Escape for women<S1A-100$B> <#> Mm<S1A-100$A> <#> It 's kind of old-womany <#> It 's not that nice<S1A-100$B> <#> Yeah <#> That wouldn't be nice at all really <#> Or how about Emporio for women <#> Is that nice<S1A-100$A> <#> Hang on no <,> yeah <#> I haven't smelled Escape for women <,> I 've smelled Emporio for women and it 's not very nice<S1A-100$B> <#> God you women really don't <,> maybe the <,> maybe it 's the ones where they like do a man and women version<S1A-100$A> <#> Yeah<S1A-100$B> <#> The men 's version 's always nicer<S1A-100$A> <#> I don't know <#> Ah well <,> we have nice smells in Boots<S1A-100$B> <#> Exactly<S1A-100$A> <#> Ginger and lime <,> nothing can beat it<S1A-100$B> <#> Uh no so <,> what was it but <,> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> I can't remember what it was now <#> I really have the memory of<S1A-100$A> <#> You keep doing that<S1A-100$B> <#> I really have the memory of a goldfish you know I<S1A-100$A> <#> I think the exams have done something to you<S1A-100$B> <#> Yeah they 've just <&> laughter </&> ruined my mind forever <#> School 's over <#> Don't need that any more<S1A-100$A> <#> School 's over and it 's destroyed you <#> Ah so much fun throwing out notes <#> I just went into a note-cleaning frenzy the other day <,> threw out everything in about half an hour<S1A-100$B> <#> Oh I know it 's great</I>
