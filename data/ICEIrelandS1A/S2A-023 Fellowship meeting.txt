<S2A-023 Fellowship meeting><I><S2A-023$A> <#> I actually feel terribly rebuked in in a way really <,> I walk in here tonight <,> Willie walks in with a bag and a Bible and I walk in with a book entitled The Day I Fell down the Toilet <&> laughter </&> <#> But my daughters gave me this <&> laughter </&> my daughters gave me this because there 's a little poem in it they knew would really appeal to my humour <#> Let me share it with you <#> It 's called The Wee Poem <#> It 's by a man called Steve Turner <#> He 's a relatively new modern uhm English poet <#> <quote> Please <,> don't be slow in taking me home <,> I need to go for a wee <,> I try to think of something else <,> but a wee uh just wants to wee <,> oh no it 's Mr Barnstaple taking his dog for a walk <,> please <,> pretend he 's invisible even if he stops for a talk <,> now Barnstaple has spotted you <,> he was just about to call <,> he 's got all the time in the world <,> and I 've got no time at all <,> I mustn't think of waterfalls or taps or bubbling streams <,> I have to cross my legs and think of mashed potatoes and greens <,> at last the man he walks away and I think I 'm home and dry <,> I want to bounce from here to there with one big leap through the sky <,> but suddenly my worries go <,> and there 's nothing more I can do <,> my heart is warm and so 's my leg <,> and there 's a squelching in my shoe </quote> <&> laughter </&> <#> You know laughter 's great medicine <#> Any of you have ever been to see Patch Adams <#> It 's a film based actually on the true story of a doctor who believed laughter was a great prescription for life and for joy <,> and just <,> good medicine <#> And yet it 's incredible the number of God 's people who haven't got that prescription <#> Because for somehow or another and there 's a long history to it <,> Christians can't handle laughter <#> Have you any of you read The Name of the Rose or seen the film by Umberto Eco <#> And you know <.> i </.> it 's a fascinating <,> I have been fascinated by monasteries from oh for years and years and years <#> Absolutely fascinated and of course The Name of the Rose is set in a medieval monastery <,> and what 's at the very heart of this monastery <#> There 's a secret <,> and that secret revolves around a book that 's hidden in the very very depths of the sort of the inner sanctuary of this library and nobody is allowed to see this book <#> And the book is all about laughter <#> Because well you see they were afraid to laugh <#> Now Wallace or <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> who 's a a modern writer on spirituality <,> he says <,> I just can't imagine heaven is a place where there will be no laughter <#> But when you look at Northern Ireland you almost get to the stage you know you see people coming down the street and you think <,> they must be Christians <,> for nobody else could look that miserable <&> laughter </&> <#> Christianity 's become an insufferably grim experience <,> and certainly in the Reform tradition that I come from you know it goes with a certain <,> the shoulder <,> one shoulder 's higher than the other <,> the neck 's a bit to the right <,> the suit 's dark <,> the glum you know glum dour look <,> and the glummer and dourer you are <,> well the holier you are <#> We can't quite cope with laughter <#> And yet laughter runs right through the heart of Scripture <#> Because do you ever notice right in the middle of the patriarchal triad of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob <,> God placed laughter <,> because Isaac literally means he laughs <#> Yitzhak is the verb behind it <,> and you can quite easily move into that from Yitzhak to Isaac <#> And you think of the spectrum of laughter there just in the life of Isaac <,> because there 's the laughter that comes the sheer incredulity of Sarah when she 's told at her age she 's going to have a child <#> And she laughs just with sheer incredulity <#> I could never <,> I could never have a child <#> And then there 's the laughter of joy when the child is born <#> And for the rest of her life and Abraham 's life and Isaac 's life they 're going to live with the fact he 's called laughter <#> Now I don't know how you can explain your way around that <,> at the very heart of God 's plan there 's this little fellow bearing the name laughter <,> and sometimes in his life he 'd little to laugh about <#> But there it 's at the heart of it <#> But Isaac reminds us of the wonderful spectrum of laughter in Scripture <,> because at another point you find when Paul 's looking at this through Galatians Paul talks about Isaac 's brother or half-brother Ishmael <,> not laughing at him but laughing <,> well not laughing with him but laughing at him <,> because that laughter can cross the spectrum and become mockery <#> Mockery that downplays <,> that deprecates <,> that treats somebody in a disrespectful way <#> So running through Scripture there 's this wonderful spectrum of <,> of laughter <#> There 's the laughter that the psalmists can talk about too <#> Can I borrow this <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> one wee minute <#> Because you get this wonderful picture <#> Remember when Israel are talking about well what God had done for them when he brought them back and and was so good to them <#> And they 're celebrating this in Psalm a hundred and twenty-six <#> And again this theme of laughter 's here when they said <,> look when the Lord brought us back to Jerusalem it was like a dream <,> how we laughed <#> How we sang for joy <#> And the other nations said about us <,> the Lord did great things for them <,> and laughter was one of the ways of expressing that <#> There 's just that laughter that that speaks of of just the wonder of what God 's done <#> If we can sing Jesus for the song in our hearts I think we can equally sing you know <,> God can put laughter in our hearts <#> But when you look at the beginning of the psalms <,> isn't it very interesting <#> When the warning is given <,> now probably some of these psalms were written to young men going into positions of leadership <,> and one of the first things the young man is warned about in Psalm one is be sure to avoid the mockers and the scoffers <,> the cynics who laugh at everything <,> for whom nothing is sacred <#> So within the psalms you get this range of of laughter too <#> And I think there 's this tremendously positive side to it in the Lord where we can enjoy him <,> but let me explore a wee bit more of the negative side too because I think we really do need to examine laughter today <#> It 's very striking that <,> you know recent historical research has shown that when Hitler was rising to power he actually had part of his government part of the Third Reich machine dedicated to creating entertainment or laughter <#> And at one stage he said <,> see to it that Germans learn to laugh again <#> But he was teaching them to laugh at home <,> there was a huge entertainment and night club <.> inter </.> uh uh you know industry in in Germany <,> but while he was teaching them to laugh it diverted their attention away from many of their you know <,> their compatriots who were dying on the various battle fronts <#> He also taught them through laughter to lower the threshold of shame <,> because when he had dehumanised the Jews enough it was very easy in in a sense to move from the caricature <,> from the cartoon <,> to move from deprecating them and dehumanising them <,> to then just obliterating them <#> Because laughter can lower the thresholds of shame to a point where there 's no shame at all and that 's one of the worrying sides of laughter <#> That sometimes <,> well <,> maybe we do need the courage like the good Ulster Prod to say no <#> We 're good at saying no an Ulster Protestant is <#> Maybe there 's some forms of laughter we have to say no to <#> See <,> if you go to the website of Blind Date <,> I don't know <,> are any of you Blind Date fans <#> It drives me batty <#> Oh I can't <,> it drives me batty <#> But if you go to the website of Blind Blind Date Cilla says <,> you know we 're looking for people who want to have fun and are good at the chat-up line and the put-down <#> You see what 's at the heart of this entertainment <#> As long as you can put somebody down <#> And entertainment has become what <,> you ever watched that bit you know where the couples come back after their date and one is talking and the one they 're talking about 's in the little window <#> Do you ever feel <,> you know you just cringe inside <#> There 's another side of you says <,> well <,> you deserve it <#> You went there on your own <#> But the other side of it is <,> look at how many of these programmes today are at the expense of someone <#> Do you ever watch the sort of that canned laughter that goes along with You 've Been Framed <#> Somebody 's falling <,> it 's obviously quite humiliating <,> quite painful <,> and then they they bring in the canned laughter <#> Or then there 's the laughter that goes along with what we call <,> as a society <,> because we can't cope with death and because we 've become embarrassed with sex <,> we 've got what 's called the alternative comedians <#> The Julian Clarys <,> the Jo Brands <#> And something like sexuality that was pure from God 's hands <,> look at the range of four-letter vocabulary terms that are now used <#> And it 's denigrated <,> it 's it 's distorted <,> it 's discoloured <,> it 's disfigured <,> and they do the same with death <#> Because they can't cope with it <,> it becomes the butt of the alternative comedian 's joke <#> Sometimes we need very very definitely to say no to laughter <,> because that 's the laughter of mockery <#> That 's the laughter that 's so lowering the thresholds of shame <,> that it 's dehumanising it 's at the expense of others <#> And I suppose as a believer I had to think a bit about laughter <#> After you know we had the full round of <,> of Lada jokes here for a long time <#> You know <,> what 's the difference between <,> you know <,> <.> wha </.> <.> wha </.> what do you call a a <,> what is it <#> Uhm oh I can't remember them now <,> actually <,> the they 've gone from a lot of them <#> There 's the Skoda ones as well <#> And then I went as I do sometimes to go to teach in the Ukraine in Eastern Europe <#> You know I never could tell a Lada joke again <#> You know when 's a Lada not a Lada <#> Well when it becomes a gift of God for somebody <,> who discovers that life 's very difficult and God makes provision for a <,> a Bible teacher away in some remote part of the Ukraine and he gets a an old battered Skoda or Lada <,> and you think of the in a sense the subtle elitism <,> the subtle middle-class superiority that creeps in when we tell our Lada jokes here <#> I just couldn't laugh any longer <#> Because there 's just some forms of laughter we have to think about <#> And yet there are other forms of laughter that are so enormously liberating <#> Cos what I 've discovered about laughter <,> especially when you <,> well again there 's all sorts of spectrums in it <#> Because if you 've travelled abroad and you go into a situation where you 're the only English speaker <,> when people start to laugh it can make you incredibly lonely <,> because you 're wondering <,> are they laughing at me <#> They 're not <,> but you can't help but feel that <#> But then there 's other times when laughter can become this wonderfully unifying thing <#> And what I 've discovered <,> especially about God 's people <,> you know the people who often do the best in foreign situations <,> they 're the people who can laugh at themselves <#> There 's something self-effacing about it but when you can laugh at yourself it says <,> I 've a confidence in God here <,> I can afford to let people laugh at me <#> And that 's what I 've discovered <#> Cos you know there 's nothing <,> any more <,> well <,> one of the great levellers I 've discovered in life <,> as I say I teach a little bit in the Ukraine now and again <,> when you 've diarrhoea in a Ukrainian train <,> and the toilet doors are locked at every station <,> and there 's no way you can sit on the seat and the train 's rattling along <,> if you can't laugh you 're in desperate trouble <#> You 're in desperate trouble <#> Because sometimes you see the Lord can put you just into situations that it takes away all your pride <#> Just all sense of your own importance <,> your own dignity <,> it 's a wonderful leveller in this sense <#> Because you discover hey <,> who <,> who do I think I am <#> When you 're caught in the midst of it <#> There 's the laughter <,> I remember one of the first times I went to the Ukraine and it was actually quite hard on the family cos you go away <,> going away 's the easy bit <,> it 's the people who are left at home have the real difficulty <,> because they 're wondering how you are <,> where you are <#> I couldn't understand before I left home and I couldn't <,> on those early trips there was no phones <,> no emails <,> I couldn't just get in touch with home <#> And I couldn't understand before I went away from home <,> I 've two daughters <,> and why Heather and the two girls were sitting <,> they were unrolling all the toilet rolls <,> and taking the the heart out <,> the core out of them <,> and then putting a pencil in and rerolling them tightly because you travel in eastern Europe you never <.> lov </.> leave home without a torch and a toilet roll <#> Those are two essentials <#> And I couldn't understand this and then one day I was standing in a necessarium at the bottom of a Ukrainian garden <,> and they had at one stage obviously got humanitarian aid because the way they decorated the toilet they had cut up all the Kellogg 's cornflakes packets and pasted them round the walls <#> And here I 'm standing <,> come in girls <,> I 'm standing in the middle of the <,> <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> in the in the toilet right down the bottom of the garden and I started to unroll the toilet roll <#> And something caught my eye <,> as I discovered the girls had started to write messages on it <#> Dad <,> we miss you <,> we love you <#> I thought you know what a wonderful way <,> they could teach the KGB about getting messages across the Iron Curtain</I>
