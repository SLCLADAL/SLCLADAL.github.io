they<S1A-036$B> <#> No well orally <&> laughter </&> <#> Not so much <,> the other <#> They 're definitely at it like<S1A-036$A> <#> Fuck<S1A-036$B> <#> And thank God now I have to say I 've never walked in on anything too serious <,> but <,> a lot of the staff have<S1A-036$A> <#> And what do they think of it like<S1A-036$B> <#> The staff can't cope with it at all <#> They<S1A-036$A> <#> But it 's their lives <#> <{> <[> They 're adults like you know </[><S1A-036$B> <#> <[> Exactly exactly </[> </{> <#> Oh I know I mean like <,> the way I should say to them you know <,> at the end of the day you have to respect your privacy <{1> <[1> <#> The </[1> two of them are <,> sane mind <#> I mean Sheila gets <,> psychiatric illnesses but she knows what she 's doing <#> She 's <{2> <[2> not you know <,> </[2> doolally or anything<S1A-036$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-036$A> <#> <[2> Yes yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-036$A> <#> Yeah <,> just horny <&> laughter </&><S1A-036$B> <#> Yeah well <,> right Sheila doesn't she craves attention <{1> <[1> <#> Do </[1> you know what I mean <#> She 's a lonely person very very quiet <,> loves doing things for people just loves people in generally <{2> <[2> <#> You know </[2> and <,> Tommy sort of gives her something to do <#> Do you know what I mean <&> laughter </&> <#> That sounds really bad <#> But Tommy 's not quite as able as she is <#> So she helps him walk <{3> <[3> and </[3><S1A-036$A> <#> <[1> Right </[1> </{1><S1A-036$A> <#> <[2> Yeah <&> laughter </&> </[2> </{2><S1A-036$A> <#> <[3> Eat </[3> </{3> this <&> laughter </&><S1A-036$B> <#> I know basically<S1A-036$A> <#> Here <,> do you want something to do <&> laughter </&><S1A-036$B> <#> I know <#> God love her <#> So I mean like <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> unbuttoned clothes like<S1A-036$A> <#> Good on them like <#> Are you supposed to knock before you go in<S1A-036$B> <#> Oh yeah <#> Right <,> this is the thing right all my staff knock <#> <{1> <[1> Right </[1> everybody knocks <{2> <[2> <,> but </[2> it 's just part and parcel of <,> of the procedure <,> you know <#> You 're told to knock in on the bedroom door before you walk in <{3> <[3> <,> but </[3> they knock and just go <{4> <[4> in </[4> instead of waiting <,> on <{5> <[5> an answer <#> Do you </[5> know what I mean <,> <#> So I mean what 's the point in knocking if you 're not going to respect <{6> <[6> the </[6> answer that you get in the first place <{7> <[7> <#> They </[7> just knock and go in <#> But in saying that I mean like nine times <{8> <[8> nine times out of ten </[8> <&> laughter </&> <#> If they were <,> they make a meal out of it <,> <#> Oh my God some of them are <,> crying and can't cope <#> I 'm not I can't work up here<S1A-036$A> <#> <[1> Right </[1> </{1><S1A-036$A> <#> <[2> Right </[2> </{2><S1A-036$A> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1A-036$A> <#> <[4> Yeah </[4> </{4><S1A-036$A> <#> <[5> To say yeah </[5> </{5><S1A-036$A> <#> <[6> Yeah </[6>

I 'd like to think <,> if I was </[2> ninety I 'd still <{3> <[3> be <,> </[3> sexually active<S1A-036$B> <#> <[1> Terrible </[1> </{1><S1A-036$B> <#> <[2> I say <,> if I were you </[2> </{2><S1A-036$B> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1A-036$B> <#> Tommy was only out of hospital on Friday with <,> he has uhm <,> chronic airways disease right <#> His breathing is fucked <#> He smoked all

sit on the bed anyway and he misjudged where the bed was and fell <#> Broke his hip <{4> <[4> and </[4> fractured his leg in three places <#> And I just knew I was like <{5> <[5> <unclear> 3 sylls
