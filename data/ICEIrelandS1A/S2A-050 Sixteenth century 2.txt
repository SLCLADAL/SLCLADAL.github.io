<S2A-050 Sixteenth century 2><I><S2A-050$A> <#> You will be my protector <#> You will be the principle Geraldine defender from now on thus embarrassing Con Bacach who 's very displeased by it <#> Had to get tough <#> Had to show form <#> And what he did was begin raiding the Pale again <#> So even as Grey was fending off these allegations of corruption and indeed of treason he had to cope with the fact that the Geraldines were themselves <,> turning against him in one way or another <#> But upon the shelving of that report and when the news began to seep through and actually all that talk of the Butlers and all that talk of people like Allen Brabazon and <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> wasn't getting anywhere <,> Grey decided to get tough <#> He had a hosting in the Pale <#> This is the first time that he 'd really demanded military service from within the Pale <#> Got a hosting and moved fast against Con Bacach O'Neill <#> Took him by surprise <,> on the borders of Monaghan in a place called Bellahoe <#> Not Bellaghy <#> We don't know exactly where Bellahoe is <#> <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> <,> and inflicted the first major defeat <,,> by an English force on <,> a Lord of Gaelic Ulster since since the time of Richard the Second I think <,,> <#> And it was on that basis of the fact that <,> a <,> he could work cheaply <,> b <,> he could withstand the hostility of the Butlers of Ormond and <,> c <,> when he wanted to he could get tough against Geraldines and even against O'Neills and put them back in their place that he sued for return to London to discuss <,> the future development of English policy in Ireland <#> By now close with Cromwell <,> he got permission to return <#> Drew up a strategy of uh a marginal increase in force <,> this secured Cromwell 's agreement on marginal increase in the subvention of government <,> uh and was well received by King Henry in May fifteen forty <#> And then it all fell apart <#> And it didn't fall apart because of O'Neill and it didn't fall apart because of Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald <,> and it didn't fall apart because of uhm <,> the Geraldine inner <#> It fell apart for reasons that had nothing at all to do with with Irish politics <#> It fell apart because of <,> one man and two women <,> Henry the Eighth <,> Catherine <,> Parr <,> and Catherine Howard <#> It fell apart when Thomas Cromwell pushed <#> No sorry not that Catherine but Anne of Cleves and Catherine Howard <#> It fell apart when Cromwell pushing forward a stronger <,> European alliance with the Lutheran princes of a holy Roman empire <,> persuaded the king <,> to agree <,> to marriage to take as his third wife now <,> busy <,> the Princess of Cleves Anne of Cleves <#> Henry uh had some doubts about it <,> he didn't like the idea of a foreign alliance <#> He secondly didn't like the idea of being pushed too far down the Lutheran way <#> He 's broken with Rome <,> but the liturgy of the Church of England is still the Catholic liturgy as of fifteen forty <#> He 's suspicious of that <#> And his suspicions were confirmed when he saw what Anne of Cleves looked like <#> He hated her <#> He thought this was an awful idea <#> And what later emerged was <,> it was a different person being presented to him in the frame in the body of Catherine Howard <,> a niece of the Duke of Norfolk <#> Remember that guy who was the Earl of Surrey and came to Ireland in the fifteen twenties who offered <,> a local marriage with a powerful aristocratic family <,> a conservative marriage on the grounds of religion and no entangling alliances <#> And apart from that he 'd a happy prospect of nights to come <#> And so <,,> Henry decided to move against Anne of Cleves <#> And so Henry decided to move <,> against Thomas Cromwell <#> And so even though he had made Thomas Cromwell Earl of Essex at the beginning of June fifteen forty a coup-d'e/tat <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> <#> And in the second week of June fifteen forty at the council table the Duke of Norfolk accused Cromwell Earl of Essex of treason <#> The King came in and indeed as uh <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> to believe that this was true <#> Cromwell was arrested <#> Yeah<S2A-050$B> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> of the Duke of Norfolk<S2A-050$A> <#> The Duke of Norfolk uh the <.> pri </.> premier peer of the realm had also had been in Ireland as the Earl of Surrey in the fifteen twenties <#> Again if you were talking about somebody with the uh A Man For All Seasons he 's the guy played by Nigel Davenport in A Man For All Seasons <#> Who you must remember <unclear> words </unclear> <#> All these <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> uh Norfolk <,,> the intent was of course to break the marriage uh proposal with Anne of Cleves <,> to establish the Howard marriage proposal <,> the Duke of Norfolk is a Howard <,> he 's Thomas Howard Duke of Norfolk <,> and to get rid of Cromwell at the same time <#> Cromwell is thrown in jail and with him is thrown in jail a whole stack of his <,> councillors <,> advisors <,> supporters <,> like for instance Sir Peter Carew in Devonshire like for instance the Viscount Lyle like for instance the Viscount Bewley all of whom go to the big <&Spanish> adios </&Spanish> in the in the months between the summer of fifteen forty and the summer of fifteen forty-one <,> <#> And likewise too his principal Irish uh <,> Leonard Grey <#> For what happened in Leonard Grey 's case was that in addition to being uhm <,> identified with the now treasonable and unacceptable Cromwellian regime <,,> the <.> fi </.> file came down from <,> the shelf <#> And all those treasonable allegations that had been quietly passed over by Cromwell <,> were not passed over by Norfolk at all <,,> and used <#> Now it may well be that the <.> dec </.> the decision to get rid of Grey as they were getting rid of a whole group of Cromwell 's henchmen uhm <,,> was <.> de </.> was determined principally uh for court for the reasons of court politics <#> But there is another factor <#> Another factor is this <,> that one of Norfolk 's principal supporters uhm <,> a courtier of no mean abilities was also a man of some Irish experience <#> And that was the man who 'd headed up that commission of enquiry <,> a man who 'd <,> gathered all those treasonable allegations and would sit <.> quiet </.> who 'd sat quietly as Cromwell said <,> thank-you very much now <,> forget about them until fifteen forty <#> I speak of Sir Anthony St Leger <#> Now St Leger is one of those figures who 's had a <,> wonderful press uh in the Irish history books <#> A kind of bright light in a naughty world <,> one who everybody thinks of him as being uh one of the few enlightened kind benign English governors who came to Ireland <#> And that may well be so <#> Uh Brendan Bradshaw has gone to uh to argue even that he was a a substantial uh <,> Renaissance intellectual <#> May well be so too but the truth is we don't know because he 's cagey enough not to write a great deal <#> Uh there is uh there is a folklore tradition that he did write uh occasional elegies of some of some wit <,> but he never wrote <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> and if he did it was never preserved <#> He doesn't say much in his letters <#> What he was <,> and this is something to bear in mind <,> in general <,> what he was was a man <,> who could get on well with the king <#> Since fifteen twenty-nine the date of the fall of Wolsey <,> and St Leger had had some private little part in that fall <,> since fifteen twenty-nine Anthony St Leger had occupied one of the most important and influential places <,,> in the Henrician court <#> You know what it was<S2A-050$X> <#> <unclear> several words </unclear><S2A-050$A> <#> No he wasn't the Lord Chancellor <#> He wasn't the Lord Treasury <#> He wasn't Lord this that or the other <#> He was <,> one of the gentlemen pensioners <#> Now what the gentlemen pensioners did <,> nice work if you can get it <,> was they went drinking with the king <,> they went whoring with the king <,> they went gambling with the king <,> they went hunting with the king <,> they went having fun with the king <#> That was their primary job <,> stay up late with the king <,> get up late with the king <,> be around when the king wants to tell the right jokes <,> laugh at the right places cry at the right places <#> St Leger <,> Surrey <,> Thomas White all had done this kind of thing and St Leger was particularly successful at <#> And I think it is St Leger 's <,> remarkable closeness with Henry the Eighth <#> You can see this in his correspondence <#> I can't see great humanist ideas in the correspondence but what I can see are jokes and in sending over horses to the king and in sending over goshawks to the king and sending him up what hunting was like in Ireland to the king all which indicates that the connection <,> isn't political isn't ideological but was personal and intimate <#> And it was by the way as intimate of the king <,> you know the king liked to have fun through the fifteen thirties that St Leger had acquired substantial monastic estates <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> in Kent not only for himself but for his <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear><S2A-050$X> <#> <unclear> several words </unclear><S2A-050$A> <#> Sorry <,> <#> I did indeed yeah <#> Uhm <,> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> the races and he was very good with the gee-gees <,> St Leger <&> writes on board </&> <,,> <#> To be honest I actually think it 's pronounced Salinger as J D Salinger well if that 's I think a derivation from it but it 's spelt St Leger so we 'll keep it like that <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> <#> But if you want to call him Salinger that 's fine by me <,,> <#> Nevertheless in <,> July fifteen forty even as Grey was languishing in the tower and he 'd another eleven months to go before they had done their time for <,> for treason uh even as Grey was doing this St Leger pursued the Irish office <#> And although he might say that 's a great idea <,> I 'm very pleased with this indeed <,> the old problems still remained <#> And in many ways the old problems <,> are now worse <#> Consider it <#> He 'd replaced Grey who for all his faults at least had been cheap <#> Now was St Leger going to be any more expensive <#> Appoint me King Henry and I 'll be better but I 'll be a lot more expensive though <#> So the imperative of being <,> economical of practising fiscal austerity remained every bit as firm under the new regime as it had been under the old <#> Secondly the Geraldines weren't too pleased at all you know <#> Just as they thought they 'd made some kind of unsteady relationship with uh <,> with Grey and they 'd lost it <#> And they had this new guy to see to and that 's not nice at all <#> And one of the nasty straws in the wind was that as Grey fell and before St Leger came the Geraldines spirited away <,> the young Kildare pair <,> first to Paris then to Florence <#> Nobody was going to catch them now <#> But the third problem was perhaps the worst of all <#> You notice the guys <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> hadn't they <#> The <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> upgrade the Butlers <,> the English administrators who sought his head on a block in fifteen thirty-seven and had to wait about two and a half years to get it and at long last got it they had been scalped <#> They <,> could destroy an English viceroy <#> So here we are again in fifteen forty the way they were in fifteen thirty-six <#> What would St Leger do <#> What would you do now <,,><S2A-050$B> <#> Spend lots of money<S2A-050$A> <#> Oh yes <#> I think that 's a smart way to go but you know how do you do that without being in uh not getting into trouble <#> He doesn't have to spend lots of money <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> but what he did in the first instance was to establish a framework within which it was possible <,> for this kind of benign administration to be <,> initiated <#> And the framework he established was the framework I spoke about earlier in lecture one <,> a framework of <,> the constitution of revolution <,> the new kingdom of Ireland established by statute by an Irish statute and an Irish parliament in <,> June fifteen forty-one</I>
