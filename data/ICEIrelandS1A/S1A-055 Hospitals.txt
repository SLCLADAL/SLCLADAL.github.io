laughter </&><S1A-055$A> <#> <.> Su </.> <.> su </.> such a change from what we were growing up with <#> When you think about it people had bad visions of the <{> <[> home </[><S1A-055$D> <#> <[>

<[> that it </[><S1A-055$D> <#> <[> No </[> </{> I don't think that <#> No no this now is <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> graveyard<S1A-055$A> <#> <{> <[> Right </[><S1A-055$B> <#> <[> In </[> </{>

<[2> <unclear> several words </unclear> </[2> <#> They got Mass said there and they <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> now <#> They 'd no flowers <{3> <[3> <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> </[3><S1A-055$D> <#> <[1> Oh he he still is </[1> </{1><S1A-055$A> <#> <[2> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[2> </{2><S1A-055$B> <#> <[3> And now the </[3> </{3> luxury they die in like<S1A-055$A> <#> Yeah<S1A-055$E> <#> But isn't <{> <[> it only right </[><S1A-055$B> <#> <[> I </[> </{> I think it 's 'tis geared for death you know like<S1A-055$A> <#> Mm<S1A-055$B> <#> That they 're getting no time in a general

<#> But it 's very important<S1A-055$B> <#> Oh it is<S1A-055$E> <#> I think it 's awful important that people can die with dignity <{> <[> you know </[><S1A-055$B> <#> <[> Yeah and </[> </{> 'tis

<#> <[2> <unclear> 10 sylls </unclear> </[2> </{2><S1A-055$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-055$D> <#> <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> twenty-five thousand now <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear><S1A-055$B> <#> Twenty thousand <,> with the curtains and <,> all that <#> And all that 's going to be repainted now again <#> They could still close it in two years ' time<S1A-055$A> <#> Why why would you close it is it<S1A-055$B> <#> Yerra no but you see that <,> it would be cheaper now to subsidise patients in a nursing home <,> as to to be paying staff in a hospital and <,> paying kitchen staff and all the rest<S1A-055$A> <#> But<S1A-055$B> <#> But still <{> <[> yerra I wouldn't </[><S1A-055$D> <#> <[> They haven't </[> </{> the care<S1A-055$A> <#> But I uh are are are all these nursing homes the

know<S1A-055$B> <#> I 'd say the nursing homes really<S1A-055$A> <#> They 're out to make the money for a start anyway <#> Sure they 're they 're <{> <[> they 're not </[><S1A-055$B> <#> <[> Uh uh </[> </{> a lot of them say that they aren't even making money <,> unless they 're full all the time <#> <{> <[> That place now in Foynes </[> <#> Yeah <,> and the heating and everything<S1A-055$A> <#> <[> I suppose if if they 're big </[> </{><S1A-055$D> <#> But sure one hundred and twenty or one hundred and thirty pound <unclear> several words </unclear> <,> no matter if they only charged

even for for <unclear> several words </unclear> <#> Those that are not on the pension they can keep that <unclear> several words </unclear><S1A-055$B> <#> Well there shouldn't like she wants <,> what they do is they they keep some of their their pension and <.> un </.> until they have twelve hundred built up like for <,> burial <,> and a person has that much built up <,> and a lot of them have good lot of money <#> You know even though they 'd only get maybe a <,> what do they get back out of the pension <#> Varying but they could get as much as twenty pound back out of the pension <#> But

them there ten or twenty years isn't there<S1A-055$B> <#> Yeah said you 'd be surprised how it builds up <#> And then we 'll say a lot of <,> a lot of them then <,> would leave a a share of money and wouldn't have much after them <#> So we give a novena of Mass is said for them while they 're living <#> And well they 've everything thought of really <#> <{> <[> But uh </[><S1A-055$A> <#> <[> Some of those ones </[> </{> have fairly big money too <#> Have they <&> cough </&><S1A-055$B> <#> Oh they do<S1A-055$A> <#> There 's that Tommy Byrne <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> <#> He was never poor

<unclear> 10 sylls </unclear> <#> He 'd live on the <,> milk of a cow and and a hen and <{1> <[1> you know </[1> and that 'd do him <&> laughter </&> <#> In actual fact he never <,> <{2> <[2> spent a

</{2><S1A-055$B> <#> Wouldn't he <#> Yeah<S1A-055$A> <#> Yeah cos <{> <[> he <&> laughter </&> </[><S1A-055$E> <#> <[> When you </[> </{> think of the way it went for <{> <[> God 's sake </[><S1A-055$A> <#> <[> I know </[> </{> <#> Aye sure that that 's the point I 'm making <#> It 's it 's a pity like <#> I felt sorry in a way for him<S1A-055$D> <#> And how did it go<S1A-055$A> <#> Well <,> my sister got a good lot of it <{> <[> anyway </[> <#> The family got bits of it too like<S1A-055$E> <#> <[> Rosie </[> </{><S1A-055$E> <#> Yeah<S1A-055$A> <#> But wouldn't he be

anyway <#> You needn't worry <&> laughter </&><S1A-055$A> <#> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> everyone got a thousand from him anyway<S1A-055$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-055$A> <#> Like that 's why <unclear> 2

</[> </{><S1A-055$B> <#> Yes <,> malnutrition<S1A-055$E> <#> Hypothermia<S1A-055$A> <#> Hypothermia was it<S1A-055$E> <#> And his blood sugar was real low <#> They thought he was after going into

several sylls </unclear> <#> The house had gone down so much <#> You know <{1> <[1> that 's the reason <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[1> roof dropped out eventually that there was <{2> <[2> no
