<S2A-020 World Cup return><I><S2A-020$A> <#> And as you join us you can see the huge crowd gathered here in College Green <#> I must say that I have never seen anything like the size of the crowd I 've never seen anything like the enthusiasm <#> And they 've been waiting here for four or five hours most of them <#> And just drink in that atmosphere <#> It really is quite fantastic <#> The road from Rome <,> leading to Westmoreland Street <#> And the crowds who 've been waiting some of them from two o'clock this afternoon <,> giving vent to their emotions and their enthusiasm <#> And I 'm sure that Jack Charlton and the rest of the team have never ever experienced anything quite like this <#> We heard saw Jack there at the airport almost lost for words <#> But look at this <#> As the bus carrying the team and the officials and the players <#> Is almost enveloped in the sea of emotion as the citizens of Dublin representing the citizens of Ireland offer their congratulations <,> and show them the only way they can <,> with enthusiasm and good humour <#> And one can't help but feel a lump in one 's throat watching this unbridled enthusiasm and good spirits <#> And as we were saying earlier on the achievement of the team and Jack Charlton has been one of success against the odds <,> success where people didn't expect them to succeed and the giving of not just a hundred percent of effort <,> but a hundred and fifty percent each man in each game <#> The excitement of that incredible draw against England in the opening game when Kevin Sheedy got the equaliser and I 'm sure that the cheers for that reached mammoth proportions on any Richter Scale <#> There was a bit of a disappointment in the performance against Egypt but the draw got us a valuable point <#> And then came that remarkable comeback against the Netherlands when Niall Quinn got in for that dramatic equaliser and that was the goal that saw Ireland getting into the last sixteen <#> Paul McGrath we saw there so delighted and listen to the crowd chanting the Paul McGrath rap <,,> <#> I think that bus is going to take a long time to get the last few yards into the College Green centre <,> <#> Because if the crowd behind the bus looks pretty dense on our television screen I can tell you that the crowd in front of the bus is even more dense <#> Fantastic <#> And it really was <#> John Aldridge there who ran so much in all of those games and caused the opposing defences so many problems <#> And I 'd say Jack seems to be more concerned about the safety of the spectators as they cheer and get so close to the bus <#> But it really is an impossible task for the drivers <#> I mean look at that <#> That is the scene that awaits them as they come round the corner of College Green <#> In front of Trinity College <,> in the background is Trinity College and there <,> vantage points in the windows <,> on the roof of Trinity College <,> rooves around College Green occupied as fans <,> wave flags and offer their congratulations <,,> <#> One looks back at that remarkable victory over Romania when the game went to penalties and I remember looking at the picture of Jack Charlton when Packie Bonner made the save and there was that ruthless smile on his face as much as to say <,> I knew it all along <#> And when nobody really gave the Republic of Ireland a chance against Italy <,> Jack Charlton was uhm able to say <,> we 'll put the pressure on them <#> They 're going to have to change their game and they 're going to know they 've been in a match <#> And indeed that was so true because having enjoyed that match disappointed that Ireland didn't get the result that they 'd wanted but <,> we all know that the Irish team gave the fancied Italians a real fright <,,> <#> And so the bus inches its way and Jack more concerned about the safety of the people who have been waiting to welcome them <&> crowd sings </&> <#> And the anthem of Italia ninety <,> as it has been sung the length and breadth of Ireland in the last few weeks greets Jack Charlton and the Republic of Ireland team <#> This has been the biggest ever civic reception in the history of Dublin <#> No warmer reception has ever been made and there 's an interesting picture <#> At Jack Charlton 's right hand <,> David O'Leary <#> The man who had the strength of character and courage with that final penalty <,> to shoot to the right and get it into the net and bring Ireland into the quarter finals <#> A man that many people thought had the strength of character to be in the side and when called upon he was equal to the occasion <,> <#> It really is difficult to describe the enthusiasm and the scenes <#> The youngsters in Ireland who have been so well behaved as they waited for so long and now the moment has come when they can see Packie Bonner <,> they can see Dave O'Leary <,> they can see the Irish side <#> Joe Delaney who is in charge of security <#> There he is trying to wave them back and say <,> my job isn't over yet <#> And the enthusiasm that the Irish supporters brought right round Italy from Cagliari to Palermo to Genoa and then to Rome is now seen in all its <.> in </.> exuberance as it was back home during those thrilling and exciting matches in the preliminary stages and then in the heat final and last night in the quarter-final <#> These were the scenes that all of us enjoyed in so many <.> s </.> hostelries as Ireland really celebrated the magnificent performance of a team that will be remembered <#> On the platform you see the MC 's trying to get a little bit of order and make room for the honoured guests who are of course the Irish team <#> And <&Irish> An </&Irish> Ta/naiste Brian Lenihan there and of course the <,> this being a joint civic and State reception <#> The <,> Dublin Corporation of course represented by Senator Sean Haughey the Lord Mayor of Dublin <,> the government represented by all the official ministers and the Ta/naiste Brian Lenihan the senior <.> digan </.> dignatory from the government at the moment on the stand <,> <#> And the band that has been encouraging the <,> and entertaining the huge crowd all afternoon <,> still going strong <#> And welcoming the Irish team <#> And there <,> I was mentioning about the vantage points around College Green <#> Well just <,> look at that for enthusiasm <,> for excitement <,> for joy <,> and for welcome <#> And Jack Charlton said after the European Championships <,> who knows what it would be like if they won something <#> Well they 're everywhere aren't they showing that Ireland have won the hearts of world soccer with their performances in the World Cup <,> their first time ever in the World Cup <#> Their supporters who travelled with them in spite of the lack of tickets and were in such good humour around the world or around Italy <#> Won the hearts of all their opponents <#> Frank Stapleton <,> one of the great servants of Irish football who would love so much to have been a part of the actual playing <,> Liam Rapple one of the great stalwarts of the FAI also there <,> and the Lord Mayor present and enjoying the excitement as Jack Charlton acknowledges the cheers that have been rising deafeningly from College Green all afternoon and now reaching a crescendo <#> David O'Leary almost a little worried wondering how they 're going to make it Andy Townsend beside him <#> Every inch of the way <,> the crowd cheer them as the team bus stops outside the Bank of Ireland where this team reception will be held <#> And while we look at the <,> and remember the heroics of Packie Bonner and Dave O'Leary and Mick McCarthy the captain <,> and Kevin Moran in the defence and the efforts of Tony Cascarino <,> the goals of Niall Quinn and Kevin Sheedy <#> We also remember the players who were also in the panel but didn't get on the field to play <#> We remember <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> we remember Gerry Peyton the reserve goalkeeper <,> the first man to congratulate Packie Bonner when he made that marvellous save in the match against Romania <#> Tony Butler <,> the promotions executive of the FAI who has done such wonders for the FAI <,> in terms of generating sponsorship <#> Joe Delaney there as well <#> The players <,> really concerned I 'd say as to how the bus is going to make its way through to the entrance to the bank which is in Foster Place <#> The officials trying to say to them to hold their positions <,> Steve Staunton <,> Liam Rapple there behind him <#> And look at the enthusiasm <#> The players really enjoying this remarkable occasion <#> Frank Feely <,> the Dublin City Manager must be proud of the way Dublin has risen to this occasion <#> Nobody could have expected this <#> And Dublin 's own Niall Quinn <,> the scorer of that great goal against Holland <,> and he took the rebound from the Dutch keeper and struck it safely home <#> And that was the valuable point that saw Ireland getting through from the preliminaries <#> But we remember too the great contribution of all the players who played in ensuring that Ireland would get through to the World Cup finals for the first time <#> Many of those in the panel but not used in the course of the games played in Italy <,> but they were there supporting and ready to step in if required <#> And as any football manager will tell you <,> the support players <,> the other players in the panel <,> every bit as important to the success of the team as the players on the field <,,> <#> The scene in Dame Street <,> looking up Dame Street with the Bank of Ireland on your right <#> And the noise <,> the shouting <,> and the cheering really reflecting the views of everybody in Ireland who are so proud of the marvellous effort made by Jack Charlton made by the players in the course of Ireland 's first ever performance or appearance in the World Cup finals <#> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> the assistant manager and this is Bibi Baskin <,,><&> break in commentary </&><S2A-020$A> <#> Thank-you Bibi <#> Certainly the excitement and enthusiasm has uh caught everyone 's imagination and uh it 's been really hard to hear even what one 's thinking and uh Bibi up there in the middle of all that excitement uh really finding it difficult to uhm even hear herself <#> But what can one say looking at those exciting pictures <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> these joyful pictures <,> with so many people who 've spent so long in College Green waiting to say <,> well done <,> waiting to show their appreciation and enthusiasm now that they have their chance <#> They 're not going to let it go by <#> It 's been a long hard day I should imagine <,> for the players <#> There was a disappointment for them last night that they didn't get the result that they really believed they could achieve <#> And it 's only understandable that there was a slight feeling of disappointment this morning <#> But I 'm sure all that has been really brushed aside by the nature of the welcome that they received at Dublin Airport and all the way in from Dublin Airport this has been the sort of smiling cheering crowds that they have seen <#> It 's been the slowest journey into Dublin Airport into the centre of Dublin I 'm sure in history I 'm really sure it 's probably been the happiest <#> We talked about vantage points <#> I 'm not too sure that that 's the safest place in the world to be but they 're going to have a good view when eventually the players get in to Foster Place <#> And I think it 's also fair to say this morning that the spectators and the crowds here have been so well-behaved <&> band plays </&></I>
