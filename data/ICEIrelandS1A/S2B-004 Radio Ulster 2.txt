<S2B-004 Radio Ulster 2><I><S2B-004$A> <#> Twenty-six minutes past eight now <#> The Pope has written to bishops in the United States expressing pain and worry over a barrage of cases of child sex abuse by priests <#> The number of priests involved is about four hundred <#> That 's around one percent of all American Catholic priests <,> and the Pope who 's planning to visit the continent in August has accused some media of sensationalism <#> A Vatican spokesman said the percentage of priests involved may be less than that of other sectors of the general population <#> But the Vatican and the bishops are clearly worried and the bishops are said to be unhappy with the Vatican 's attitude <#> The Vatican has rejected suggestions that guilty priests should be sacked without appeal <#> Meanwhile the bishops have recommended a wide-ranging programme <,> including paying for therapy for victims <#> The final cost to the church will be millions of dollars in lawsuits but as Kevin Cullen of the Boston Globe newspaper told Paddy O'Flaherty <,> it 's proving impossible to establish the scale of the problem<&> interrupted story </&><S2B-004$B> <#> Within the past hour the security forces have removed a man 's body <#> It had been lying thirty yards inside the border in an isolated area near Killeter outside Castlederg <,> for the past twenty-four hours <#> Throughout the day there was a heavy security force presence in the area and helicopters checked the countryside for booby-trapped devices <#> The RUC have made no comment yet about the identity of the victim <,> but it 's understood he was a twenty-three year old man from the Beechmount area of West Belfast <#> It 's believed a priest contacted a family there at the request of the police to ask if their

consequences of Mr Mates ' resignation here 's our political editor Jim Dougal<S2B-004$C> <#> Mr Mates ' resignation means that within the past month Sir Patrick Mayhew has lost his two most senior ministers <,> Jeremy Hanley promoted from Political Development to the Armed Services Department <,> and now Michael Mates gone from Security and Finance <#> Since the storm broke over Mr Mates ' gift of a watch to the fugitive tycoon Asil Nadir <,> and allegations that he had persistently lobbied the Attorney General over his prosecution <,> the affair has been an embarrassment to the Stormont Law and Order Minister <#> The wider row over contributions to the Conservative Party also ensured that Mr Mates ' relationship with Mr Nadir continued to be highlighted <,> eventually making his position untenable <#> His resignation could not come at a worse time for Sir Patrick Mayhew <#> As he attempts to get the political parties in the Province back to the negotiating table his minister for Political Development <,> Michael Ancram is new to the job and is still reading himself in <#> He 's likely to be left in a similar position in the sensitive Security Ministry <#> Tonight Sir Patrick

now been cleared and the M1 is also opened but there are still delays heading to Broadway <#> Finally the area around the Kings Hall has has also been cleared but this has left heavy traffic congestion in the Boucher Road<S2B-004$A> <#> The weather dry with sunny spells some drizzle in the west by morning minimum temperatures eight or nine Celsius</I><I><S2B-004$D> <#> Traffic across

lane closures on the main Larne dual carriageway between Corr 's Corner and the Doagh Road <#> Delays are likely so passengers should allow extra time for the journey <#> And drivers are warned to be careful in the vicinity of the roadworks on the M1 between Moira and Sprucefield <,> where the contra-flow is still in operation <#> The Maracycle left Belfast Kings Hall at seven thirty this morning <#> This will affect traffic on the main Belfast to Newry Road as the race heads south <#> Finally at the International Airport the Air Canada flight AC096 from Toronto <,> that 's due into Belfast at

as normal<S2B-004$E> <#> Thank-you Tina <#> It 's not the kind of morning when you 'd want to leave the studio I have to say <,> rather grey and cool but what are the prospects <#> Donald Campbell 's on the line from the Met Office at Aldergrove <#> Good morning again Donald<S2B-004$F> <#> Good morning <#> Uh not too bad <#> There is a lot of cloud around as you say at the moment but it 's uh quite a nice morning otherwise <#> That cloud will thin and break for a time and I think we 'll see some good sunny spells later this morning and into the afternoon <#> It will turn more cloudy once again from the west and uh there will be some rain reaching the far west this evening <,> and it will spread slowly to all parts overnight tonight<S2B-004$E> <#> Well now what about the outlook Donald<S2B-004$F> <#> The outlook <#> It 's actually going to be quite warm uh <,> tomorrow and Sunday and uh into the start of next week <,> but uh I think there 'll be a lot of cloud around initially tomorrow and and at first on Sunday <#> But uh the emphasis still on a lot of dry weather<S2B-004$E> <#> That 's good to hear <,> and thank-you very much for it <#> That was Donald Campbell

approached him <#> David Morgan reports<S2B-004$H> <#> The fifty-seven year old council worker was murdered outside his home at Lime Grove by two gunmen dressed in cycling clothes <#> Apparently Mr Lyness saw them approach and drew his own weapon but was killed before he could defend himself <#> The gunmen then fled on bicycles through Lurgan Park <#> Mr Lyness had served with the Ulster Defence Regiment for twenty years but left about twelve months ago <#> Church of Ireland Rector Ken Goods spoke to the murdered man 's family after the shooting <,> and he 's appealed for no retaliation for the killing<S2B-004$I> <#> I would certainly discourage any kind of retaliation <,> or any kind of impulsive action <,> and I know that the family wouldn't want this sort of grief and horror uh to happen to any other innocent family<S2B-004$H> <#> Detectives investigating the murder want to hear from anyone who may have seen the two killers cycle away from the scene of the shooting <#> They
