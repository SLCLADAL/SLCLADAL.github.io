chance<S1A-039$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-039$A> <#> What do you see yourself working as out there<S1A-039$B> <#> You see my intentions is to get my degree <#> Right<S1A-039$A> <#> Right<S1A-039$B> <#> Get my degree <,> and then go to a different country to see if I can get a job with my degree<S1A-039$A> <#> Mhm<S1A-039$B> <#> But sure even if I didn't <,> in the meantime while I was waiting or whatever get a pop at <,> another job <,> a handy job yeah<S1A-039$A> <#> Mm <#> Say <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> do like the scaffolding or something <{> <[> or even labouring </[><S1A-039$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> yeah <#> I mean it brings money in <#> Pay the rent<S1A-039$A> <#> Mm <#> What sure what part of <.> A </.> Australia would you go to<S1A-039$B> <#> I wouldn't have a clue <#> Don't know anything about <,> I don't know much about Australia like to tell you the truth <#> Sure <,> <.> S </.> Sydney would be the spot to go wouldn't it<S1A-039$A> <#> Mhm<S1A-039$B> <#> Paul the boys were saying <,> that <,> it 's fucking it 's a lovely country like <,> lovely scenery and that<S1A-039$A> <#> Mm<S1A-039$B> <#> And <,> the women over there 's <,> top notch boy <&> laughter </&> <#> Eh<S1A-039$A> <#> Baywatch all over<S1A-039$B> <#> Oh will you stop <#> Nicest looking women in the world<S1A-039$A> <#> Bondi Beach<S1A-039$B> <#> Yeah <#> Big white beaches and <,> everything <#> Nude beaches <,> the whole lot<S1A-039$A> <#> But if things <.> w </.> didn't work out would you be straight back home<S1A-039$B> <#> No <,> <#> Well if it was <,> if it wasn't too bad <#> If it was bad like <{> <[> I wouldn't get </[><S1A-039$A> <#> <[> That you couldn't </[> </{> get work and you were just stone broke<S1A-039$B> <#> Well like that would be really bad like<S1A-039$A> <#> Mm<S1A-039$B> <#> Right if I couldn't if I 'd no money <,> and it was really bad I 'd have no choice but go home <#> But if it wasn't too bad if I was sort of in in and out of jobs like <,> I would <,> I would sort of make an attempt to stay as long as I could you know<S1A-039$A> <#> Mm<S1A-039$B> <#> Needn't go rushing back home<S1A-039$A> <#> What sort of a timeframe do you see yourself staying out there<S1A-039$B> <#> It 's like everything else like <,> you could go there and <,> get landed into some big job and you could set up a house and<S1A-039$A> <#> And maybe stay for the rest of your life<S1A-039$B> <#> Stay for the rest of your life <#> You know meet some <,> some Australian girl<S1A-039$A> <#> Would you go illegal <#> You 'd have to<S1A-039$B> <#> What do you mean go illegal<S1A-039$A> <#> You 'd have no Green Card<S1A-039$B> <#> What do you mean <#> See that 's another thing I don't know about you see<S1A-039$A> <#> You see Australia has very stringent immigration laws<S1A-039$B> <#> Yeah well what 's the maximum uh term you could stay there<S1A-039$A> <#> Six months I think<S1A-039$B> <#> And then you have to come home <#> Or how do you get your Green Card<S1A-039$A> <#> Well there 's <,> there 's certain ways of going about it <#> You can apply for one or else if you marry an Australian <,> you get a Green Card <#> You can also get it if you 're working over there<S1A-039$B> <#> You see <,> six months like <,> that 's the sort of <,> that 's the sort of uh <,> time that I would want to stay you know <#> I 'd I 'd I want to stay a year at the least <,> just to make an impression you know <,> just to say I was there for a year<S1A-039$A> <#> Do you know anybody that was over there for a year<S1A-039$B> <#> Uh <,> I do <#> But they couldn't get jobs <#> They says <,> all over the country they were applying for jobs <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <#> They got a car <#> They bought a car <#> They said they met a boy in a pub <,> says that fruit picking or something like that there <,> but it was on the other side of Australia <,> three hundred mile away more <#> So they bought a an oul stink of a car with their last bean <#> Right <&> laughter </&> <#> They went up they went up to this this place anyway <#> Ended up there was no job <#> That was them stuck <#> They 'd no money <,> they 'd an oul banger of a car<S1A-039$A> <#> And stuck in this place<S1A-039$B> <#> Stuck <,> stuck in the<S1A-039$A> <#> No money for a fare home or anything<S1A-039$B> <#> And the people that they were over with <,> that they knew well from <{1> <[1> Camlough </[1> they <,> sort of knew <,> things were sort of tight you know and they knew who their friends were there you see <#> <{2> <[2> Because </[2> there was so many things going on you know <#> And then <,> they were working and they wouldn't give them money and <,> wouldn't feed them or nothing <#> And these boys were nearly starving like <#> They <.> we </.> they were starving actually cos I was talking to them <#> And they came back home <,> and told us all about it about how they met these people really these people were <{3> <[3> and </[3> how they let them down <,> you know<S1A-039$A> <#> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1><S1A-039$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-039$A> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1A-039$A> <#> That 's usually what happens when you 're against the wall<S1A-039$B> <#> Yeah and it 's your problem<S1A-039$A> <#> But does that not put you off<S1A-039$B> <#> It did like <,> <#> It does surely <#> Uh you know <,> but see even my brother over in America <,> he was <,> he was stuck with no house or nothing to go to <#> Like he slept out rough for a day <,> one week <{1> <[1> until </[1> a a girl D'Arcy brought him in <#> He was shitting himself <#> He didn't know what to do <#> <{2> <[2> He was over </[2> in a different country in this big massive city <,> didn't know what was going on or nothing <,> nowhere to stay <,> was promised all this here and <,> nowhere to stay <,> no nothing just came through at all<S1A-039$A> <#> <[1> You 're joking </[1> </{1><S1A-039$A> <#> <[2> Why was he so </[2> </{2><S1A-039$A> <#> Why was he so unprepared<S1A-039$B> <#> See he thought he was going over there and <,> he was going over to stay in somebody 's house and <,> things was all organised <#> They weren't half organised as they thought they were <#> So our Phil was dying to get away and that <#> So they they <.> pla </.> planned nearly a month before it <,> you know <#> But sure whenever he went over there everything just went into a big flop <#> Nothing really planned at all <#> Good good enough for your girl <,> she brought him in like <#> She fed and watered him til he did get himself back on his feet <#> But now now he is <,> now he 's got his own apartment <,> got a girl and all over there a girlfriend<S1A-039$A> <#> American<S1A-039$B> <#> She 's not American <#> She 's from Cork <#> And uhm he 's got a good job <#> Well he hasn't a good job he 's got <,> he it 's not a good job but it 's good money <#> But the worst thing with jobs in different countries is that you 're <.> guarn </.> you 're not guaranteed <,> you could have a week 's work and that 'd be it <#> And then <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> you 're told <,> no matter how good of a worker you were <,> the work could just dry up <,> just dry<S1A-039$A> <#> So you have to work like fuck<S1A-039$B> <#> Yeah you 've no choice in the matter<&> new conversation </&><S1A-039$B> <#> So how are you getting on yourself down in Belfast Peggy Anne<S1A-039$C> <#> Well I like it <#> Like I 'm glad I 'm down here <#> You know for a while I was worrying you know while I was doing my A levels <,> that I wouldn't get in at all<S1A-039$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-039$C> <#> Thankfully I passed and <,> I 'm up <#> I was very worried about the accommodation <,> you know cos I had <.> ha </.> applied to halls <{> <[> when </[> and I never got in<S1A-039$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-039$B> <#> And how do you sort of cope with the change from the lot of <,> you know the way up in Belfast you 've a lot more independence and that <,> how do you feel that you 're coping to that<S1A-039$C> <#> Well like without <,> do you mean without your mummy <,> and daddy<S1A-039$B> <#> Yeah <#> Like you 're standing on your own two feet now like <,> even in terms of like you know socially and that like going out and<S1A-039$C> <#> Well socially I don't find it too bad because you 're always used to interacting with other people anyway <,> and you don't really have your mother and father sort of guiding you through in that respect <#> But now <,> economically and all when you 're dealing with budgets for your money and finance and all like <,> I struggled at the start you know <#> When I first got my loan <,> initially I just went to Top Shop River Island Oasis <&> laughter </&> and uh you know <,> blew the lot you know in <,> well blew quite a bit in the first couple of weeks <#> But it was just as time progressed <,> now I realised I had to sort of<S1A-039$B> <#> You became more astute<S1A-039$C> <#> Yeah <#> More </.> mo </.> money management was needed <,> you know when you 're paying your rent every so often<S1A-039$B> <#> What about in your own house <#> Do you feel cosy or<S1A-039$C> <#> Well <,> I I when I first came up I didn't feel it <,> it wasn't like a home <#> I suppose it it was in like it 's <,> only an empty shell but when you move in all your stuff and <,> bits and bobs from the house then <#> If you get on well with your friends as well I think you can make anything a home <#> Now <,> it 's a standard house <#> It 's rather basic as you can see but <,> we try our best<S1A-039$B> <#> It does youse like<S1A-039$C> <#> No complaints<S1A-039$B> <#> No <#> What about your course <#> How are you finding that<S1A-039$C> <#> It 's not too bad <#> Initially when I first went down <,> <.> whe </.> when I was you know just trying to grasp what was going on and like they really did throw us in at the deep end <,> because all this reading and all like you 're meant do to <,> you 're not told <,> you know in school you 're so spoon-fed<S1A-039$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-039$C> <#> You 're like <,> if you have homework you 're told <#> If you 've assignments you 're told when to hand them in and you 're helped in that respect <#> But <,> up here you 're just expected to read the handbooks <&> laughter </&> and <,> right you 've got an assignment due on such a date and no-one 's going to keep telling you <,> <{> <[> it has to be in </[> <#> No-one 's going to <,> reinforce the fact that you know if you don't have it in you 're dead<S1A-039$B> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><S1A-039$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-039$C> <#> Nobody cares up here like <#> You have to it has to be your own initiative <,> do everything on your own initiative <#> It 's <,> like I suppose you 're reading for a degree but I I really did not understand that until about five weeks into the course <&> laughter </&> when I was kind of struggling and realised that I had an awful lot of work ahead of me to catch up <#> And the fact that I 've never done accounts before and a lot of people in the class have already <,> perhaps done maybe four years of accountancy <{1> <[1> or </[1> accounts <#> They have a four years accounting background <,> you know through GCSE and A <{2> <[2> level </[2> <#> Well I was <,> like I would be classed then as a weak student <.> compare </.> in comparison to them <{3> <[3> <,> so </[3> inevitably I 'm <,> well<S1A-039$B> <#> <[1> Mm mm </[1> </{1><S1A-039$B> <#> <[2> Mm mm </[2> </{2><S1A-039$B> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1A-039$B> <#> You 're playing catch-up<S1A-039$C> <#> Yeah <#> Big style<S1A-039$B> <#> What way do see yourself uh for these exams coming up<S1A-039$C> <#> Ah I just have an awful lot of revision to do over the Christmas period <#> Now whether I get that put in or not is another story <#> But <,> when I think about it in the long term I don't particularly want to do repeats in August <,> so I 'll try <,> och I 'd say if you do a couple of hours here and a couple of hours there<S1A-039$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-039$C> <#> Perhaps it<S1A-039$B> <#> Suffice anyway<S1A-039$C> <#> Yeah<S1A-039$B> <#> What about your assignments and all <#> Have you everything your courseworks and that done<S1A-039$C> <#> Well thankfully I got eighty percent in my economics so I was over the moon with that <#> I 'd be <,> I 'm like rather good with reading <.> mat </.> material <#> If it 's just a question and I just have to read up about it <{> <[> if </[> it 's just a like applying things I I can do that no bother <#> It 's just actually sitting down revising <#> I have no patience <,> you know<S1A-039$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-039$B> <#> Do you think that 's your concentration span <{> <[> or is it like </[><S1A-039$C> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> <#> Well it 's not that <#> It 's <,> I just uh <,> I have no discipline<S1A-039$B> <#> Mm<S1A-039$C> <#> I just have to get into a routine <,> a regular routine <#> And I I know if I kept up that type of pattern I 'd be fine <#> It 's just starting it<S1A-039$B> <#> Yeah <#> Do you find it 's easier to study up here or at home or <,> have you got you know<S1A-039$C> <#> Well at the weekend at home I work <#> So and <,> I 've a hectic social life <#> So I 've to try and keep on top of things up here <#> And <,> you can do <,> whatever you have to do you have to do it in the university <,> because I know when you come back to this house <,> <{1> <[1> it 's total relaxation </[1> <#> Yeah <#> Definitely you just veg in front of the TV <#> Because there 's <,> well like at home I lived in the country as you know and <,> I 've been so used to never having a neighbour <,> and <&> laughter </&> a proper neighbour <,> you know one of my friends or something <{2> <[2> that </[2> I can call over <,> to talk to or whatever <#> And <,> now I 'm up in Belfast and all my friends are rather close<S1A-039$B> <#> <[1> Too many distractions </[1> </{1><S1A-039$B> <#> <[2> Mm </[2> </{2></I>
