<S1B-011 Workforce 1><I><S1B-011$A> <#> So <,> in conclusion regarding human resource planning <,> let us consider these <,,> <#> <&Spanish> Numero uno </&Spanish> <,> we now have fifty-eight percent of the employed population in services <,> or service industry <,,> <#> What is a service industry <#> One example is what I 'm doing today <#> Education will be a service <,> so anybody employed in universities <,> RTCs <,> DITs <,> ABCs <,> XYZeds <,> would be counted to be in <,> the service industry except <,> Mr Walsh that <,,> in your case <,> you 're a public employee so I would probably be categorised as a state employee <#> Anyhow it 's a technicality <#> Another service example would be <,,> hotels <,> of course <#> Some of you are actually in these <#> You don't even know the industry you 're in <,,> <#> And that would contrast with people like Walsh 's Bread for example <,> or Medchem <,> who make things <,> so-called industry <#> That 's quite a high proportion of <,> people airlines <,> often <,> except when they 're in the public employ <,> and they 're offering a service <#> Secondly <,> the Irish labour market is <.> con </.> characterised by long-term unemployment <,,> <#> Thirdly <,> it is <,> give or take <,> about forty-eight percent unionised <#> There 's a higher ratio <,> or a higher proportion of public service employees <,> are unionised than the private but <,> if we take the entire workforce we find something in the region of <,> five hundred thousand people <,> give or take <,> are in unions <#> And out of a workforce of one point three million <,> given that three hundred thousand are unemployed that translates loosely into a <,> about a fifty fifty figure <#> And finally <,> as us males are all <&> cough and unclear speech </&> aware <,> far more females <,> have decided to abandon the shackles of previous cultural prisons and have decided to work <,> at least in the overt workforce <,,> <#> So what might some implications be <#> Let 's begin with the <,> the female <,> for instance <#> What are the implications of more females in the workforce <#> If you were a human resource manager sitting at your desk <#> You 've seen the headline <,> guru Walsh says more females in workforce <#> And you say oh my God <,> what are the implications for <&French> moi </&French> <,,> <#> Ronan<S1B-011$B> <#> Uhm on a very practical aspect I suppose you <,> would have to hire more part-time staff if your female members become pregnant <#> And you have to give them your their legal statutory right isn't it three months off isn't it<S1B-011$A> <#> Fourteen weeks to be <{> <[> precise <#> Yes <,> there 's </[> one practical implication <#> In other words that someone could look at it and say <,> well females <,> some of them get pregnant <,> therefore I will need to replace them <,> they will be away for fourteen weeks plus holidays or whatever else therefore I need somebody to replace them in that time <#> That 's one approach yes <#> A second<S1B-011$B> <#> <[> Fourteen weeks aye <,> so </[> </{><S1B-011$C> <#> What about care facilities <,> you know <,><S1B-011$A> <#> Exactly <,> what about creche care <,> or other onsite facilities which <,> perhaps the female workforce rather than the male workforce <,> might look for <#> Don't know what the differences between that might be <,> but we can explore that off tape <,> okay <#> That 's second <#> Third<S1B-011$?> <#> <unclear> 7 sylls </unclear><S1B-011$A> <#> Why<S1B-011$?> <#> Because maybe <unclear> 10 sylls </unclear><S1B-011$A> <#> And why wouldn't the same flexi-approach apply to men with kids <,> <#> Speaking as one <,> <&> laughter </&> <#> I could do with it <#> <{> <[> Mm </[><S1B-011$C> <#> <[> Tradition </[> </{> <,> probably<S1B-011$A> <#> Tradition <,> that the female is the carer <#> But the tradition would say that the female stays at home <,> if she 's got the kid <,,> whereas the male goes to work <#> Why don't we instead make <,> have males and females come into work but let 's be more flexible about them <,,> <#> But yes it 's a good point taken from previous examples in literature <#> And finally the B Com 'd framed analyst says <,,> cos they 've been trained to think analytically and objectively <,,> it mightn't make any difference <#> Let 's just see <#> Let 's weigh up all these possibilities <#> Let 's consider the trends <#> And let 's take it from there <#> Because don't forget as <,> one part of your training suggests which stresses the objective and the analytical and the rational <,> nothing should surprise you <#> All females in the workforce <#> Hey <,> all males <#> Fifty fifty <#> Sixty forty <,> either way <,> you don't care <#> You 're a trained manager <#> You 'll do it no problem <#> Get out the case analysis <,> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> suggestions go through it <,> boom boom <,> report <,> manager 's desk <,> ten o'clock Wednesday morning <#> You 're in real trouble if someone asks you for <.> Wednes </.> or for Friday morning at ten o'clock cos you 're so used to putting them in on Wednesday at ten o'clock <#> Anyway <,,> <#> So that 's one set of implications <#> Number two <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> might be a set of implications concerning unionisation <,,> <#> Well Mr Walsh apart from the fact that as we 're trained rational managers there mightn't be any <,,> <#> By comparison with our competitor countries ie the United States we 've fifteen percent <.> unemp </.> or unionised <,,> <#> There may be <,> given the significant differences <,> something to take into account <#> In other words there may be somebody representing the workforce <,> in the worksite <,> that you 've to deal with <#> You as representative of management <,> they as representative of employees <#> And if you 've done collective bargaining type situations or if you 've negotiated with one person on behalf of a group then you 're aware of the situation <#> I saw Ciaran standing up here last week as some kind of class rep <,> correct or <,> no <,,> <#> Situation announcing him <,> a marketing type thing we 're aware of the class rep type of thing <#> What if the class rep becomes the shop steward <,> or whatever or the whatever in future <,> or is the the equivalent <#> So however there is some other managerial implications for unionisation <#> One is collective bargaining <,> ie that you don't negotiate with every individual in the workforce you <.> in </.> negotiate with one <,> on their behalf <#> Second <,,> third <,> and fourth <#> Good <,> you 'll think of something I presume by May <#> Long-term unemployment <,> is something we hear an awful lot about <#> What are the HR implications <,> that might arise from having a large number of people <,> who are long-term unemployed <,,><S1B-011$D> <#> They may become unemployable<S1B-011$A> <#> Exactly <#> There may be a certain set of skills out there that you can't do an awful lot with <,> and that however you 're put under pressure to do something about in your local area for instance if you 're a large employer <,> by TDs politicians governments and so on who say let 's go for jobs <#> Our aim in tourism this year I see <,> or for nineteen ninety-three ninety-four is thirty five thousand jobs <,,> <#> And then the idea is that the industry fails if it only gets thirty four thousand nine hundred and ninety nine <,> or something <#> Rather than starting off with saying <,> the industry really needs innovative products <,> say something that Manor House Hotel isn't producing for instance uhm <,,> <&> laughter </&> or <,,> a dynamic approach which <,> if it produces growth in the industry will lead to jobs <,,> maybe thirty five thousand <,> maybe seventy five thousand <,> who knows <,> and so on <#> And finally the fact that <,> almost six in ten of the workers <,> in this <,> Emerald Isle are in services rather than industry or in the public sector suggests that <,,> because traditionally services are characterised by <,,> rapid turnover <,,> lots of small operations <,> lots of part-time and contract work <,,> that <,,> a number of significant HR implications apply <#> Good so moving right along <#> Dineen nineteen eighty-seven <,> has suggested in his wisdom <,> that <,> what we 're seeing is <,> the rise of atypical unemployment patterns <#> The fundamental implication of these types of <,> general things that we 've talked about <,> such as services <.> unemploy </.> services unemployment unionisation and so on <,> female <,> an increase by female participation in the labour force <,> can be summarised <,> he says <,> in one thing <,> that all of this change is producing <,,> in terms of the labour <,> force <,> a set of atypical employment patterns <#> And he <,> mentions four <,,> <#> Firstly there 's been an increase in part-time employment <,,> <#> Secondly <,> a huge increase in temporary or casual work <,,> <#> Thirdly he can point to a rise in self employment <,,> <#> I think that was more true of the time he was writing <,> than it is today necessarily <#> And finally <,> in terms of being an explosion in government and community schemes <,> of one which great debate at the moment is whether to pay <,> double allowances to those on SES schemes on the north side versus the south side of the city <#> Are you aware of that debate on your local radio station <#> Yes <#> Yes <#> Yes they are <#> <&> laughter </&> They they told me to say <#> Okay <,> so let 's look at these <#> There 's been the criticism <,> Mr Walsh <,> that in fact <,> given macro changes to competitive <,> situation to the environment <,> given the single European market <,> given more macro things outside of the little island we live on <,> in fact <,> these are not atypical employment patterns any more <#> They may have been <,> even as lately as six years ago when Mr Dineen <,> excuse me Mr Dineen did his research <#> However in fact they are today <,> increasingly a dominant <,,> element <,> in the working landscape <,> and therefore a dominant <,> trend for HR specialists <,> managers generally and organisations to take account of <#> In other words that it is now perhaps <,> certainly among recent graduates <,> atypical <,> not to have a temporary <,> or contract position <#> In fact what would be <,> atypical would be to have a permanent job <#> Pensionable employment and so on <#> And I 've mentioned before Handy 's <,> suggestion that there are different forms of time now <#> Instead of looking at this in terms of the <,> uh the impact it 's having on the labour force he says let 's have <,> <.> le </.> let 's look at it on the impact it 's having on individuals <#> We all have different times to give to employers <,> full-time time <,> temporary-time <,> gift-time that we give to organisations voluntary societies and so on <,> and so on <#> And <.> tha </.> he looks at it in a very different way in his book The Age of Unreason <,> for those of you who want to look at that <#> So I think we would agree <,> yes <,> that these things are happening <#> We can all see around <,> we 've had the example in the Irish university system for instance <,> that a majority of teaching positions are now filled by contract staff <,> not by permanent people <#> That 's just one example <,> and we can probably think of members of our own families <,> or other friends who are in these types of situation <#> The question is <,> do we agree or not that these are atypical <#> Is it a cyclical thing that we 're going through <,> that these are <,,> somewhat dominant now <,> and once everything gets back together again we go back to the permanent long-term type of situation <,,> <#> Deborah<S1B-011$E> <#> Uhm we go back to the permanent uhm <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear><S1B-011$A> <#> Why<S1B-011$E> <#> Because uhm <unclear> 15 sylls </unclear><S1B-011$A> <#> Like basketball shoes <,,> fast food and so on <#> Alright so that 's that 's one interpretation <,> which I think is somewhat accurate <#> That there 's a trend out there that we 're copying or somewhat kind of five years behind or three years behind or whatever and <,> we just latch on <,,> <#> Anybody else with a comment <,,><S1B-011$F> <#> The companies as well <#> It 's a lot easier you know they don't have to worry about redundancy packages like that if <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear><S1B-011$A> <#> Yes<S1B-011$F> <#> And if your term contract is up like you know <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear><S1B-011$A> <#> You 're gone <#> Yeah <#> And the company from a cost point of view would be very interested in that obviously <#> But a company might also from a cost point of view be interested in renting accommodation rather than buying <,> uh leasing cars <,> you know they 're <,> if we take the Atlantic extension <,> there are a number of things we could do economically that would uh be more efficient <#> However <,> as we know the reason we try and lock in assets <,> fixed or human <,> is because of <,,> commitment <,> involvement <#> We don't get the same type of <,,> rapport with <,> temporary people as we might get with long-term <#> At least that 's one argument <#> But again that 's that 's a second valid point</I>
