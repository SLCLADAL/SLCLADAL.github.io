<S2B-050 Budget speech><I><S2B-050$A> <#> I am today making an additional net provision of eleven million pounds so as to achieve an average participation of thirty-eight thousand five hundred this year <,,> <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> <#> Ceann Comhairle <,> the Government 's policy agreement contains a commitment to payment of the legally-determined entitlements of married women to social welfare equality payments <#> We undertook that a <,> that a budget and a timescale for the payments would be set out having regard to budgetary constraints <,> and the costs involved <,> and that the process will be completed within four years <#> The judgement of the High Court in this matter was delivered last Friday the third of February <#> The judgement will require careful consideration by the Government <,> advised by the Attorney General giving the costs and the importance of the legal issues involved <#> While it has not been possible fully to complete that consideration I am including a provision of sixty million pounds as a first step this year <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> <#> As a first step this year <#> Should it prove necessary to spend more on these exceptional payments this year <&> cough </&> there are funding possibilities open to me through the disposal of State assets <,,> <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> <#> My budget target for the EBR would not then be increased by making further payments <#> And the assets I will consider disposing of are not in the commercial semi-state bodies <,,><&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><S2B-050$C> <#> Watch this space<S2B-050$D> <#> Read my lips<S2B-050$A> <#> Ceann Comhairle <,> the ceasefire of the thirty-first of August last has continued to underpin and deepen the Peace Process in this island of Ireland <#> The fear between neighbours North and South has been gradually reduced <#> To speed up this process <,> and in the interests of our neighbours <,> I propose to extend the free travel scheme to include pensioners in Northern Ireland undertaking cross-border journeys<S2B-050$X> <#> Hear-hear <&> applause </&><S2B-050$E> <#> Well done<S2B-050$A> <#> The existing free travel arrangements for pensioners in this part of the island will also be improved to put them on a similar basis <#> This means in effect <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><S2B-050$B> <#> Please <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><S2B-050$A> <#> <&Irish> A </&Irish> Leas-Cheann Comhairle<S2B-050$F> <unclear> several words </unclear><S2B-050$B> <#> We heard please<S2B-050$A> <#> <&Irish> A </&Irish> Leas-Cheann Comhairle this means <#> Nice one Michael but it wasn't <#> Nice one but it wasn't <,> <#> This means in effect that Doctor Ian Paisley can

Comhairle <,> beyond Ireland 's shores many parts of the world <,> many parts of the world are unfortunately enduring war <,> pestilence <,> and hunger <#> In the Third World <,> <&> cough </&> famine has become a plague in a world of plenty <#> Irish people have instinctively responded to this human tragedy <#> Many Irish organisations are actively involved <&> cough </&> on the ground in trying to alleviate this human plight <#> Our response is out of all proportion to our numbers <#> Perhaps it is because we still carry with us <&> cough </&> <,> as President Robinson said last Thursday <,> some memory for the horror of our Great Famine which began this spring one hundred and fifty years ago <#> I intend to mark that anniversary by providing tax relief at the standard rate on donations by individuals to designated Irish Third World charities<S2B-050$X> <#> Hear-hear <#> Well done<S2B-050$A> <#> Taxpayers will be able to mark to make their contributions in the range of two hundred to seven hundred and fifty pounds to the designated Third World charity of their choice <#> That body will receive the tax associated with the contribution from the Revenue Commissioners <#> This means that a donation of seven hundred and fifty pounds will be worth just over a thousand pounds to the charity concerned<S2B-050$X> <#> Hear-hear<S2B-050$A> <#> This new measure will for the first time allow people to exercise choice with regard to the agency to which they wish <,> to which they wish the State to contribute part of our official development assistance <#> We are committed in the programme for government to increase each year our ODA <#> This measure will help us to continue to do that as the tax component of the donations will form part of our ODA assistance <#> The tax component of the assistance <#> In addition I 'm introducing arrangements which for the future will enable time spent on voluntary work abroad for the agency for personnel service overseas by Irish public servants on a limited basis to be reckonable for pension purposes<S2B-050$X> <#> Hear-hear<S2B-050$A> <#> These measures will further strengthen the links of support and solidarity between this country and the Third World <&> cough </&> <#> Many of our county roads are in poor condition <#> The changing <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> the changing pattern the changing pattern of <.> adu </.> of use and the increased weight of agribusiness trucks have taken their toll on traditional roads which have poor foundations <#> The recent bad weather and flooding has aggravated this already difficult situation <#> As an immediate <,> as an immediate response I 'm providing eight million pounds extra this year which will bring the total exchequer allocation to over one hundred million for this purpose in ninety-five <,> <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> <#> In addition the Minister for the Environment as a matter of urgency will prepare a report for Government <{> <[> on </[> the situation <#> This report which will be completed within a matter of months will enable us to develop a coherent and integrated plan to bring our county roads up to an acceptable standard over the next ten years <#> The Government 's policy agreement contained a promise <,> contained a promise to continue with the initiative to reduce hospital waiting lists <#> I 'm providing eight million pounds for this purpose in nineteen ninety-five <#> The arts <,> the arts are playing an important role in developing our culture <,> promoting Ireland abroad <,> and providing employment at home <#> I am providing additional funding of two million pounds for the Arts Council <,,> <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> <#> <&Irish> A </&Irish> Leas-Cheann Comhairle it is important that we as a nation <,> it is important that we as a nation can collectively enjoy our rich cultural heritage <#> I therefore intend to introduce a special tack <.> rel </.> tax relief for donations to national collections of important heritage items including paintings <#> The details of this will be published in the Finance Bill <#> And I propose to provide additional funding of two point three million for tourism promotion <,> three point five million for preparatory work related to Ireland 's presidency of the European Union in nineteen ninety-six <,> and two point one million for certain sporting <,> cultural <,> and social projects details of which are set out in the principal features <#> The government have decided to phase out over two years fees for third level undergraduate students in publicly-funded colleges and to abolish fees for post-Leaving Certificate courses<S2B-050$B> <#> <[> Without interruption </[> </{><S2B-050$X> <#> Hear-hear <&> applause </&><S2B-050$A> <#> Details of this important change will be given today by my colleague the Minister for Education <#> In conjunction with this change I am extending the restrictions which currently apply to <.> par </.> to parent-child covenants to all covenants <#> This entails the application of a five percent income limit and the abolition of tax relief on covenanting on covenanting to minor children other than incapacitated children <#> These changes will apply to new covenants taken out on or after today and to existing covenants from the sixth of April next <#> In addition <,> from next year <,> when fees are abolished I will be abolishing tax relief on covenants generally <#> Tax relief will be retained for certain covenants including those for the elderly and incapacitated as set out in the principal features <#> The changes do not affect covenants for maintenance payments between separated spouses <#> Provision will be made for tax relief on fees paid to private colleges in respect of approved courses <#> This relief will be introduced for the academic year ninety-six ninety-seven <#> And it is also intended that maintenance grants under the higher education grant scheme will be extended to approved courses being followed by Irish students abroad with effect from ninety-six ninety-seven academic year <,,> <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> <#> <&Irish> A </&Irish> Leas-Cheann Comhairle I propose to make no changes in VAT rates or their coverage today <#> Existing arrangements will of course continue to be kept under review having regard to both domestic and European Union considerations <#> In the excise area I propose to seek an additional revenue contribution from a tax increase of twelve pence on a packet of twenty cigarettes <,> with pro rata increases on other tobacco products which will apply from midnight tonight <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> <#> This this this adjustment <,> this adjustment which will assist the financial and government priorities in other areas should not give rise to cross-border trade diversion or unduly to inflation <,> <#> Leas-Cheann Comhairle I intend to introduce a scheme which will give a vehicle registration tax relief of one thousand pounds where a car at least ten years old is scrapped and the owner purchases a new vehicle <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> <#> Schemes of this nature which can have environmental advantages have been employed with success in other countries <#> The proposed measure will be once-off running from the first of July ninety-five to the end of next year <#> It will apply in relation to those older cars which at the time of purchase of the new car have been continuously road-taxed and insured by the purchaser of the new car over the previous two year period <#> The cost <,,> <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> the cost of the various taxation and PRSI measures I have announced is a hundred and fifty-nine million pounds while expenditure additions total a hundred and forty-three million pounds <#> The budget targets already indicated take into account these costs and the effects on revenue buoyancy of the totality of the measures announced today <#> These targets reflect the commitment of this Government to be <.> pru </.> to the prudent budgetary strategy set out in the Government 's programme <#> Leas-Cheann Comhairle while I acknowledge that this year 's budget is benefiting from certain once-off factors the absence of which will generate pressures in future years <,> I want to confirm that the central direction of this budget will underpin the policy of this Government as set out in the Programme for Renewal over the next two years <#> We will need firm discipline and strict adherence to our commitments if we are to meet the targets which we have set for ourselves in the policy document <,> The Government of Renewal <#> I 'm therefore inviting people <,> inviting people to begin to plan for the future within the parameters which are contained in this budget as set out in the Government 's programme <#> The provision of certainty in a rapidly-changing world is one of the major positive components which a government can provide to a community which needs to plan and wants to invest <#> In this regard the existence of the social partnership and the framework for dialogue and consultation which it provides is an essential part of our way of doing business <#> The existence of the PCW <,> the National Development Plan <,> and the commitment of this Government to maintain its budget strategy <,> which I have outlined here today <,> provides a secure future within which I am inviting you the Irish people to plan and to invest <&> cough </&> <#> And I 'm now inviting you to do more <,> because planning for the next three years is not enough <#> We need to lift our eyes and focus upon the horizon of the near future which shall take us into the next century <#> The year twenty ten is only fifteen years away which may seem a long time looking forward but it is as close to us as nineteen eighty when you look back <#> And you all know how recent that year was and so you can all understand how near to us now is the near future of twenty ten <#> Our political <,> economic <,> and social energies must be co-ordinated together to focus upon a set of goals which we can aspire to and which we can also achieve <#> Nobody else is going to do this for us <#> As a sovereign people we must do it for ourselves <#> In fifteen years ' time I believe that Ireland should and can have the average per capita income of the European Union<S2B-050$X> <#> Hear-hear<S2B-050$A> <#> Provide full employment for all those seeking work <,> have the best preserved and the best managed environment of the European Union<S2B-050$X> <#> Hear-hear<S2B-050$A> <#> Possess the most efficient and effective public administration in Europe and be perceived outside Europe as the best place in which to invest and do business within Europe<S2B-050$X> <#> Hear-hear<S2B-050$A> <#> These goals <,> these goals which can only be achieved with leadership <,> teamwork <,> and imagination will if implemented transform our <.> live </.> transform our lives <{> <[> and the lives of all Irish </[> people who will come after us<S2B-050$B> <#> <[> Please let us hear the Minister </[> </{><S2B-050$X> <#> Hear-hear<S2B-050$A> <#> All of the components required to enable us to achieve these goals are within our own control <#> We are truly at last a sovereign people <#> What we need to do now <,> is to begin to exercise that sovereignty <#> I believe that the we we can build a society that admires success <,> rewards work <,> celebrates excellence and also promotes opportunity<S2B-050$X> <#> Hear-hear<S2B-050$A> <#> Demands equality and meets misfortune with compassion and with solidarity<S2B-050$X> <#> Hear-hear <#> Hear-hear</I>
