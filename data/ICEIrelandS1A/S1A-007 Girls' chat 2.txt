uh triplets<S1A-007$A> <#> I wonder how people have those multiple births and actually survive to tell the tale<S1A-007$B> <#> You couldn't I mean one <.> yo </.> person couldn't stay at home with all those children <#> Sure you couldn't <#> You couldn't with all the kids<S1A-007$F> <#> But then think about what it used to be like with your thirteen kids <{> <[> you know </[> and everybody

Apparently what happens is you keep sort of growing your nails you know so that 's like a <,> that 's a gel tip there <{1> <[1> <#> And then </[1> eventually what 'll happen is my nail will come up <{2> <[2> but </[2> they 'll keep putting gel on top of my <{3> <[3> nail </[3> so that keeps them strong and then you end up basically with your own set of nails but with a coat of gel over the top like a wee<S1A-007$F> <#> <[1> Right </[1> </{1><S1A-007$F> <#> <[2> Right </[2> </{2><S1A-007$F> <#> <[3> So that keeps them strong </[3> </{3><S1A-007$D> <#> Cos Saibh McAlister has them and I

about it the <{> <[> first few times so </[><S1A-007$A> <#> <[> And how <,> sorry how did you meet this guy or is he </[> <{> <#> Who is he <#> What 's his name <#> How did you meet him<S1A-007$B> <#> He 's a big brother of Mary and I 's friend from primary school <{> <[> <,> Glenda </[> MacNamara and he gave <,> apparently he 's been home for years but I 'd always thought he lived in London or Dublin or something<S1A-007$A> <#> <[> Oh really </[> </{><S1A-007$A> <#> Right okay<S1A-007$B> <#> And he 's been out in McSweeney 's and all the rest and I 've seen him loads <#> And uhm <,> we
