the best time to be going public and raising money as international stock markets have been somewhat depressed recently <#> Rory Gillen is an analyst with NCB Stockbrokers<S2B-016$G> <#> It 's always more difficult to raise finance in weak markets uhm but that said I mean DCC intends to raise only a small amount of money and uhm <.> de </.> you know despite the the bad uh conditions in the market we wouldn't anticipate any great difficulties in them doing that<S2B-016$F> <#> Now it has been suggested that there isn't much of an appetite for conglomerates in the market at present<S2B-016$G> <#> Uhm on balance that 's probably correct uh uhm but it 's more to do really with the problems experienced by some of the conglomerates in Ireland uhm through the recession <#> In particular both James Crean and Fitzwilton encountered difficulties <#> Uhm however DCC itself has managed itself uh very well during the recession uh through over the last few years uh and we would we would expect uhm you know that the uh track record will will will speak for itself<S2B-016$F> <#> But should DCC then be more focused ie should they be involved in less companies<S2B-016$H> <#> Probably uh over time <,> but <.> a </.> at the moment they are themselves developing uhm they are attempting to to streamline streamline the uh operating structure that they have in operation at the moment <#> Uhm they 're however still an unusual type of company <#> Uhm very few of the companies they have are wholly-owned subsidiaries <,> uhm they also have a number of associates and a number of investments <,> all <,> you know all of which together make up uh the DCC group<S2B-016$F> <#> Elan the pharmaceutical company based in Athlone has continued to report strong growth in profits <#> Last year <,> profits before tax increased by fifty-eight percent to thirty-five point six million pounds <#> Revenue was up nineteen percent at one hundred and seven million pounds <,> compared with ninety million the previous year <#> Earnings per share work out at one pound each <,> compared with sixty-seven pence last year <#> The largest increase in revenue came from royalty fees as the group 's new cardiac drug Cardizem CD is principally manufactured and marketed by another company Marion Merrill Dow <#> There was also an increase in revenue from licence fees from new distributors <#> But can these high profit figures be maintained <,> and how <#> Brian Crotty Vice President of Elan<S2B-016$H> <#> Uhm yes the the the revenues and net income has been growing uh over the past five to seven years uhm <.> p </.> due to the fact of the change of strategy to mind to market <#> Uh this is where Elan takes the product uh through all stages uh of the development and regulatory phases and then licence the product out <#> Uhm the growth from the the uh revenues over the past few years and going into the future is coming from our <.> ma </.> main products such as our once daily <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> uh and our nicotine patch <,> our <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> product <,> our uhm <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> product and the launch of these in additional countries <#> Today Elan 's products are sold in forty-four countries throughout the world<S2B-016$F> <#> Now there are fifty-five products under development at the moment <#> How many of these will reach the market uh soon and what sort of revenue could they expect to yield<S2B-016$H> <#> Well the the the uh the products under development at the moment some of them are are obviously sort of in the in the the the the long term and in the initial stages of development <#> Uhm some of them will actually reach the market over the next sort of twelve to eighteen months<S2B-016$F> <#> And uh what sort of <,> <.> a </.> <.> a </.> any examples of those<S2B-016$H> <#> Uh an example of those would be our uh Naproxen product uh our <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> product uh and uhm some antibiotic products that we 're working on<S2B-016$F> <#> Now uh <.> yo </.> also you say sort of like high growth can be maintained <,> however like pharmaceutical companies worldwide are facing threats from well certainly there there 's pressure from governments and uh generic uh <.> com </.> competitors <#> Uhm will you not be affected in the same way<S2B-016$H> <#> Well actually one of the the the benefits of the the type of of uh business that we 're in is that uh with drug delivery we 're actually providing uhm better therapeutic benefit uh for the patient so that in fact what we 're looking at is a more cost-effective type of treatment uhm because if you 've got a patient getting uh more out of their drug getting better absorption <,> by <.> get </.> by getting maintenance of the uh drug in the system <.> ov </.> <.> co </.> at complete levels over twenty-four hour periods uhm that patient is going to get better quicker uhm and therefore you 're going to have a reduced cost<S2B-016$F> <#> Glencar Explorations say
