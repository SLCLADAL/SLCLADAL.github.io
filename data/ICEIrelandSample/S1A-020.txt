</[><S1A-020$B> <#> <[> You paid to go to a formal with Obie </[> </{><&> laughter </&><S1A-020$C> <#> It 's just quite funny after you meeting her and everything in the gym and her being so bloody <.> r </.> rude<S1A-020$D> <#> Oh did you meet her <#> I didn't hear that part of it<S1A-020$A> <#> Well I met her in the gym <#> I met her a couple of times in the gym and she pretended she didn't see me <#> Then one day she did see <,> like she was literally walking past me and she had to say something <,> and she went hiya<S1A-020$B> <#> But <{> <[> she would 've </[> chatted away to you when you were a pupil wouldn't she<S1A-020$?> <#> <[> Like that 's </[> </{><S1A-020$A> <#> Sure I sat in the same office as her <#> We shared an office and got on <,> I mean we did get on <,> <{> <[> well </[><S1A-020$B> <#> <[> Aw she probably </[> </{> didn't recognise you<S1A-020$A> <#> Huh<S1A-020$B> <#> She probably didn't recognise you<S1A-020$A> <#> Are you being funny<S1A-020$B> <#> Yeah <#> Well I mean if you 're sitting in an office same office with someone for two years of course you 're going to recognise them <&> laughter </&><S1A-020$A> <#> Oh sorry <#> Right <#> I was going <,> do you do you think <#> Is it the hair <&> laughter </&><S1A-020$B> <#> That 's what people say you know when you haven't seen them <,> or you know oh I didn't recognise you there<S1A-020$A> <#> Mm <#> I don't really understand that one actually I must say uhm so<S1A-020$D> <#> I know because the irony being <,> I mean we 've all done it <#> You just think I just can't be assed <{1> <[1> talking to that </[1> person <#> But it takes more out of you to avoid them <{2> <[2> than </[2> it does to say <{3> <[3> hello what you doing </[3><S1A-020$A> <#> <[1> Yeah <#> Mm </[1> </{1><S1A-020$A> <#> <[2> Uh-huh </[2> </{2><S1A-020$C> <#> <[3> To actually find out </[3> </{3><S1A-020$B> <#> And keep walking<S1A-020$D> <#> Uh-huh <#> Exactly<S1A-020$A> <#> <{> <[> But Roisin thinks </[> I 'm really odd cos if I see people from school who I haven't seen in a while my immediate reaction is to duck into the nearest shop <#> I mean that 's just my reaction<S1A-020$?> <#> <[> <unclear> 5 syllables </unclear> </[> </{><S1A-020$D> <#> <{> <[> Well you see it 's hard cos </[><S1A-020$C> <#> <[> It depends on the person too </[> </{><S1A-020$D> <#> You see but it 's <.> v </.> I find it very hard because you 're like all <,> you invariably have to ask them so what are you <{> <[> at </[> or what are you up to <#> And then when they <.> s </.> ask you what are you up to <#> Oh I 'm a solicitor <#> I 've just bought a house blah-de-blah-de-blah they think then that you 've <.> a </.> asked this<S1A-020$A> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{><S1A-020$C> <#> <{> <[> To tell you <,> for you to tell them all about you </[><S1A-020$B> <#> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[> </{><S1A-020$D> <#> So I end up saying then like oh I 'm just working away in Belfast <#> So you end up getting nowhere with the conversation anyway cos you 're not telling anything <,> you 're not <{> <[> sharing anything <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> </[> <#> You 'll not get any back <,> you 're no further forward <#> So hello how are you doing and walk on<S1A-020$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-020$B> <#> Would you get a lot of that <#> As in like you 're the big girl who 's going to Belfast and has got a plan and career and all this kind of stuff<S1A-020$D> <#> Uhm <,> from people who don't uh know me <,> and <&> laughter </&> <#> But <,> but it 's actually quite funny because at when I was at that christening last Sunday and there was a <.> gi </.> uh Felice 's aunt used to teach in our school <,> and actually I 'm now realising that it 's not a bad thing you know <,> just well I <,> you know I work hard so I think <,> well I am sort of semi-successful so why should I be putting myself down going <,> do you know what I mean <#> But it<S1A-020$A> <#> <{> <[> It it it 's just it wouldn't occur </[> to the rest of us to even put in the <mention> semi </mention> <&> laughter </&><S1A-020$D> <#> <[> I end up </[> </{><S1A-020$B> <#> You are successful<S1A-020$D> <#> But I end up like over-compensating saying och I 'm just working away <#> Instead of saying yeah work 's going well or whatever <#> But yes <,> they would<S1A-020$B> <#> But you are always better to underplay it<S1A-020$D> <#> Yes <,> oh absolutely <#> But you know I do find that it 's all you know oh right and things are going really well and blah-de-blah <#> So <{> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[><S1A-020$A> <#> <[> And what </[> </{> do you find when you say you 're practice manager <#> Would you <,> <{> <[> would you </[> use that title<S1A-020$C> <#> <[> I don't </[> </{><S1A-020$C> <#> No <,> I don't<S1A-020$A> <#> No <#> <{> <[> What do you </[><S1A-020$C> <#> <[> People say </[> </{> <,> well people know that I 've been in a solicitors ' for so long now they <{> <[> just say </[> are you still in the solicitors ' <#> And I go yeah<S1A-020$?> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-020$A> <#> Oh right <#> Right<S1A-020$B> <#> So you 're actually not even given the chance to say how well you 've done really<S1A-020$C> <#> No there 'd be very few people who 'd know that I 'm<S1A-020$A> <#> Really <#> <{> <[> That 's a shame </[><S1A-020$B> <#> <[> Practice manager </[> </{><S1A-020$C> <#> Practice manager<S1A-020$B> <#> Practice manager of one of the biggest commercial law firms in Belfast <#> I mean that 's a job<S1A-020$C> <#> I 'd never say that to anybody<S1A-020$A> <#> I know <{> <[> well <,> I couldn't <,> </[> I couldn't imagine that you would <#> Being you <&> laughter </&><S1A-020$?> <#> <[> Well I just say <unclear> several syllables </unclear><S1A-020$C> <#> I just work for a solicitors '<S1A-020$A> <#> I know but sometimes it 's easier isn't it<S1A-020$D> <#> Well it is and then if they walk away feeling better that 's grand <#> Sure you know the craic yourself<S1A-020$C> <#> Have to admit it depends on the person <#> <{1> <[1> Like </[1> sometimes if you 've got a real <{2> <[2> pain in the arse </[2> who is bumming and blowing about what they 've done and all the rest of it you sort of go <,> well <{3> <[3> I </[3> can't stand you anyway so you know if if you ask me what I do I 'll say that I 'm a practice manager you know <#> <{4> <[4> It 's </[4> just being really bitchy in that sort of scene or being <{5> <[5> really </[5> not <{6> <[6> bitchy but <,> if they 're </[6> if they 're they 're sort of bumming and blowing and you never really got on with them anyway and they 're just really speaking to you because they can't get away from you or they have to<S1A-020$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-020$A> <#> <[2> Pain in the ass </[2> </{2><S1A-020$A> <#> <[3> Wait til you hear </[3> </{3><S1A-020$A> <#> <[4> Yeah </[4> </{4><S1A-020$A> <#> <[5> No it 's </[5> </{5><S1A-020$A> <#> <[6> No <#> It 's just protecting yourself </[6> </{6><S1A-020$A> <#> Yeah <#> Yeah<S1A-020$D> <#> Well there 's a barrister that was in my class at Queen 's <#> What the hell did you call him <#> Roger Mc <,> Roger McNamara was it<S1A-020$A> <#> I 'm not sure<S1A-020$D> <#> I can't remember <#> Anyway <,> nice enough fella <,> no social skills I don't think <#> He 's one of these very <,> just so <,> you know big would be coming <,> walking with his striped umbrella and oh Sarah <,> hi <#> Did you ever get into the Institute kind of look <&> laughter </&> <#> So I met him <#> Wait til you hear this right <#> I met him uhm in the High Court <#> And this can't be that long ago cos it was the time I was doing that absolutely pish <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> petition <#> It was the bane of my life<S1A-020$A> <#> Oh that one <#> Right<S1A-020$D> <#> Uhm <#> So <,> and that 's was what <#> That must have been either <,> it must have been just after Christmas I met him <#> And he said uhm <,> something about where are you working now <#> And I said oh I 'm working in <&> Chapman and Hall </&> blah-de-blah <#> And he would be one that I would say you know I 'm working for whoever <#> Thanks Sally-Anne <#> Uhm and he 's all oh yes so uh yes you were you know a couple of years behind the rest of us going to the Institute weren't you <#> And I said yes but I actually worked in a smaller firm and it was invaluable <.> pra </.> you know experience and actually it stood to me very well <#> Sure I always say things work out for a reason <#> I says so it worked out grand <#> So that was dead-on <#> Now I must make the point three or four weeks ago I was coming back from lunch you know up Queen Street so I was at those traffic lights opposite the Centra <,> and I saw him and I thought I can't be arsed talking to you <#> But he was waiting to cross the fucking lights as well <#> So I was standing with the mobile phone and all out <#> And I could see him like going <,> you know <,> looking like this just to make sure it was me <,> <#> Sarah <#> Och Roger how are you doing<S1A-020$C> <#> And you were coming across so sort of <,> you know <,> as if you weren't really <{> <[> trying to ignore </[> him<S1A-020$A> <#> <[> Genuine <,> yeah </[> </{><S1A-020$B> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> Hello <#> Uh I haven't just just been looking at you for the last ten minutes<S1A-020$D> <#> Now wait <#> This was a classic <#> How are things going Sarah <#> I said things are going very well Roger <#> What about yourself <#> He says oh I 'm just off to buy a leather jacket <#> Right <#> I said oh very good <#> Are you still at <&> Chapman and Hall </&> <#> I said I am <#> He says yes I think the last time I was speaking to you you were training <#> I said eight months ago <#> I said I 've now been qualified for three years and in fact actually I 've just been promoted <&> laughter </&> <#> I thought you bastard <{> <[> <#> You </[> know <,> real stuck up <#> So I mean I wouldn't be a bit behind the door in that sort of thing<S1A-020$A> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><S1A-020$B> <#> You should say something like are you still doing really low-quality bar work<S1A-020$D> <#> I said <{> <[> uh </[><S1A-020$A> <#> <[> Bastard </[> </{> <#> Exactly <#> What a git<S1A-020$D> <#> Well<S1A-020$B> <#> I mean <,> how stupid <#> You 'll never instruct him<S1A-020$A> <#> Yes <#> Well <{> <[> exactly </[><S1A-020$D> <#> <[> Precisely </[> </{> <,> <#> So then we were crossing the road at this stage and he says yes I 'm just going to buy <#> He must have been going to Diesel or somewhere to look at this leather jacket <#> He said I 've decided you know I may go get in with the fashion and uh <,> something about trendy anyway <#> I said listen Roger <,> it takes a hell of a lot more than a leather jacket to make somebody trendy<S1A-020$A> <#> <{> <[> Ooh </[><S1A-020$B> <#> <[> Ooh </[><S1A-020$C> <#> <[> Ooh </[> </{><&> laughter </&><S1A-020$D> <#> Now I 'm not <,> I wasn't <,> I was <{> <[> like <,> </[> it takes a hell of a lot more than a leather jacket but sure keep going and see how you get on<S1A-020$A> <#> <[> Claws out </[> </{></I>
