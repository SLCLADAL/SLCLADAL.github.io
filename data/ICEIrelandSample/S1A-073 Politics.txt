<S1A-073 Politics 1><I><S1A-073$A> <#> But uhm <,> the reality is <,> that it suited an awful lot of people cos as I said to you the other night there 's no way that the vast majority of Fianna Fa/il TDs could go back to their constituencies <,> and say that they were going to propose <,> uhm divorce or abortion or anything else like <#> They wouldn't get elected themselves <{1> <[1> next time <#> And so it suited </[1> but could Bertie <,> Bertie is in a personal dilemma <{2> <[2> <unclear> 2 words </unclear> </[2><S1A-073$B> <#> <[1> Though Bertie today went on record as supporting divorce </[1> </{1><S1A-073$B> <#> <[2> No he </[2> </{2> drew attention to that distinction<S1A-073$A> <#> Yeah <,> but the but the point is <{> <[> that </[><S1A-073$B> <#> <[> That Fianna </[> </{> Fa/il have decided to put <.> t </.> <.> su </.> to bring forward divorce legislation and support it<S1A-073$A> <#> But but nevertheless <,> there 's no guarantee they will be deliver able to deliver the country on that and <,> <{1> <[1> despite all their their their their </[1> their uhm <{2> <[2> lip </[2> service and everything <{3> <[3> one would still </[3> be <{4> <[4> careful </[4> <#> In order for them to carry divorce in the country they have to change the thing about <,> the Matrimonial Home Bill <{5> <[5> and they still haven't done that </[5><S1A-073$B> <#> <[1> Will you have another drop of wine Bronwyn <#> It 's there </[1> </{1><S1A-073$C> <#> <[2> Yes thanks </[2> </{2><S1A-073$B> <#> <[3> Nice isn't it </[3> </{3><S1A-073$C> <#> <[4> 'Tis yeah </[4> </{4><S1A-073$B> <#> <[5> And he said he said it </[5> </{5> that the uh yeah he said in great detail which interested me <#> I was surprised at <.> h </.> how detailed he was and how <,> informed he was in the sense that he had it so fresh in his mind <#> But he listed the way they approached the case <#> Quite different from the last time<S1A-073$A> <#> Mmm<S1A-073$B> <#> Because last time <,> they were not in favour <#> But it was because <,> there was an awful lot of things <,> that weren't attended to which were <,> cognate to it <#> But he listed about six things that they 've instituted <,> which a whole range of ministries <,> which uh have been designed <,> to structure the context and the parameters so that in fact the divorce legislation that was brought in wouldn't have the dire effects that some people feared<S1A-073$A> <#> Mmm<S1A-073$B> <#> And that this was still ongoing <,> and that a range of measures had been taken <,> and that having <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> that way <,> they were <.> m </.> moving ahead with the divorce legislation in a different <,> context where they had covered lots of problems<S1A-073$A> <#> But they haven't covered the matrimonial home thing <#> They thought they had <{1> <[> covered it <,> and the court case said </[1> and the courts said no <#> Now that is also one of the things where they suspect that the Attorney General 's office knew that that piece of legislation was defective <#> But it didn't suit Matt Russell that it should go through <,> so he didn't bother changing it <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> <#> That that it also said <,> on the other hand <,> uh shall we say there are more than one lawyer in the Government including Dick Spring <,> and if they were bloody good lawyers they too should have seen <{2> <[2> that as well </[2><S1A-073$B> <#> <[1> Mm <,> <unclear> 3 words </unclear> </[1> </{1><S1A-073$B> <#> <[2> Including Michael D Higgins </[2> </{2><S1A-073$A> <#> Absolutely <#> And they didn't see it so they can't blame your man for <{1> <[1> everything </[1> <#> I mean <.> i </.> <.> i </.> if they were doing their work uh they were doing their work these things wouldn't happen <#> But until such time as they do amend that <,> even organisations like AIM <,> the women 's organisations will be against divorce until such time <#> And they will advise their members to vote against <,> until such time as they bring that down <,> because <{2> <[2> <.> i </.> it 's quite dangerous </[2><S1A-073$B> <#> <[1> Oh no </[1> </{1><S1A-073$B> <#> <[2> And I think the the that the Government are </[2> </{2> trying to resolve that <#> I think it 's necessary to resolve it too I agree <#> Where I think they probably will <#> I don't <{> <[> think </[><S1A-073$A> <#> <[> But they but they if they </[> </{> bring the divorce in before they amend that it 'll fail again <,> and then it 'll be gone for a whole <{> <[> generation </[> not just ten or five years the next time<S1A-073$B> <#> <[> Mmm </[> </{><S1A-073$C> <#> When is it expected to come back up again<S1A-073$B> <#> Oh I didn't say that now<S1A-073$C> <#> <{> <[> <unclear> 4

uh I think very clear <#> Uh Bruton I thought was<S1A-073$A> <#> What did <{> <[> Bruton do </[><S1A-073$B> <#> <[> Magnificently </[> </{> revealing<S1A-073$A> <#> <{> <[> And how </[><S1A-073$C> <#> <[> Can I 've a biscuit </[> </{><S1A-073$A> <#> Oh please yes of course<S1A-073$C> <#> How do you mean he was revealing <#> What 'd did <{> <[> he do </[><S1A-073$B> <#> <[> On his </[> </{>

yeah yeah </[><S1A-073$B> <#> <[> Well he certainly isn't bright <,> but he 's not a </[> </{> good politician though<S1A-073$C> <#> He 's quite he 's a <{> <[> <unclear> 1 word </unclear> </[><S1A-073$B> <#> <[> Oh <,> he can </[> </{> put words together<S1A-073$C> <#> He can't<S1A-073$B> <#> He can <,> because <{> <[> he didn't take much </[><S1A-073$A> <#> <[> Oh God he didn't </[> </{> <#> He made a holy show <{> <[> of himself the other day </[><S1A-073$B> <#> <[> He can speak much <,> he can speak much better </[> </{> than most of them better than Bertie Ahern but anyway<S1A-073$C> <#> Can he<S1A-073$B> <#> Oh he can <#> Sure Bertie Ahern can't speak neither Irish nor English <&> laughter </&> <#> He can only speak in Dublin<S1A-073$C> <#> Excuse me now you <{> <[> watch out now <,> you you bogger you you bogger </[><S1A-073$B> <#> <[> It wasn't me <#> That 's all <#> <unclear> 5 words </unclear> </[> </{> <&> laughter </&><S1A-073$C> <#> Would you

drinks </[> <#> It 's a dreadful pub actually now <#> It was a nice pub at one time<S1A-073$C> <#> <[> Exactly yeah </[> </{><S1A-073$C> <#> Oh you 're shocking <#> Where was Bruton from<S1A-073$A> <#> Meath<S1A-073$B> <#> Meath<S1A-073$C> <#> Oh Meath right<S1A-073$B> <#> And he shows it too <&> laughter </&> <#> But uhm<S1A-073$C> <#> What did he do today in his review<S1A-073$B> <#> What <#> He was being interviewed <,> and he kept on and kept on saying <,> we can have no discussions with Labour <,> of any kind <,> until <,> they have declared a position on the principle <,> of would they <,> do business with a Government whose ministers <,> did not were were were collaborators et-cetera<S1A-073$A> <#> Mmm<S1A-073$B> <#> In the Taoiseach 's <,> deception of the Da/il <#> And he kept on repeating it <,> that there was no <,> no way around this and all that <,> which of course is<S1A-073$C> <#> And what 's he trying to do <#> Basically just <{> <[> highlight </[><S1A-073$B> <#> <[> He he he was </[> </{> he was trying to <{> <[> <.> ob </.> </[><S1A-073$A> <#> <[> Drive </[> </{> a wedge between Fianna Fa/il and <{> <[> Labour </[><S1A-073$B> <#> <[> Of course yeah </[> </{> <#> But he was also <,> doing as the interviewer said to him look he says I mean he says the interviewer says to him <,> eventually and rightly so <#> He says what you 're really saying is <,> that Dick Spring has to declare <,> that <,> he 'll be doing no business with Fianna Fa/il <,> before you 'll talk to him <,> and accordingly <,> if you like if he 's going to stay in Government he has to <,> kow-tow to you<S1A-073$A> <#> Mm mm mm mm<S1A-073$C> <#> Yeah<S1A-073$B> <#> In other words you 're expecting him to burn his boats and his bridges <,> <{> <[> and you 're </[> laying down what the <.> la </.> what what the <.> lad </.> what the Labour party thinking should be <,> before you will deign to talk to them <#> And of course the interviewer was quite right <#> But it means is that Bruton now can't <,> he 's ruled himself out because there 's no question of that <unclear> 1 word </unclear><S1A-073$A> <#> <[> Mm mm mm </[> </{><S1A-073$C> <#> Well to be <.> hones </.> I wouldn't think I wouldn't think Dick 'd be going for <,> uh an alliance with Fine Gael and Bruton <{1> <[1> even though Dick might see himself then say in the </[1> Taoiseach 's position <,> if Bruton was the other <,> <{2> <[2> the person </[2><S1A-073$B> <#> <[1> But he <,> but Bruton </[1> </{1><S1A-073$A> <#> <[2> He wouldn't </[2> </{2> want to give it to him<S1A-073$C> <#> But I I wouldn't think Dick 'd like Bruton as Taoiseach<S1A-073$B> <#> No<S1A-073$A> <#> But Bruton <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear><S1A-073$B> <#> But even if and one gets the impression that Fine Gael are anxious to get back into government <,> by this high-minded drawing a line in the sand et-cetera <,> there will be no talking <,> because the principles have got to be <{1> <[1> declared </[1> <#> And he kept on repeating this stuff <#> It really means that he 's shutting himself out from real debate <,> because of course you 've got <{2> <[2> to get around these things </[2><S1A-073$A> <#> <[1> Mm mm </[1> </{1><S1A-073$A> <#> <[2> That 's right yeah that 's right </[2> </{2><S1A-073$B> <#> Bertie was away streets ahead <,> which he is <,> as well as uhm <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <.> we </.> we 're saying quite clearly <,> we accept we made a mistake <#> We 're not trying to back out of that <#> What we are asserting is that we <,> didn't realise the significance of the information <,> we hadn't time to assess it <,> and we did not intentionally <,> uh try to deceive Labour or the Da/il <#> But we know now that we have made a mistake in that matter <,> and we say it 's up to Dick Spring to either to accept <,> our veracity on that <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> and we 're just telling him the situation as it is in all honesty <{> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[> <#> But at least <,> he was handling this thing in a way that real politics has to work<S1A-073$A> <#> <[> Mmm yeah </[> </{><S1A-073$C> <#> He wasn't holier than thou like Bruton has come across as <&> laughter </&><S1A-073$B> <#> Sure Dick Spring in the position he 's in at the moment would be nuts <,> to say to John Bruton oh dear John <,> thank-you <,> <&> laughter </&> <#> I want to assure you I I 'll have nothing to do with those other <{> <[> people </[><S1A-073$A> <#> <[> Now let 's talk </[> </{> and the other guy saying you 're only getting two Ministers <&> laughter </&> <#> Having the other <,> having Dick <,> burning his boats<S1A-073$B> <#> Oh I 'd say within Fine Gael there 'll be a row about that<S1A-073$A> <#> Mmm<S1A-073$B> <#> Cos essentially they 're out in the cold<S1A-073$C> <#> But they have no real real <,> <{> <[> charismatic leader </[><S1A-073$B> <#> <[> Well if they wanted to be out in the cold it might be a good strategy </[> </{> <,> but I don't think they do want to be out in the cold<S1A-073$A> <#> Mm<S1A-073$C> <#> They 're out in the cold a long time<S1A-073$B> <#> That 's where they 'll be too <#> Cos if Labour and Fianna Fa/il can get together satisfactorily <,> and try to get proper structures into place <,> they 've money to deliver cos things are on a high in lots of ways<S1A-073$C> <#> Mm<S1A-073$B> <#> They 've nothing to do but gain <#> Tommy McEllistrim put it that way today when he was asked<S1A-073$A> <#> Did he <.> wa </.> <#> How interesting he was asked<S1A-073$B> <#> Mm hmm <#> They were taking Kerry as <.> ki <.> as a kind of a sounding board as a constituency some of them<S1A-073$A> <#> Oh<S1A-073$B> <#> But so uh and Noel Brasil was kind of saying he wouldn't mind if Fianna Fa/il went into opposition soon <,> <#> McEllistrim said that was a different head altogether<S1A-073$A> <#> I think Smith is probably on his last term anyway<S1A-073$B> <#> That uhm <,> it would be very <,> unwise of Bertie <,> in his view to <,> leave office at this time if a satisfactory arrangements can be made <#> It 's a good Government and they 're going ahead with a clear programme so <,> <.> par </.> particularly when <,> we negotiated the structural funds <#> There 's six billion pounds there over the next few years <#> <{> <[> Why should we give it <,> why </[> should we give it to another crowd to distribute <&> laughter </&> <#> It 's such a <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <#> It 's typical<S1A-073$C> <#> <[> It 's a good time to be there yeah </[> </{><S1A-073$B> <#> It 's absolutely typical because there 's another way of looking at it and that is that if Fianna Fa/il ever wanted another chance at all <,> of getting themselves in order and coming up with a defined definite policy for Fianna Fa/il and <,> long-term of ever hoping to be the sole Government as a party <{> <[> again </[> <,> they should go into opposition<S1A-073$A> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><S1A-073$A> <#> Maybe<S1A-073$B> <#> And I don't happen to think that Bertie is a national leader <#> Now maybe I hope I 'm wrong <,> but I don't think that he 'll bring the country with him <#> I think he may be a Dublin guy but he hasn't got what Charlie Haughey had at all<S1A-073$C> <#> Well I don't think many of them <{> <[> do to </[> be honest<S1A-073$A> <#> <[> Mmm </[> </{><S1A-073$C> <#> Do you would you like some tea<S1A-073$A> <#> Yes please yeah <{> <[> <#> I think it 's made actually <#> Yes please </[> if you would<S1A-073$C> <#> <[> Will I pour out your water </[> </{><S1A-073$C> <#> Will you hand me your cup<S1A-073$B> <#> I don't believe that old Robert Doherty is on anymore anyways<S1A-073$A> <#> You you you 're probably right in this in the present circumstances <#> And if he 's a real problem I mean uh all of them despite themselves have to look at where they 're at and will they be back the next time and things like that <#> But some of them are coming to the end of their <,> their sell-by date and things like that <#> And there 's the fact that they want to hold on and who can blame them as individuals <#> But when you 're not involved it 's easy to look at the good of the party <#> And I mean I 'm not involved in that way <#> And I would I would actually think that from the party <,> objectively speaking from the party 's point of view <,> they could <,> do with a spell if not two in opposition<S1A-073$B> <#> But Fianna Fa/il have never seen it like <{> <[> that never </[><S1A-073$A> <#> <[> No </[> </{> I know that <{> <[> <#> No I know that </[><S1A-073$C> <#> <[> But sure </[> </{> no party likes to be in opposition anyway<S1A-073$B> <#> Fianna Fa/il particularly<S1A-073$A> <#> But then they have been in government so often<S1A-073$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-073$A> <#> Fine Gael were the ones that were constantly in opposition and they did nicely out of it too <#> But then they lost their heads when they went ahead and did stupid things like appointing their friends and their relatives and my God they 'd loaded the judiciary with people <,> friends you know <#> And the day they were leaving office they filled appointments <#> Indeedin the day he was leaving office Michael D did precisely that<S1A-073$B> <#> Michael D was only in the office the first term<S1A-073$A> <#> I know but the he the day he thought that the Government was dissolved before that morning <,> he appointed people on to boards<S1A-073$B> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> Well I don't know why I was left out from a

<#> Thank-you<S1A-073$A> <#> Well I 'll tell you Bronwyn it 's against my principles to go to a pub on a Sunday night <,> but by God I 'm going tonight to hear what they all have to say<S1A-073$C>
