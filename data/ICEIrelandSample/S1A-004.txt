</{1><S1A-004$B> <#> <[2> Well the whole thing about it is </[2> </{2> that all their family 's over here and they don't want their children to grow up <{> <[> not knowing who their family is </[><S1A-004$A> <#> <[> Oh no well they 'll never </[> </{> <,> that is perfectly true<S1A-004$B> <#> Yes<S1A-004$A> <#> But I thought the time that we 're living in and especially with this Iraq war <#> And Cordelia says <,> well I said to them do you not think <,> and I Madeleine says <,> och mummy no <#> We like to come home for a few days<S1A-004$C> <#> Well sure Lauren <,> I travelled on an air flight from Newark to <,> through Shannon to Dublin <{1> <[1> about </[1> two years ago <,> and there was a girl across the flight from me <#> Fortunately I was on the outside aisle that there was only two seats <{2> <[2> in </[2> <#> But she was on the<S1A-004$A> <#> <[1> Aye </[1> </{1><S1A-004$A> <#> <[2> Yes </[2> </{2><S1A-004$A> <#> On the other <{> <[> aisle </[><S1A-004$C> <#> <[> In the middle aisle </[> </{> you know where there 's about <{> <[> five or six </[> seats <#> Well saying that <,> the hostess was very kind and <,> God love her the hostess earned her living that day jumping up and down<S1A-004$A> <#> <[> Yes five seats </[> </{><S1A-004$A> <#> Aye<S1A-004$C> <#> But those children never<S1A-004$A> <#> Oh was she travelling <{> <[> with children </[><S1A-004$C> <#> <[> She was </[> </{> travelling with two <{> <[> children </[> <#> And we didn't leave America til nine o'clock that night <,> so we were travelling through the night and the children were all <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1A-004$A> <#> <[> Children </[> </{><S1A-004$A> <#> <{> <[> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[><S1A-004$A> <#> <[> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[> </{><S1A-004$B> <#> Did they not sleep<S1A-004$C> <#> No Pauline they didn't<S1A-004$A> <#> And God I I <.> a </.> I agree with <{> <[> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[><S1A-004$C> <#> <[> And she was a girl </[> </{> <,> the girl got off at Shannon <#> She wasn't <{1> <[1> continuing on to Dublin </[1> <#> Pauline she was weary <,> <{2> <[2> even getting </[2><S1A-004$A> <#> <[1> Aye aye </[1> </{1><S1A-004$A> <#> <[2> I was saying to uh </[2> </{2> I said to Cordelia <,> what in the name of God this is a new thing flying in by Shannon <#> Well apparently it was the only flight they could get <#> And then they 'd <{1> <[1> to take a flight from Shannon to Dublin </[1> and this is her idea <{2> <[2> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[2><S1A-004$B> <#> <[1> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Shannon to Dublin </[1> </{1><S1A-004$C> <#> <[2> Well generally Lauren </[2> </{2> <,> the flight that I come on <,> uh when I left America <{1> <[1> I </[1> wasn't to get off at Shannon <#> <{2> <[2> The </[2> people that were getting <{3> <[3> off at </[3> Shannon would get off and we would <{4> <[4> sit on </[4><S1A-004$A> <#> <[1> Aye </[1> </{1><S1A-004$A> <#> <[2> Aye </[2> </{2><S1A-004$A> <#> <[3> Off </[3> </{3><S1A-004$A> <#> <[4> Yeah </[4> </{4> sit on<S1A-004$C> <#> But when I was going out to the States <,> <{1> <[1> I </[1> went down to Dublin and I got on in Dublin but yes I had to get off <,> in Shannon and wait for an hour until <{2> <[2> the flight you know </[2> <#> But there coming across <,> I wasn't <{3> <[3> off </[3> the flight at all<S1A-004$A> <#> <[1> Uh-huh </[1> </{1><S1A-004$A> <#> <[2> Oh Lord right <#> Yes </[2> </{2><S1A-004$A> <#> <[3> Aye </[3> </{3><S1A-004$A> <#> Well do you know that one time we had a <.> ta </.> a table quiz up here <,> go back about five years <#> And Gemma won the first prize and it was Aer Lingus giving a flight from Belfast to Shannon <#> Now I remember Beezer God rest him <,> when I came in I said about Gemma winning and Beezer says <,> God that was great <#> I said <,> to tell you the truth I said <,> I can never see her using it <#> So it was valid up to about six months <#> So I said to her one day I said uhm <,> when are you going to use that <#> She says <,> I don't know <#> I said <,> if I 'd 've been near you that night I would 've said <,> don't take that first prize <#> Go down the line and get something else <#> But anyway she says <,> I know what I 'll do with it but she never said <#> She went up to Father McBurney <,> his sister 's living in Ennis in County <{1> <[1> Clare </[1> and she says Father <,> there 's a belated birthday present <#> And he said what <&> laughter </&> <#> He said oh Gemma he says <,> I 'll pay you for those <#> No she says no problem you know <#> And do you know <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> afterwards <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> He said <,> I got on at International and I sat and I thought to myself <,> enjoy all this for this is free <#> Aer Lingus <,> and he said <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> he sat back and read from <{2> <[2> Belfast to Shannon </[2><S1A-004$B> <#> <[1> Oh good </[1> </{1><S1A-004$B> <#> <[2> And he hadn't <,> </[2> </{2> he hadn't the bother of <{> <[> driving or </[><S1A-004$A> <#> <[> Correct </[> </{> <#> And he came back that way <#> It was a return <#> Uh he appreciated it <#> But I couldn't get over these ones but <{> <[> then I forgot that they give </[> <,> they can go to Shannon and then they can sit almost probably I don't know <#> But you know Aer Lingus is doing very badly<S1A-004$B> <#> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[> </{><S1A-004$B> <#> Mhm<S1A-004$A> <#> See where they 're taking the shamrock off the <{> <[> tail and <.> every </.> <#> I think </[> that 's <,> I think that 's awfully sad to see that<S1A-004$B> <#> <[> Yes <#> Seen that </[> </{><S1A-004$B> <#> Uh-huh<S1A-004$A> <#> Do you not<S1A-004$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-004$A> <#> But I mean it 's a State airline and I think it 's an awful shame <{> <[> why they have to </[><S1A-004$B> <#> <[> And why are </[> </{> they changing<S1A-004$A> <#> I don't know to be honest with you <#> You see Ryanair is sweeping them off their feet <#> And Value and all the rest of it <#> Now finishing <{> <[> all that <#> Tell me </[> about our Anne <#> Don't worry about our Anne <,> we 'll be examining her later <#> Anne O'Connell<S1A-004$C> <#> <[> Too much competition going on </[> </{><S1A-004$B> <#> Well uhm <,> we went over to see <{1> <[1> her </[1> <#> She can't really join in the conversation <#> But it 's grand to have two or three people that you can talk with and <{2> <[2> she </[2><S1A-004$A> <#> <[1> Aren't youse awful good </[1> </{1><S1A-004$A> <#> <[2> Pauline </[2> </{2> you need it <{> <[> and </[> <#> When you 're visiting anyone sick you need a second or a third one to let the conversation flow<S1A-004$B> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><S1A-004$B> <#> You 're not <{1> <[1> <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> </[1> in any awkward <{2> <[2> silence </[2> <#> You see if you went up on your own to <.> t </.> and talked to Anne <,> Anne tries to answer you <{3> <[3> <,> <#> You </[3> can't make out what she 's saying <,> <#> You 're <{4> <[4> <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> </[4><S1A-004$A> <#> <[1> No </[1> </{1><S1A-004$A> <#> <[2> Aye </[2> </{2><S1A-004$A> <#> <[3> I couldn't </[3> </{3><S1A-004$A> <#> <[4> Margaret </[4> </{4> O'Dowd has done it<S1A-004$B> <#> She 's frustrated because she can't make herself <{1> <[1> understood </[1> <#> It doesn't work out <{2> <[2> too well </[2><S1A-004$A> <#> <[1> Yes </[1> </{1><S1A-004$A> <#> <[2> No it 's not </[2> </{2> fair to anybody <#> But is she <,> I wonder is she still in the same room<S1A-004$B> <#> She is<S1A-004$A> <#> It 's a place I don't like<S1A-004$B> <#> Well now Anita Martin told me there a week ago that they she and Terry were over visiting <{> <[> and </[> the nurse came til her and told her that they had found Anne <#> You know she 's in a room on her own<S1A-004$A> <#> <[> Aye </[> </{><S1A-004$A> <#> Yes <#> <{> <[> She 's got the Zimmer in front of her </[><S1A-004$B> <#> <[> And they wouldn't be in <,> </[> </{> they wouldn't be in and out all that<S1A-004$A> <#> No<S1A-004$B> <#> She 'd got along the corridor on the Zimmer and was standing at the outside door <#> And they were afraid that she was going to speed off like <#> So I think from that Enda has arranged these classes <#> Uh she was over for aromatherapy class <{1> <[1> in Beech Hall on the Andersonstown </[1> Road they had the uh Bobby Duffy 's <{2> <[2> centre </[2> <#> Bobby knows Anne and he 's very fond of her<S1A-004$A> <#> <[1> Yes <,> <#> Andersonstown </[1> </[1><S1A-004$A> <#> <[2> Yes </[2> </[2><S1A-004$A> <#> Excuse me that was in <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> 's house <#> The day that they bought that house that evening I was up in <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1A-004$B> <#> Is that right <#> Well do you know I was at school with one of them two of them <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> <#> Mabel <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> and then Anita <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> <{1> Anita <[1> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[1> was Head Girl the year I went to Balmoral <{2> <[2> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[2> <#> And Mabel was younger than me <#> <{3> <[3> And Mabel married <.> Do </.> uh <,> </[3> Doctor Sheehy<S1A-004$A> <#> <[1> I remember their names <#> Anita used to </[1> </{1><S1A-004$A> <#> <[2> Aye </[2> </{2><S1A-004$A> <#> <[3> Aye <#> It 's a beautiful house </[3> </{3><S1A-004$A> <#> That 's right<S1A-004$B> <#> She was his <.> fir </.> she was his first wife<S1A-004$A> <#> That 's <{> <[> right </[><S1A-004$B> <#> <[> She </[> </{> died when they were quite young<S1A-004$C> <#> And is Doctor Sheehy married secondly then<S1A-004$B> <#> Oh he is<S1A-004$A> <#> He is <#> I remember well <#> But <,> even to get her to those classes like it 's a very good thing too but it 's sad to see her truthfully and honestly <#> I 've only been over the once because I 've no <{> <[> transport </[><S1A-004$C> <#> <[> Well Lauren </[> </{> <,> I haven't saw Anne O'Connell in about two and a half years <#> <{1> <[1> Last </[1> time I ever saw her it was in the Royal in the <{2> <[2> caring </[2> for the elderly<S1A-004$A> <#> <[1> Aye </[1> </{1><S1A-004$A> <#> <[2> Aye </[2> </{2><S1A-004$A> <#> Aye<S1A-004$C> <#> And today I could <,> meet no-one and tell them I thought she looked wonderful<S1A-004$B> <#> Oh I don't<S1A-004$A> <#> You see I I would agree with <{> <[> you even when I was there </[><S1A-004$C> <#> <[> Because </[> </{> the girl had no interest<S1A-004$A> <#> No<S1A-004$C> <#> I didn't think she could follow <#> There was another young girl that was her godchild <{> <[> there </[><S1A-004$B> <#> <[> Rachel </[> </{> was there <#> <{> <[> Marie 's daughter Rachel <,> but saying </[><S1A-004$A> <#> <[> Yes <#> The day we were there <,> Rachel </[> </{><S1A-004$B> <#> She loves Rachel<S1A-004$C> <#> Saying that <,> Anne wouldn't be enthusing about anybody visiting her <#> That would be my opinion because I don't think she had <{> <[> any interest </[><S1A-004$A> <#> <[> Excuse me </[> </{> <#> I agree with you <#> That 's what <,> that 's what I thought when I came out <#> And I said to Margaret O'Dowd <,> I said <,> Margaret <,> we were there <,> making conversation and the door opens and these three young ones came in <#> And do you know something it was a joy to see them coming <#> I thought for young ones it was lovely of them <#> <{1> <[1> And then </[1> Margaret O'Dowd <,> that Rachel one was one of them <,> and two other lassies <#> And I said to them <,> you 're very good coming over <#> I looked at her and I said <,> I just said you know Anne Anne Anne has been very good to you <#> <{2> <[2> But I said it still is lovely to see </[2> <#> Yes I said I think it 's lovely to see it<S1A-004$B> <#> <[1> Who was it </[1> </{1><S1A-004$B> <#> <[2> She was <#> She 's her grandmother </[2> </{2><S1A-004$B> <#> She brought her everywhere with her when she was a child<S1A-004$A> <#> Yes <#> But Anne is <,> and like God help her <,> like we said to her was she happy <,> you know <,> what about the food <{> <[> <#> She goes </[><S1A-004$B> <#> <[> The whole thing about it is </[> </{> <,> she wouldn't be happy anywhere <#> Like she she 's not really uh <,> she <.> cou </.> she couldn't be happy anywhere in the state she 's in<S1A-004$A> <#> I know like God help her <#> No Lauren <,> I think it 's a pity <#> I think Nazareth <,> <#> I think Nazareth is the answer <{> <[> for her </[><S1A-004$B> <#> <[> Sure </[> </{> Nazareth won't take her<S1A-004$A> <#> Sure I know they won't <#> But that 's that 's the type of place <#> But do you know where we went one Sunday afternoon <#> One Sunday evening <,> only that we were in a hurry home <,> you were going to get your front door knocked in <,> Pam Dwyer brought us up <,> she 's a friend of a <,> the Saint John of God place <,> up the Upper Springfield Road<S1A-004$B> <#> Aye but sure they don't have nursing care in it<S1A-004$A> <#> No they don't <#> That 's the unfortunate thing <#> <{> <[> There are rooms I </[><S1A-004$B> <#> <[> Beechmount 's the only </[> </{> one <,> the only place that has all three <{1> <[1> uh sections </[1> <,> residential care <,> nursing home <{2> <[2> and EMI which is </[2> elderly <,> uh <{3> <[3> mentally infirm </[3><S1A-004$A> <#> <[1> I would say <,> yes </[1> </{1><S1A-004$A> <#> <[2> Aye <,> yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-004$A> <#> <[3> Mental infirm </[3> </{3> <#> Now <,> she brought us up there<S1A-004$B> <#> You never <,> once you go into Beechmount <,> no matter what happens you <,> you never have to move<S1A-004$A> <#> You see that 's the thing <#> That 's the answer <#> But <,> for anybody that would be able to look after themselves that Saint John of God this place is just <,> it 's over a hundred pounds cheaper than Nazareth <#> And the rooms are ensuite <#> And next to their wardrobe you open you think it 's a second wardrobe and when you open it <,> their hand basin <,> their cooker <,> their oven and their microwave<S1A-004$C> <#> <{> <[> Self-contained </[><S1A-004$B> <#> <[> So they have to cook for themselves </[> </{><S1A-004$A> <#> That 's because yes <,> that 's what I 'm saying if you 're able to <#> Now I <{> <[> don't know </[><S1A-004$B> <#> <[> So it 's </[> </{> something like <,> it 's not even the same as <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> you know cos they 've no cooking facilities <#> They only can make a cup of tea for themselves<S1A-004$A> <#> And Lauren if you saw this place <#> Honest to God it is beautiful<S1A-004$C> <#> But then the <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> Lauren 's about ten years old <#> This has only been opened within the last year</I>
