fortnight <#> The twentieth <,> a month<S1A-074$B> <#> This day five weeks is Christmas day <#> We 'll have our Christmas dinner over<S1A-074$C> <#> How many shopping days<S1A-074$A> <#> God<S1A-074$C> <#> Did you see they were transporting Santa from Switzers to Brown Thomas the other day in town <,> and all everyone was stopped <#> They got this crane right <,> and it was kind of like Santa arriving in Brown Thomas <#> Because now you 're never gonna guess Dad <,> Switzer 's window is no more<S1A-074$B> <#> Oh<S1A-074$C> <#> Ah it 's it 's horrible<S1A-074$A> <#> Switzer 's window isn't any more<S1A-074$C> <#> No because you know they were renovating it or they were redoing it and they can't do the windows <#> So what they 've done is they have kind of a makeshift one in Brown Thomas windows but it 's crap<S1A-074$A> <#> Mmm<S1A-074$C> <#> And it 's terrible <#> It 's awful because <{1> <[1> every year we 've always been awful </[1> <,> <#> So anyway <{2> <[2> they were </[2> Santa was arriving in Brown Thomas the other <{3> <[3> day </[3><S1A-074$B> <#> <[1> <unclear> 4 words </unclear> </[1> </{1><S1A-074$A> <#> <[2> Who was this now </[2> </{2><S1A-074$A> <#> <[3> You mean the </[3> </{3> real Santa<S1A-074$C> <#> Yeah he was arriving yeah <#> And uhm they got this crane yoke and he he was transported from uhm Switzer 's over to Brown Thomas in the air<S1A-074$A> <#> In the in the lifted <{> <[> up and </[> all the kids could see could they<S1A-074$C> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-074$C> <#> Yeah <,> he was arriving <#> Forget the reindeers <#> A crane will do nicely<S1A-074$A> <#> Mmm <#> Well I remember a being uh Paddy saying to me one time oh years ago <#> I was there was a time I think I was saying to her about uhm being out in Baldonnel looking for apples <,> and eh the way you I only had the two of you at the time <#> And one of you said to me Edel probably said to me something about uhm how do apples get on trees<S1A-074$B> <#> How do what<S1A-074$A> <#> How do apples get on trees <#> And I said well God puts them there <#> And she said to me and who 's God <#> And I I <,> I was aghast you see at <unclear> several sylls </unclear> shortly afterwards I mean<S1A-074$B> <#> They might say the same now if you asked them <{> <[> but go on <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[><S1A-074$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> shortly afterwards <{1> <[1> Ciara and that were here </[1> <,> shortly afterwards Ciara and those were here for dinner one night and I was saying this to Ciara and she says but why were you puzzled <#> For God 's sake I said you 'd think that after being in school for a year she 'd have heard of God even if she didn't hear it at home <#> She says Maggie she says you 're so old-fashioned <#> She says we don't teach about God in school <#> We talk about <{2> <[2> baby Jesus in school </[2> <#> So fair enough <#> And then she went on from that and it must 've been in the Autumn <#> Later on we were talking about Santa and that <,> and I was saying about Santa coming down the chimney <#> And she says gee she says but you 're so old-fashioned <#> She said we have no chimneys in our house <#> They hadn't in this scheme <#> She says all the children in this scheme know <,> that Santa comes by spaceship <&> laughter </&> <#> I wouldn't have thought of it <#> But no child nobody in the scheme thought that Santa came by chimney<S1A-074$B> <#> <[1> <unclear> 5 words </unclear> </[1> </{1><S1A-074$C> <#> <[2> Baby Jesus <#> I see </[2> </{2><S1A-074$B> <#> Hard to believe Phil said to me <,> he says this evening five weeks it 'll be Christmas Eve no Christmas Day he said <#> I must say I hadn't realised <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear><S1A-074$A> <#> Well I haven't even thought <{> <[> about doing anything </[><S1A-074$B> <#> <[> And all the work </[> </{> that 's got to be done before Christmas<S1A-074$C> <#> I suppose you haven't been in town lately so you haven't seen the Christmas <{> <[> decorations </[><S1A-074$B> <#> <[> No </[> </{><S1A-074$A> <#> No bar yesterday <,> now was the nearest I 've been in you know<S1A-074$C> <#> But I mean the decorations have been there for the last few weeks<S1A-074$A> <#> Mmm <,,> <#> What did Jimmy say to you this morning<S1A-074$B> <#> He was very conciliatory <{> <[> actually </[><S1A-074$A> <#> <[> Had they </[> </{> spotted you before you knocked<S1A-074$B> <#> No I put in the letter before I went out <#> I thought it was better to continue<S1A-074$A> <#> Mm <#> Aisling <&> calling </&><S1A-074$B> <#> So I said in the letter I got the biro from you<S1A-074$C> <#> Mm<S1A-074$B> <#> So I wrote the letter and put in the thing cos I knew they they usually take a late Sunday morning<S1A-074$C> <#> Mmm<S1A-074$B> <#> They 're Donnybrookers in that sense<S1A-074$A> <#> Mmm<S1A-074$B> <#> So<S1A-074$A> <#> <.> Anoth </.> Another track coming at me now yeah yeah<S1A-074$B> <#> I put in the letter in the<S1A-074$A> <#> Letterbox<S1A-074$B> <#> Letterbox <#> So I said I 'd call in on my way back <#> So Aisling said she 'd like to come in as well<S1A-074$A> <#> Mm <#> Had they found the letter by the time you actually<S1A-074$B> <#> No actually<S1A-074$A> <#> They were still in bed then<S1A-074$B> <#> But it was twelve o'clock and they usually go to half twelve Mass so I thought I was safe enough on ringing the bell <{> <[> at that stage </[> but I wasn't <#> Nell came out in her dressing gown <,> and your man came out in his bare feet putting on his clothes<S1A-074$A> <#> <[> Mm mm </[> </{><S1A-074$A> <#> Mm<S1A-074$B> <#> So I look and I 'm sorry to disturb you <#> Really I I didn't earlier I put in a letter but <,> I didn't want to disturb you <,> but I says we 've a bit of a problem <#> I explained how then <,> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> to come out and see it so <#> And he came out in his toes you know<S1A-074$A> <#> Yeah yes<S1A-074$B> <#> But <,> my only unease about it I thought that they 'd take it fairly well but my only unease was in case he 's keeping these Austin Cambridges as kind of <,> period items for resale you know<S1A-074$A> <#> Mm mm mm<S1A-074$B> <#> Albeit they wouldn't be very usable but<S1A-074$C> <#> Don't like the look of it <&> laughter </&><S1A-074$B> <#> Well <,> some people have this <,> fetish for cars <#> But <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <,> he said the right thing to Aisling <#> Ah he says for God 's sake don't worry about that and so on <#> He says it 's a good job it wasn't a crash into a car that there was somebody in it<S1A-074$C> <#> Yeah<S1A-074$B> <#> He said and he hoped nothing worse happens to her in her driving career <#> You know he he did very well<S1A-074$A> <#> Mm mm<S1A-074$B> <#> So in a sense I was glad she was there <#> On the other hand I was a bit nervous of her being there in case he got cross<S1A-074$A> <#> Yes yeah yeah<S1A-074$B> <#> Cos it would hit her you know <#> So uh I told him and I showed Jimmy but I says <,> it is a nuisance and he apologised about it <#> So I was happy <#> And we will repay all the cost <,> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> But it 's not that<S1A-074$A> <#> She got quite a land alright <#> She came up to me <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> and I was asleep <#> And she was asking she <.> sa </.> I don't know what she said to me and I turned and I looked at her and I said what did you say <#> And she said it again <#> So I sat up in the bed and I looked at her and I knew it was awfully serious to look at the face <#> And I said Aisling what 's wrong <#> I don't know what you 're talking about <#> And then she said it again <,> <#> Cos she didn't say anything about a car or having been out <#> Uh she hit Jimmy is I thought what she said you see you know so <{> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[><S1A-074$B> <#> <[> That 's </[> </{> probably what she did say<S1A-074$A> <#> Yeah <#> But uh she sat down on the bed then and she was <,> not quite shaking but not <{> <[> do you know yeah </[> quite shocked<S1A-074$C> <#> <[> Shocked </[> </{> mm<S1A-074$A> <#> So she went over to Edel then in the afternoon <#> And Edel crashed her car <#> <{> <[> Totalled </[><S1A-074$C> <#> <[> She totalled </[> </{> her mother 's car<S1A-074$A> <#> <.> He </.> her mother 's car was a total write-off <,> about a month after Louise got her full <.> dr </.> driving licence<S1A-074$B> <#> She went into the back of a car and totalled it <#> You know well I mean if you think the best type of accident to have at this stage <#> You know <{> <[> a car with no-one in it </[><S1A-074$A> <#> <[> It 'll make her careful <#> It 'll make her careful </[> </{> <#> She admits that she was coming out you see <,> that car <,> moves very <,> the wheel on that you can do an awful lot of things with it that you can't do with mine and she was coming out just that little bit fast and didn't turn the wheel <{> <[> fast enough </[> <#> Where my car 's so slow in the off take <,> that it 'd be less likely to happen you know<S1A-074$B> <#> <[> Mmm that 's right </[> </{><S1A-074$B> <#> Well I I probably was foolish in that but anyhow but I just thought if she <,> it would give her the feeling if she could take it from the door and do normal driving and come back <,> when 'tis quiet on a Sunday morning<S1A-074$A> <#> Mmm <#> Ah and you did the right thing certainly <,> cos she didn't want to go and you called <{> <[> her again </[> and she says oh no no <#> I said Aisling if you don't go now you 'll never go again <#> Go on <,,><S1A-074$B> <#> <[> No no </[> </{><S1A-074$C> <#> When did Trisha ring<S1A-074$A> <#> She rang during the week this <{> <[> Tuesday or Thursday </[><S1A-074$C> <#> <[> Oh did she <#> I wasn't talking to her </[> </{><S1A-074$B> <#> I wasn't talking to her at all <#> No I don't think she rang during the week<S1A-074$A> <#> She did ring during the week <#> I uh I told you what night she rang<S1A-074$B> <#> I heard she rang but<S1A-074$A> <#> Yeah it was it was <.> du </.> it was a day uh weekday<S1A-074$B> <#> That was a good while ago<S1A-074$A> <#> Ah it was during last week sometime <#> I wrote to her on Tuesday <#> It was Tuesday night I think she rang<S1A-074$C> <#> It must 've been<S1A-074$B> <#> I 'd say it was probably Tuesday night alright<S1A-074$A> <#> And I had actually written to her that day<S1A-074$C> <#> It would 've been the Wednesday probably because it was the night that I wasn't in<S1A-074$A> <#> Okay it was probably Wednesday <#> <{> <[> It might have been Wednesday </[><S1A-074$C> <#> <[> <unclear> 3 words </unclear> </[> </{><S1A-074$B> <#> Ah she won't ring tonight so<S1A-074$C> <#> I know <#> I don't think she 'll ring tonight <unclear> 1 word </unclear><S1A-074$A> <#> Next Saturday she 'll ring she won't she 'll probably just ring to say when she 's coming I mean<S1A-074$B> <#> Oh that 's five or six weeks away <#> Not at all<S1A-074$C> <#> No <,> 'tisn't <#> It 's only three <#> Oh no it 's more <#> You 're right<S1A-074$B> <#> About four weeks <#> It 'll be nice for her coming home for her first Christmas <{> <[> like that then </[> <,> <#> I always think it is<S1A-074$A> <#> <[> Mm mm mm </[> </{><S1A-074$C> <#> It 's going to be you know the way you normally see on the news all those returning <{1> <[1> returning </[1> emigrants and everything <#> And now it can you 'll be the parents of a returning emigrant and you 'll be <{2> <[2> weeping when she 's going again </[2><S1A-074$B> <#> <[1> Yeah yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-074$A> <#> <[2> Dublin airport 's always </[2> </{2> very nice for those <{> <[> things </[><S1A-074$C> <#> <[> Christmas 's </[> </{> lovely there<S1A-074$A> <#> Yeah yeah <#> They always have lots of light and<S1A-074$C> <#> And they 've really gone up-market now with those snowmen
