There 's thirteen it 's he would rather have one with low miles lower miles <#> But it 's not too bad<S1A-093$A> <#> Well that would be a big <.> gro </.> step up for me <,> even<S1A-093$B> <#> Why

wasn't a split link chain<S1A-093$B> <#> I didn't think it would be<S1A-093$A> <#> Well I that 's what I asked for<S1A-093$B> <#> So did you not get it done then<S1A-093$A> <#> Uhm <,> well he hammered out the links right<S1A-093$B> <#> It 's a rough job actually <#> I done that before<S1A-093$A> <#> He no I watched him do it <#> He did it very very professionally <#> He knows exactly what he 's at like you <{1> <[1> know </[1> <#> He used to race bikes like <#> He <{2> <[2> said he 'd be </[2> doing working on chains every <,> every week like <#> And uh he said he 'd he 'd have it
