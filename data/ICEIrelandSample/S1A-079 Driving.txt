<S1A-079 Driving><I><S1A-079$A> <#> Did you drive<S1A-079$B> <#> I didn't no <#> I 'm still finding driving very hard to be honest with you <#> I drove we were going out to dinner the other night <,> and uhm <,> I was driving fine <,> but the the car is old and the gears are very hard to change anyhow <#> And I can't park at all because <,> I can't put that <{> <[> amount </[> of effort into my hand <#> And uh <,> I just couldn't we arrived down we were going for dinner uhm <,> in a wee place down off George 's Street <#> And 'twas fairly busy and there was a perfect parking space and all I had to do was reverse into it and I couldn't get into reverse <#> I had to stop in the middle of George 's Street get out of the car <,> let Daniel move over to the driving seat <&> laughter </&><S1A-079$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-079$A> <#> And park it<S1A-079$B> <#> With the entire naturally enough when they saw a woman <{1> <[1> driving </[1> the entire <,> population sitting behind me in the car is going berserk <#> Like I mean you could 've parked a truck <,> <{2> <[2> in </[2> this space but I just couldn't manage the <{3> <[3> the </[3> gear change <#> So <,> I 'm not really kind of taking the car out <{4> <[4> that much </[4> <#> He had to drive home then as well <#> I I kind of find that that pulling on it <,> is just too sore<S1A-079$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-079$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-079$A> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1A-079$A> <#> <[4> Yeah </[4> </{4><S1A-079$A> <#> Yeah Mam hurt her hand <#> She fell over a caddy car <#> She was golfing <#> Don't ask <&> laughter </&> <#> I am telling you it was so embarrassing<S1A-079$B> <#> Not big enough for her <{> <[> yeah </[><S1A-079$C> <#> <[> Tall </[> </{> woman <&> laughter </&><S1A-079$A> <#> She is tiny <#> But anyway she fell over and she couldn't change the gears in the car but she had to drive <#> So she 'd take Padraig <,> and she 'd go okay I 'm pressing the clutch and he had to change them <{> <[> for her </[><S1A-079$B> <#> <[> When </[> </{> we were coming down uhm town that 's what I was <{1> <[1> doing </[1> <#> And I was going <,> press the clutch <unclear> 1 word </unclear> <{2> <[2> and he cos he </[2> wouldn't be familiar with uh <,> gearshift <{3> <[3> anyhow </[3> because <,> <{4> <[4> he 'd normally </[4> drive automatic <#> And I 'm there going first <#> That 's not first <&> laughter </&><S1A-079$A> <#> <[1> Right </[1> </{1><S1A-079$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-079$A> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1A-079$A> <#> <[4> <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> </[4> </{4><S1A-079$A> <#> Yeah<S1A-079$B> <#> And the gears is going <&> screech </&><S1A-079$A> <#> Yeah<S1A-079$B> <#> And I 'm going no no no <#> This is not working at <{> <[> all </[> <#> So in the end it was easier for him to drive<S1A-079$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-079$A> <#> Yeah or else you 're here trying to steer with your left and reach your right the whole way <{> <[> over here </[><S1A-079$B> <#> <[> Oh yeah <,> yeah </[> </{> which doesn't <,> it 's uh driving 's not it 's not that bad now but <,> I can't park unless I 'm just driving into a big long space which very often in town you 're not going to find something <{1> <[1> you can glide into </[1> <#> And I definitely cannot put it into reverse <#> My hand just I if I can just get my right hand over <#> But I 've not got a lot of power in my <{2> <[2> right hand </[2> <#> I 've to get my right hand over and try and put the car in reverse <&> laughter </&> <#> When I thought about it though oh God out in the middle <{3> <[3> of George 's Street </[3> <#> I was mortified <#> I really was embarrassed <#> And then I was saying that to you we were walking up George 's Street on Friday <,> uhm <,> I met Daniel after college and and we were just walking back up uhm to Rathmines <#> We were coming up George 's Street and it was <,> after five <#> Like it was a busy time <#> And uh this motor bike came flying out from the middle of I do not know where right underneath a car<S1A-079$D> <#> <[1> Definitely not yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-079$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-079$A> <#> <[3> George 's Street yeah </[3> </{3><S1A-079$A> <#> Oh was he alright<S1A-079$B> <#> He wasn't actually <#> He wasn't too good at all <#> But the poor girl driving the car was in <{> <[> bits <#> Oh she was </[> absolutely <#> I felt I mean I know it was terrible for him but I felt so sorry for her<S1A-079$A> <#> <[> Bits <#> Oh Jesus </[> </{><S1A-079$A> <#> Yeah at least it had happened to him<S1A-079$B> <#> Yeah she <{> <[> was just </[><S1A-079$A> <#> <[> That 's not </[> </{> some consolation to <{> <[> her </[><S1A-079$D> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-079$B> <#> There was nothing anybody could 've done <#> It was very <,> it was wet and oily and it had been raining <#> It had been that Friday it had been absolutely lashing and it was very wet <#> And <,> the two of them were kind of travelling <,> but even if they hadn't been <,> you know <,> it wouldn't 've really mattered <#> He just went <,> he just came directly right under her car <#> He came off the bike <#> The bike hit the car <,> and he came right under her wheels<S1A-079$C> <#> Oh man<S1A-079$A> <#> I know<S1A-079$B> <#> And me being mega cool of course <,> <&> laughter </&> <#> I 'm there going <,> oh God oh God <#> And I 'm there I 'm kind of <,> hanging onto Daniel and then I 'm going right right <,> <#> I 'm a nurse <&> laughter </&> <#> Right <,> we 're going over to have a look <#> Right <#> Are are we ready <&> laughter </&> <#> You 'd swear I was going in to perform surgery <&> laughter </&><S1A-079$A> <#> And he 's there <,> am I ready am I ready <{> <[> and we 're not ready <#> We 're </[> not ready <#> You 're not ready <#> I can see you 're not ready<S1A-079$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-079$B> <#> Oh God <,> <#> I felt such an eejit <#> Thought about <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <#> But it 's just <,> it wasn't even that I didn't really see him go under at all I just heard it<S1A-079$A> <#> Mm<S1A-079$B> <#> And it was the most horrific sound <#> But I think he had so much he had all he had all the gear on all the leather <,> stuff on <,> so I think that probably saved him <,> quite a lot of damage obviously <#> He he was <,> sort of conscious <#> He wasn't really conscious <#> I 'd say he was fine you know <#> I 'd say he was <#> It was a bit horrific now<S1A-079$A> <#> It was very scary<S1A-079$B> <#> Oh yeah <#> You can't imagine I mean she was <,> she was so hysterical <#> She really was <#> I felt really sorry for her <#> You know and she was kind of there going she <,> you know saying there was nothing I could do <#> And there <{> <[> wasn't </[> anything she could do <#> But still like I felt sorry for her<S1A-079$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-079$A> <#> Sure you know like if a dog runs out in front of you <#> <{1> <[1> And </[1> you run <,> you know the way dogs come at the side of the car and they just go under <{2> <[2> your back wheel </[2> <,> and you can't do anything about and the dog is dead <#> And you 're here like going but I couldn't do anything <#> And you feel <{3> <[3> so bad </[3><S1A-079$B> <#> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1><S1A-079$B> <#> <[2> Yeah oh yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-079$B> <#> <[3> You feel <,> I you 've murdered </[3> </{3> something<S1A-079$A> <#> Yeah<S1A-079$C> <#> Mm<S1A-079$B> <#> We were coming up the road <#> I was bringing my mother up <#> She wanted to get wallpaper or something a couple of weeks ago <#> And I was driving up <,> the main road <&> laughter </&> a fairly busy road and this dog was crossing it <#> Now the dog would 've had time to dance across the road never mind walk across it <#> My mother <.> s </.> <,> eventually spotted it <#> I had spotted him from way back but she hadn't spotted it until much much later <#> She grabs my arm <&> laughter </&> on the gear like <#> I had my <,> hand sitting on top of <{> <[> the gear </[> stick <#> She grabs my arm and pulls it <&> laughter </&> <#> Now my <,> my gear arm was kind of over on my mother 's lap <#> And I 'm would you let go <&> laughter </&> <#> I see it <#> It 's fine <#> And she 's here going nearly cutting the circulation off going <,> oh God <#> Easy to know she 'd never been a driver like <#> Oh dear God <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear><S1A-079$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-079$C> <#> Right <#> You 've put me off driving now<S1A-079$B> <#> Ah no driving 's grand<S1A-079$C> <#> Right <#> It 's very nerve-wracking<S1A-079$B> <#> Ah you get used to it <#> I remember when I was <,> like when I was learning how to drive and kind of coming through town and uh <,> traffic lights of course were the big you know boo-boo <#> And I 'm there and I 'd see these traffic lights <,> you know kind of down at the end of the road and they 'd be green <&> laughter </&> and of course I 'd speed up<S1A-079$A> <#> Yeah <&> laughter </&><S1A-079$B> <#> I didn't want to have to stop cos then the car was going to conk out <#> So you 'd come haring up to these traffic lights at a ridiculous speed and then they 'd change and then you 've to hit <&> claps hands </&> the brakes <&> laughter </&> <#> And nearly kill the poor devil that 's beside you <#> So we were coming up to these traffic lights <#> My brother was teaching me how to drive <#> And we were coming up <,> those the traffic lights were red so I had to stop anyhow <#> There was a car in front of me <#> And Tadhg goes <,> now I 'm coming up I had intentions of stopping obviously this car was stopped in front of me <,> and Tadhg goes Ais hit the brakes <#> And I was kind of thinking oh I 'll hit them in a minute <,> <#> And he goes Ais hit the brakes <,> Ais <#> And I was still driving on <&> laughter </&> <#> Hit the fucking brakes <&> laughter </&> <#> And of course then I lammed on the brakes <,> went into floods of tears got out of the car <,> in the middle of the street in town going I 'm not driving any more <&> laughter </&> being the kind of calm female that I am <#> We arrived home anyhow <#> He drove home <,> neither of us speaking to each other of course <#> And uhm we we were both still living at home at the time <,> and that was the end of that <#> My mother says no way <.> y </.> either one of ye move out of the house <,> or you stop teaching <.> t </.> her how to drive because it was just causing such <#> Oh 'tis impossible I think when a member of your family<S1A-079$D> <#> <{> <[> Yeah </[> my dad used to get so mad<S1A-079$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-079$D> <#> Yeah <#> Oh <,> I wouldn't talk to him and he wouldn't talk to me <#> And I 'd be going back to Dublin <unclear> 1 word </unclear> in <{> <[> floods of tears </[> <#> 'Twasn't that bad like<S1A-079$B> <#> <[> Are you serious </[> </{><S1A-079$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-079$D> <#> <{> <[> Forgotten now </[><S1A-079$B> <#> <[> And what and he </[> </{> used to kind of yell at you or that<S1A-079$D> <#> Yeah <#> And it was <,> the the brake <{> <[> thing </[> <#> I usen't to drive I used to drive on the main road on Sunday morning <#> There was no cars<S1A-079$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-079$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-079$D> <#> If a car was like <,> twenty-five hundred yards in front of me <,> I used to slow down <,> and pull into the side like <&> laughter </&> <#> I 'd be afraid I 'd bash into it <#> If one came up if one passed me out I 'd go <#> I 'd <.> near </.> nearly be in the field beside you know <#> Oh I used to get I still get hysterical but <,> I don't drive very often <{> <[> either <unclear> 3 words </unclear> </[><S1A-079$B> <#> <[> I don't think it 's a good </[> </{> idea to let a member of your family teach you<S1A-079$C> <#> Especially a male member<S1A-079$A> <#> Unless well my Dad taught me and then my mother took over <#> But I think it 's different for me <#> I used to drive from Newmarket to Ballybunion which is a good forty miles<S1A-079$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-079$A> <#> I 'd just get in the car in Newmarket and they 'd tell me I had to go to Ballybunion<S1A-079$B> <#> Mm<S1A-079$A> <#> And in fact it 's such a it 's a desperate road now <#> It 's the worst road possible <#> It 's all windy wind <,> <&> laughter </&> <#> Windy winds <,> windy bends <#> It 's really bad <#> So there isn't an opportunity to get out of the car and let somebody take over <#> So you 're <{> <[> stuck there </[> <#> You have to drive it <,> and you 've to cross the main roads <#> I remember I used to hate that <#> I used to be so scared<S1A-079$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-079$B> <#> Coming from a kind of by-road <{> <[> onto a </[><S1A-079$A> <#> <[> Yeah yeah </[> </{> coming from a by-road onto a main road <#> <{1> <[1> You cross it </[1> <#> And you 'd like you go on the main road for about like that much and then you 've to cross off it <,> and it 's a blind bend <#> I still hate that <{2> <[2> blind bend </[2> <,> <#> I mean as my mother goes you go up to it <#> You look as best as you can and you put your foot down and you go<S1A-079$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-079$B> <#> <[2> Oh God yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-079$B> <#> Yeah like what can you do<S1A-079$A> <#> Oh yeah <#> I mean people have got killed on that bend so much <#> Put your foot down and go <#> But I think that was how I learned <#> She just made me <{> <[> drive </[> <#> Even at they used make me drive a lot on my own <,> which I used to hate doing <#> You know when you 're you 're provisional and you 're not allowed<S1A-079$B> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><S1A-079$B> <#> Mm<S1A-079$A> <#> But I remember they used make me drive on my own <,> up and down the town <#> And we 're always sent for parts everywhere cos like Dad has a garage <#> Say he 'd send me off to Charleville like for windscreens and bumpers and <&> laughter <&> shit like that <#> And I 'd be here like driving away like <#> Hello I 'm from Philip Garavan 's <#> Looking for a back bumper there please <&> laughter </&> <#> Who the hell is this <#> He still does it <#> He sends me off for a windscreen <#> He sent me for a windscreen to Charleville <#> And I went into this man <#> Hello I 'm looking for Fergus <#> He was painting <#> I didn't presume he was Fergus <#> He was painting the wall <#> Looking for Fergus <#> And he goes yeah <#> And I just went where 's Fergus <&> laughter </&> <#> I am Fergus <#> I I beg your pardon <#> I 'm from Philip Garavan 's and I 'm looking for a windscreen <#> Can you point it out <#> He put it in the car right in such a way <,> I was like driving and the car the windscreen was coming that way but if it slipped it was going to cut my jugular <#> That 's all I could think of the whole way home <#> And it 's a really bad road <#> Cos he told me <,> drive down <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> go on <#> You 'll be fine <,> but when you 're coming home make sure you go slow and don't break it</I>
