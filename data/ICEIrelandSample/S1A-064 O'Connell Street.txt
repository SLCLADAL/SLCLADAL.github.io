was saying something about <,> well you know at least at least it 's so cool like you know when you 're driving round Dublin <,> doing your driving test you know <,> you needn't ever go any faster than thirty-five miles an hour <#> You know when like when you 've got all these tractors and all I suppose on the road at home and I was there going <,> oh yeah there 's tractors on all the roads <&>

in a field out the back you know there 's cows watching I had to kind of steer around them<S1A-064$B> <#> More like the cows were like the bollards<S1A-064$G> <#> But weren't you rubbing it in<S1A-064$E> <#> Oh my Lord <#> And Sharon was saying <,> well the hardest thing I suppose was learning to drive you know in the middle of a field <&> laughter </&> <#> Your woman couldn't believe

much uh </[><S1A-064$E> <#> <[> I 'm not surprised </[> </{><S1A-064$A> <#> There 's something about a flat in Rathmines<S1A-064$E> <#> You should listen to the words <#> They 're something else <#> He goes <,> like <,> he met her like <,> he says he 's coming in off the boat <{> <[> and he tells her <unclear> 3 syllables </unclear> </[> go to England<S1A-064$B> <#> <[> Oh yeah sure she was

just laugh at it <#> But I thought the funniest line ever <{> <[> was </[><S1A-064$B> <#> <[> Well sure she was laughing </[> </{><S1A-064$A> <#> She was laughing at it yeah<S1A-064$E> <#> Was she<S1A-064$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-064$E> <#> But the funniest line I think in the whole thing is when he goes uhm <,> she stops him anyway and he says <,> ah go away <#> Oh would you go away from bothering me from bothering me you know <#> It would be more in your line now to give me a spin into town in the squad like and this kind of thing <&> laughter </&> <#> And then he goes <,> they were going off someplace anyway uhm but you and your oul pioneer pin and your <&Irish> fa/inne </&Irish> <,> and your little white cross for not cursing <&> laughter </&><S1A-064$A> <#> Is that on it too<S1A-064$E> <#> Yeah <#> Oh it 's wicked <,> and he goes uhm<S1A-064$C> <#> But is it about the Rose of Tralee<S1A-064$E> <#> Yeah <{> <[> well he means </[><S1A-064$D> <#> <[> Well he 's having a dig </[> at the Rose of Tralee and having a dig at the guards<S1A-064$X> <#> <[> He 's having a dig at The Rose of Tralee </[> </{><S1A-064$E> <#> Yeah<S1A-064$D> <#> And Brenda Hyland happened to fit the slot<S1A-064$B> <#> It just so happens that she fitted it you know <#> <{> <[> She was </[><S1A-064$C> <#> <[> Well I swear to God </[> </{> she 's the most popular Rose of Tralee that ever came out of there<S1A-064$B> <#> She is isn't she<S1A-064$E> <#> She is <#> But and then he says to her that <,> anyway in the end anyway they go and they find the early houses in Dublin cos he 's come in off the boat from England <,> and uhm she says <,> will we go for a pint and <,> no he says <,> we 'll go for a pint and she says <,> oh no I can't drink while I 'm on duty <#> I 'll have a brandy and a port <,> and he goes <,> by Jesus <,> he says <,> 'twas like throwing water into a barrel of sawdust<S1A-064$C> <#> Is this the words <,> the words of the song<S1A-064$E> <#> The words of the song <#> It 's thirteen minutes long<S1A-064$D> <#> It 's <.> hu </.> <#> It 's some length of a song<S1A-064$A> <#> I never really heard it<S1A-064$B> <#> Yeah well it 's supposed it 's supposed to be comic <#> That was that was the spirit <,> anyhow when they discussed it one morning on the radio there <{> <[> that was it </[><S1A-064$D> <#> <[> Yeah Ma/ire </[> </{> said Eugene 's going through a Christy Moore phase at the moment and he sat her down to listen to this song for thirteen minutes<S1A-064$E> <#> But the words are brilliant like <#> And he goes <,> in them in them days he says <,> you you 'd get a pound for doing a funeral at Newbridge and two pound for a wedding <,> and a kick in the arse if you hadn't enough wine in the chalice <&> laughter </&> <#> This is like the words of it <#> And he breaks into verses of Ave Maria and everything in the middle of it <#> Did you hear it Shane<S1A-064$F> <#> No<S1A-064$B> <#> It 's a wonder Shane hasn't heard it<S1A-064$E> <#> It 's a wonder you haven't heard it<S1A-064$G> <#> Remember the night when we went to see him <#> Where was it we went to see him <#> Uhm<S1A-064$B> <#>
