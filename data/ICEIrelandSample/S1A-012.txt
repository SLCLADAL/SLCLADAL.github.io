</{1><S1A-012$A> <#> <[2> Mhm </[2> </{2><S1A-012$A> <#> <[3> Aye </[3> </{3><S1A-012$A> <#> Oh did it<S1A-012$B> <#> Mhm<S1A-012$A> <#> What bit<S1A-012$B> <#> Och just a wee <,> it must be a <,> solo <#> Uh there was a a fella and a girl on the stage <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <{> <[> you </[> know<S1A-012$A> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{><S1A-012$A> <#> A guy with black hair<S1A-012$B> <#> Aye<S1A-012$A> <#> And she 'd blonde hair<S1A-012$B> <#> Mhm<S1A-012$A> <#> Aye that was the two lead<S1A-012$B> <#> That <{> <[> was </[> just all it showed you know<S1A-012$A> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{><S1A-012$A> <#> He was <,> he was very good <,> the fella who played the lead <#> The the Danny you know like the John Travolta part <#> <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> I can't even remember his name <#> Uhm <,> and like the uh they were all very good but the best you know the acting wasn't that good but you see the singing and dancing was great <#> You know all <#> And there was <.> c </.> a a woman who did <,> she was the choreographer but she also did this part where they go to a dance you <{1> <[1> see </[1> <#> And there 's this girl comes in from another school and wins a dance competition and she was <,> she did the dancing <{2> <[2> herself </[2> God she was brilliant <,> you know they were doing jiving and all this <#> She was brilliant <#> And like even the dancers she had the whole lot of them doing it and it was some size of a cast <#> I 'd say it <{3> <[3> was </[3> easy fifty or sixty people you know<S1A-012$B> <#> <[1> Mhm </[1> </{1><S1A-012$B> <#> <[2> Mhm </[2> </{2><S1A-012$B> <#> <[3> Mhm </[3> </{3><S1A-012$B> <#> Well were there any in the music society your music society <{> <[> in it </[><S1A-012$A> <#> <[> Margaret Bartlett </[> </{> was in it and then big Jonathan <{1> <[1> Kirwin </[1> <#> He was one of the <.> ma </.> the the gang you know the male fellas <,> <#> But uh it was wild funny he came out at one point dressed for the dance you know they 've this high school dance and he 'd like a red blazer with black trim on it and all <#> He looked like a waiter <&> laughter </&> <#> If you 'd seen him this wee thin red tie you know <#> But as I say like in between the acting and all you couldn't hear the girls at all you know <#> But uhm it was wild funny because they had all this like <,> a scenery of you know a just a brick wall <,> but every time somebody wanted to go off left of the stage they just walked through the wall <#> There was this like bit of the wall opened up you know <&> laughter </&> <#> Well I thought Gerald was going to die laughing <#> And then they 'd wheel a car on in through the wall you know <{2> <[2> that sort of </[2> way <#> You know it was wild funny <#> And then during one bit uhm <,> they maybe don't have the lights you know to do it right but probably what they meant to do was black out most of the stage and keep the lights on the front where these girls were talking so that the boys behind could clear the stage <{3> <[3> but </[3> you could still see them perfectly <#> And they were chatting away in the middle of this scene and these boys just walked on lifted a table and walked back off again you <{4> <[4> know </[4> <#> But uhm <,> and what and the band and all was brilliant you know the band <{5> <[5> was really good </[5><S1A-012$B> <#> <[1> Oh aye </[1> </{1><S1A-012$B> <#> <[2> Mm mhm </[2> </{2><S1A-012$B> <#> <[3> Mhm </[3> </{3><S1A-012$B> <#> <[4> Yeah </[4> </{4><S1A-012$B> <#> <[5> Mm </[5> </{5> <#> It 's funny that show that they did in the Riverside that put me completely <{> <[> off that show forever <#> It was awful </[><S1A-012$A> <#> <[> Och it was dreadful <#> Sure they were only weans </[> </{> <#> That was wild <#> Desperate <#> But it just shows you the interest that show has <#> We were saying you know <,> God if Portrush ever did it I mean they would have no problem getting young people <,> no problem at all <#> Because I mean it it shows you the interest when you look at the audiences you know<S1A-012$B> <#> Aye<S1A-012$A> <#> But uh and then we came out we went <&> yawn </&> next door into the Linenhall for a drink <#> And then we ended up we went over to the Strand Road and went into the Strand Tavern <#> No we were going to go into <,> the Carrick <,> the bar <,> and we looked beside and the Strand Tavern 's beside it and there was a queue coming out the door so we thought oh we 'll go in there <#> So it was a disco and all <{> <[> <#> So </[> we went in there and stayed to the death of it <#> So I was in here <,> I came back in about two o'clock<S1A-012$B> <#> <[> Oh right </[> </{><S1A-012$B> <#> I never heard a sound and I went to bed <{> <[> after </[> half twelve <,> and I heard nothing after that<S1A-012$A> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><S1A-012$A> <#> Oh we just got in we were walking <,> it was packed sure that tiny wee place you know the upstairs the disco bit <#> We were trying to sort of get from the front door over to the dance floor you know <,> and I felt this tap on the shoulder <#> Who was it but Jerry Jarvis <,> you know from <{1> <[1> the course the journalism course </[1> <#> And uhm I was saying to him about Charlie sending down the bit of him in the Derry Journal and then seeing <{2> <[2> his by-line and all in it </[2> this week so<S1A-012$B> <#> <[1> Oh yes uh-huh uh-huh </[1> </{1><S1A-012$B> <#> <[2> Uh-huh uh-huh </[2> </{2><S1A-012$B> <#> Is he <{> <[> still </[> working with the Derry Journal<S1A-012$A> <#> <[> And then </[> </{><S1A-012$A> <#> Oh aye he only started in June you see <#> That was it <#> He was the boy who was in Cookstown <{> <[> do you remember </[><S1A-012$B> <#> <[> I know </[> </{> mhm<S1A-012$A> <#> So uhm I was <.> just <.> chat </.> chatting to him for a wee while <#> And then we were up dancing and I looked down and who did I see <#> I thought God <.> tho </.> those two are wild familiar looking <,> these two fellas standing <#> Who was it <#> Desmond and Donagh Byrne <,> standing <{1> <[1> <#> I saw </[1> them two <#> But it was absolutely packed <#> And funny we parked uhm do you know when you go down the Strand Road to <,> what do they call it Rock Mills you know the <{2> <[2> house </[2> the students ' residence <{3> <[3> the </[3> halls of residence and you go up left <{4> <[4> <#> It 's not up the Rock Road <#> I don't know </[4> what what it is <#> It 's up right up the side of Andy <{5> <[5> Cole 's bar there </[5> <#> And I would always if we 're down there I would always park up near the houses in there <#> We were coming back down the hill and the police there was about six policemen at the bottom of the hill all out with their guns and all and one of them was sitting noting down all this stuff <#> I don't know what he was writing whether it was the cars or whatever you know<S1A-012$B> <#> <[1> Oh right mhm </[1> </{1><S1A-012$B> <#> <[2> Uh-huh </[2> </{2><S1A-012$B> <#> <[3> Uh-huh </[3> </{3><S1A-012$B> <#> <[4> The side of the road up there or something </[4> </{4><S1A-012$B> <#> <[5> Mhm mhm </[5> </{5><S1A-012$B> <#> Aye<S1A-012$A> <#> Because I was saying it was funny we came over the bridge last night and <{> <[> nobody <#> Not a one </[> <#> You know the way you could never come over that bridge without being stopped<S1A-012$B> <#> <[> Not searched you mhm </[> </{><S1A-012$B> <#> That 's right<S1A-012$A> <#> But it was good enough good craic you know and <,> <#> Like we were sitting any time there was a bit of music we were sitting clapping away and like everybody starts clapping along to the music <{> <[> you </[> know <#> It was good craic<S1A-012$B> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{><S1A-012$B> <#> Well you 'll have to let Donagh know how it went now<S1A-012$A> <#> Oh that 's right <#> But he said he was talking to Jonathan now so<S1A-012$B> <#> Oh right<S1A-012$A> <#> And uh <,> what else <#> And there 's a <,> Derry 's wine and cheese party 's on next Saturday <{1> <[1> <#> So </[1> Jane has tickets to sell but I says I don't know how I got out of that for I got sent raffle tickets but they didn't send me <{2> <[2> tickets for the <,> so I have to buy </[2> <,> because they 've to be in for that <{3> <[3> Saturday </[3> so we 're all going to go to that next <{4> <[4> Saturday </[4><S1A-012$B> <#> <[1> Oh </[1> </{1><S1A-012$B> <#> <[2> Why is she doing it <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[2> </{2><S1A-012$B> <#> <[3> Uh-huh </[3> </{3><S1A-012$B> <#> <[4> Mm where </[4> </{4> is that <#> The White <{> <[> Horse </[><S1A-012$A> <#> <[> The </[> </{> White Horse <#> But uhm Jane and Geoffrey and them were up <,> well Geoffrey was up a couple of years ago when he did a Derry show <,> and they were saying like it 's really nice <#> They have like it 's not just wine and cheese they have wine but they have you know <{1> <[1> a buffet and then </[1> they 've a band and all <#> They have they take over like a suite just for themselves so <#> I didn't think it would be all that <#> I thought it was just standing about <{2> <[2> like </[2> with a glass of wine in your hand making chit-chat you know <#> So we 'll definitely have to sort out <,> even if you buy a book and I buy a book <{3> <[3> that </[3> would do rightly<S1A-012$B> <#> <[1> Uh-huh </[1> </{1><S1A-012$B> <#> <[2> Uh-huh </[2> </{2><S1A-012$B> <#> <[3> Mm </[3> </{3><S1A-012$B> <#> And uh it would probably be more of your music society now would go to that <,> <{> <[> maybe sure Jerry <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[><S1A-012$A> <#> <[> I would think <,> aye I don't know now if they 'd go or not </[> </{> <#> Mm <#> But as I say that 's a a car full we have now <{> <[> anyway so </[> and Tyrone 's going to drive next week so<S1A-012$B> <#> <[> Uh-huh </[> </{><S1A-012$B> <#> Very good<S1A-012$A> <#> I think that 's <,> that sorted out <#> But it <,> there 's some crowd in Derry you know on a night out like that <{1> <[1> <#> You </[1> know you think a lot of people come into Portrush <,> til you see that place just <.> ma </.> <#> I mean that 's before even places empty <{2> <[2> you </[2> know say about two o'clock or whatever time everybody comes out or half one <#> It 's some crowd of people<S1A-012$B> <#> <[1> Uh-huh </[1> </{1><S1A-012$B> <#> <[2> Aye uh-huh </[2> </{2><S1A-012$B> <#> Well there 's probably as many coming if you were around here when they 're all spilling out too <{1> <[1> about half one </[1> and two <{2> <[2> o'clock you know </[2><S1A-012$A> <#> <[1> I suppose aye </[1> </{1><S1A-012$A> <#> <[2> Maybe it 's </[2> </{2> just they all wander about that much <{1> <[1> it doesn't </[1> seem like it you know <#> It was that funny we just saw this queue and went up and said wonder what 's on here you know <#> We says to these boys at the end of the queue look what 's everybody <#> They says oh there 's a disco <#> And we were saying well it must be good for nobody 's queuing in anywhere else you <{2> <[2> know </[2> <&> laughter </&> <#> So we just decided to go in there <#> And the fella that was playing in the Teen Angel you know he 's sort of like the <.> Fr </.> the the Frankie Valli type of character you know <#> He is a boy called John Doherty <&> DAW HER TEE </&> or Doherty <&> DOUGH HER TEE </&> uhm from Highland Radio <{3> <[3> <,> and you see him on the ad </[3> for the Richmond Centre<S1A-012$B> <#> <[1> Aye </[1> </{1><S1A-012$B> <#> <[2> Mhm </[2> </{2><S1A-012$B> <#> <[3> Oh yes mhm </[3> </{3><S1A-012$B> <#> He was in the Derry Journal <#> <{> <[> Mhm </[><S1A-012$A> <#> <[> Aye </[> </{> <#> You know the ad for the Richmond <{> <[> Centre </[> that 's is usually on at Christmas <#> He 's in it <#> So he he just took like one song to sing <#> And if you 'd seen the boy was doing what Donagh would 've been doing <&> laughter </&><S1A-012$B> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><S1A-012$B> <#> Was it awful<S1A-012$A> <#> Ah <#> Well he didn't sing that much so I began to think maybe that they took some songs off him because he Donagh had was supposed to be doing five so I began to think maybe your man wasn't very good cos it <.> ge </.> he didn't do five songs <{1> <[1> <#> One </[1> was from the like like the high school kids came in and did it <#> But if you 'd seen him <,> he was about five foot and a wee round weeble man you know <,> and this short black hair and these shades on him you know <#> If you 'd seen him <&> laughter </&> <#> Such a difference <&> laughter </&> <#> <{2> <[2> Of course </[2> I know <#> You couldn't imagine it <#> Honest to God <#> But as I say he was <.> ca </.> only he only came in for the high school dance <#> He was meant to be like the star who came and sang a few songs <{3> <[3> you know <,> </[3> <#> But as I say he didn't sing very much<S1A-012$B> <#> <[1> Donagh 's very good </[1> </{1><S1A-012$B> <#> <[2> Complete opposite </[2> </{2><S1A-012$B> <#> <[3> Oh aye uh-huh uh-huh </[3> </{3><S1A-012$B> <#> Well maybe <,> they were left in the lurch <#> Sure they might 've been<S1A-012$A> <#> Aye<S1A-012$B> <#> Couldn't do anything else<S1A-012$A> <#> But I mean their costumes and all were nice and</I>
