simultaneous and unclear speech </&><S1A-006$A> <#> I was about to make the bloody dessert and took out the bar of chocolate to make it with which I thought was two hundred and fifty grams <#> Now we 're talking a big bar of chocolate <{1> <[1> here </[1> <#> I actually didn't even check it <#> I just thought <,> well I mean <{2> <[2> there 's </[2> not going to be any more chocolate in it than that<S1A-006$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-006$B> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-006$D> <#> But how could you not have checked it <#> I mean how could could you have thought that you you knew what<S1A-006$A> <#> I don't know <#> I mean it was just a <{> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> yeah yeah </[><S1A-006$B> <#> <[> I can understand that <#> You take that bar and you think you 'd be very used to looking at it </[> </{> and you just imagine that two hundred and fifty grams is probably like a half of it or <{1> <[1> something </[1> as opposed <{2> <[2> to you know </[2><S1A-006$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1><S1A-006$C> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-006$A> <#> <[2> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[2> </{2> <#> You know one of the big bars of chocolate out of

sorry<S1A-006$A> <#> Well I thought well there 's not going to be <unclear> several sylls </unclear> one of those big <#> <{1> <[1> I mean </[1> there 's not going to be any more chocolate in it than <{2> <[2> that </[2> <#> So of course took it out to do the recipe and looked at the recipe and it said two hundred and fifty grams and it was only one hundred and fifty grams <{3> <[3> <#> So </[3> I had to run down to Iceland which all sounds very well but it actually takes twelve minutes to get there and twelve minutes to get back again <#> And when you 're on a very very bloody <{4> <[4> tight

</&><S1A-006$A> <#> <{> <[> Twenty-four minutes later I was forty-five minutes over </[><S1A-006$C> <#> <[> What what time <,> what time did you </[> </{> what time did you have everybody over

from nine <{1> <[1> o 'clock </[1> uhm and went to half ten <{2> <[2> Mass </[2> and then I walked <,> I walked well ended up walking back from Mass<S1A-006$C> <#> <[1> Oh right </[1> </{1><S1A-006$C> <#> <[2> Uh-huh </[2> </{2><S1A-006$D> <#> Uh-huh <,> <#> Well that was<S1A-006$A> <#> Uh-huh<S1A-006$D> <#> Really silly<S1A-006$A> <#> No buses <{1> <[1> <#> And I </[1> phoned

let you go through the whole spiel and then they say sorry love we 're fully booked<S1A-006$D> <#> <[1> Why <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[1> </{1><S1A-006$D> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-006$?> <#> <[3> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[3> </{3><S1A-006$B> <#> Why were they booked on a Sunday at half ten<S1A-006$A> <#> Apparently it 's <{> <[> Mother 's Day </[><S1A-006$B> <#> <[> Oh it 's Mother 's Day </[> </{> Yeah <{> <[> I suppose </[> people are going out and<S1A-006$C> <#> <[> Oh right </[> </{><S1A-006$A> <#> So uhm <,> so that was fine but I 'd already bloody well walked for fifty-five minutes to an hour so I wasn't really best pleased at having to walk down again and then back up again <#> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> And I was on a very tight <{> <[> schedule at this stage </[><S1A-006$D> <#> <[> Could you not just have </[> </{> stayed smaller <,> you know reduced everything a bit <#> <{> <[> Uh well by half </[><S1A-006$A> <#> <[> I didn't know </[> </{> whether<&> Simultaneous and unclear speech </&><S1A-006$A> <#> So then of course Seamus arrived over at a quarter past two <#> And I opened the door and I was like do you know you 're really early<S1A-006$D> <#> Lovely yeah<S1A-006$A> <#> And he said yeah <#> I said that 's okay as long as you know cos I haven't hoovered or anything yet <#> So he came in and that was grand <#> And uhm <,> why did I start to tell you this<S1A-006$C> <#> I thought you <{> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[> <#> You were asking about wine <,> and I said you asked me what <,> did I want wine or something like that<S1A-006$?> <#> <[> Making this story up as usual </[> </{><S1A-006$A> <#> Yeah well so when I went down to Iceland <&> laughter </&> I then thought I 'll buy a big bottle of blackberry and raspberry water for Mary because she 's pregnant <&> laughter </&> <#> It occurred to me ten minutes ago <{1> <[1> that actually </[1> <,> she had Charles you know <{2> <[2> ten months ago now </[2> <#> I mean that 's why I bought it <,> for pregnant Mary<S1A-006$B> <#> <[1> Are you serious </[1> </{1><S1A-006$B> <#> <[2> Oh my God that 's <.> hilar </.> </[2> </{2> <&> laughter </&><S1A-006$B> <&> laughter </&> <#> That 's absolutely hilarious<S1A-006$D> <#> Not for Jessie who might be driving<S1A-006$A> <#> No no no for pregnant Mary <#> No I actually think that 's a bit scary<&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><S1A-006$B> <#> But it 's funny the way you can like remember things from you know <,> <{> <[> the way </[> it just sticks in you head like that <#> You just obviously you associate her with being<S1A-006$A> <#> <[> Uh-huh </[> </{><S1A-006$A> <#> Aye with being pregnant<S1A-006$B> <#> Pregnant or not drinking or something you know<S1A-006$A> <#> It I mean it only occurred to me cos then I was thinking uh <,> about five minutes ago I was thinking oh right okay well Mary 's coming round and I wonder what time Charles 'll go to bed at and that <,> <#> And then I thought yes because she 's had the baby now <#> I 'm <{> <[> seriously concerned now </[><S1A-006$B> <#> <[> That 's hilarious </[> </{> <#> Och your house is just so gorgeous now <#> You must be just so happy here <#> It 's really lovely<S1A-006$A> <#> Och I am <#> I mean I do I really like it now I must say<S1A-006$B> <#> Och it 's really really beautiful<&> unclear speech </&><S1A-006$C> <#> Well to be honest I think it 's fine <#> You know it 's not<S1A-006$A> <#> Greg absolutely loves that clock<S1A-006$C> <#> Cos it 's not <,> I think that those uhm <,> it 's fine you know it 's not about it it 's not what you would choose <{> <[> yourself </[> but at the same time it 's not that it absolutely stands out<S1A-006$D> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-006$A> <#> But I don't think that it 's in keeping with <{> <[> the rest of </[> the room<S1A-006$B> <#> <[> Serious </[> </{><S1A-006$D> <#> It 's what you find in like a great-auntie 's house or something like<S1A-006$A> <#> Yeah <#> I I laughed the other day girls <#> Aunt Janice came to get the delivery of this sofa and I came back in again and this <,> was like this <,> and this <,> was like this<S1A-006$B> <#> Oh really<S1A-006$A> <#> And everything was angled <&> laughter </&> <#> She had gone round the house and angled everything<S1A-006$B> <#> Oh my God<S1A-006$A> <#> And I was <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <,> cos I have to <,> I mean like that would drive me mad because it 's actually not quite<S1A-006$C> <#> Straight<S1A-006$A> <#> It 's not quite straight <#> It 's not like I 'm Little Miss Tidy or anything but I don't like things angled <#> And she 'd gone round and she 'd re-arranged the bottles in the bathroom <#> <{1> <[1> And she 'd angled <,> she 'd angled </[1> something in the kitchen and <,> and you get uhm you see uhm uh something was angled in the kitchen <{2> <[2> you know tonight after she 'd left </[2> <#> Oh just re-arranged like where they where they were like just where they were sitting <{3> <[3> <#> She </[3> wanted them more central<S1A-006$B> <#> <[1> Are you serious <#> Oh my God that 's she just did </[1> </{1><S1A-006$D> <#> <[2> What do you mean re-arranged the bottles </[2> </{2><S1A-006$D> <#> <[3> Oh right </[3> </{3><S1A-006$D> <#> Mhm<S1A-006$A> <#> I mean I had two of them sort of over to the side and she wanted them more central than that so I had to go back round the house de-angling <{> <[> them <#> It was just it was so funny </[><S1A-006$D> <#> <[> Oh that 's hilarious <#> That 's so funny </[> </{> <#> And she obviously thought she was like with the delivery people as well because she was afraid of them marking your wall<S1A-006$A> <#> No but that was great <{> <[> because </[><S1A-006$D> <#> <[> I know </[> </{> <#> That 's what I 'm saying<S1A-006$A> <#> You know if Rowena had been here <,> not that I mean no harm to Rowena but she probably would have been a bit like me it wouldn't have occurred to her probably<S1A-006$C> <#> Yeah cos it wouldn't actually occur to you I think <{> <[> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[><S1A-006$A> <#> <[> No well </[> </{> it would occur to me now after because the last time <,> when they brought in the first sofa they actually did scrape it along the <{1> <[1> wall </[1> <#> And I can see where the scrape <{2> <[2> it isn't it it 's it 's marked the paint but </[2> it 's not<S1A-006$C> <#> <[1> Oh right </[1> </{1><S1A-006$B> <#> <[2> Yeah has marked the paint <,> yeah yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-006$B> <#> Yeah it just has yeah <#> Mary-Louise that 's an absolutely gorgeous photograph of you two <#> Absolutely beautiful<S1A-006$A> <#> Mhm <#> I like that one<S1A-006$B> <#> It 's beautiful of both of you <#> Whose wedding was that at<S1A-006$A> <#> I think that was at Colin and Susan 's wedding<S1A-006$C> <#> Yeah cos you were you were wearing that outfit<S1A-006$A> <#> Yeah<&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><S1A-006$B> <#> Here I think this is really weird <#> Was I telling somebody this last night in the pub <#> Tom O'Donnell was on the phone the other day <{1> <[1> and he said </[1> I think this is really weird <#> I got an invitation to Gene White 's <{2> <[2> wedding </[2><S1A-006$D> <#> <[1> Yes you were telling me </[1> </{1><S1A-006$C> <#> <[2> Tom </[2> </{2> did<S1A-006$B> <#> Tom O'Donnell did <#> That was so weird <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> <#> No I said actually no we didn't <#> I mean <,> the truth we 're going to be away not that Gene would have known that because you could send somebody an invitation and<&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><S1A-006$B> <#> On the other hand we you know we didn't invite Gene to our wedding and there 's a little bit of that as well <#> You know there is that bit of you 're not invited to somebody 's wedding you don't invite them to yours you know <#> No but I think there 's a bit of <,> there 's a bit more of that than you might <{1> <[1> <,> expect actually </[1> <#> And that 's and that 's I mean truly honest to God <{2> <[2> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[2> <,> after all we didn't invite him and we would have been in Australia anyway <#> But I thought that was really weird actually that out of the blue <{3> <[3> they </[3> suddenly invited Tom O'Donnell<S1A-006$D> <#> <[1> Well maybe yeah </[1> </{><S1A-006$C> <#> <[2> You were going to Australia </[2> </{2><S1A-006$C> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1A-006$C> <#> And is Tom going<S1A-006$A> <#> What I think 's weird about that<S1A-006$B> <#> I think so yeah<S1A-006$A> <#> What I think 's weird about that is that okay he invited Tom which is a bit strange <,> but Tom was on the stag <,> but so was Roger<S1A-006$C> <#> Yeah<S1A-006$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-006$A> <#> You know I find that odd<S1A-006$C> <#> Yeah <{> <[> so do I </[><S1A-006$D> <#> <[> Did he <,> so </[> </{> unless the invitation <,> it was before the stag was it <#> Uhm so Gene might have heard on the stag<&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><S1A-006$A> <#> But Tom Tom was Tom not absolutely amazed to be invited on the stag<S1A-006$C> <#> <{> <[> Yeah he was </[><S1A-006$B> <#> <[> I think I think </[> </{> he was pretty amazed <#> But uhm I think that a lot of Tom I mean I think a lot of the reason Roger was invited on the stag was probably cos he knew Dublin as well <#> <{> <[> I mean </[> I think that was a large part of it <#> I think Tom was invited because just for<S1A-006$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[><S1A-006$C> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{><S1A-006$C> <#> Apparently he was in the Morning Star on Christmas Eve<S1A-006$B> <#> Probably <,> so they were all chatting about it and Tom and as I say Roger and Donall and you know <#> But I think that that 's really weird<S1A-006$C> <#> Isn't it<S1A-006$B> <#> But they should have a lovely day <#> Having said that I 'm sure it 'll be a really great day now <#> Easter Monday is a nice day to book for a wedding you know<S1A-006$C> <#> Och it 's a pity you 're not<S1A-006$B> <#> I know it is a pity actually <#> I would like to be there <#> Was that your door or was that the settee<S1A-006$A> <#> <{> <[> See if my settee was making those </[> kind of noises it 'd be going back<S1A-006$C> <#> <[> Well unless maybe you have an invitation and it just hasn't arrived </[> </{><&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><S1A-006$C> <#> Doreen do you have that shirt in pink<S1A-006$B> <#> Uh yeah <{1> <[1> actually </[1> it 's my mum 's shirt <#> <{2> <[2> I bought </[2> it for her uhm and I just thought I 'd wear it<S1A-006$C> <#> <[1> It 's beautiful </[1> </{1><S1A-006$C> <#> <[2> It 's absolutely gorgeous </[2> </{2><S1A-006$C> <#> It 's lovely <#> Uhm unless maybe they have and it just haven't arrived<S1A-006$B> <#> I don't I don't think so <#> I don't actually think because he probably <,> <#> Uhm really I 'm only saying this to you and obviously I 'm not offended or anything <#> I just thought it was odd<&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><S1A-006$E> <#> We then came home and spent <,> I went up to bed <,> and he spent about an hour on the internet trying to book a holiday or something just so that he could kind of say the next day you know <&> laughter </&> <#> Then he set his alarm for half six <{> <[> cos he was going to get up </[> and go out but his alarm woke Charles<S1A-006$C> <#> <[> Oh Jesus </[> </{><S1A-006$C> <#> Oh no<S1A-006$B> <#> Oh no<S1A-006$E> <#> So then he was up <#> So then he couldn't <{> <[> you </[> know he couldn't sort of leave so it was a disaster<S1A-006$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-006$B> <#> Oh God <#> Disaster<S1A-006$C> <#> But he cos I cos when he said last night then I was saying I was thinking och no maybe he has something organised cos he was saying aw you know<S1A-006$E> <#> I knew he didn't but<S1A-006$C> <#> All in hand girls all in<S1A-006$E> <#> I I can sort of understand because I kept forgetting <{> <[> <,> myself that </[> it was anything to do with me you know<S1A-006$C> <#> <[> Yeah yeah </[> </{><&> unclear speech </&><S1A-006$B> <#> But <,> were off with your mum and dad and everything today were you<S1A-006$E> <#> Yes we were up <,> uhm we went to the Drumnagrey<S1A-006$B> <#> Oh right<&> unclear speech </&><S1A-006$B> <#>
