<S1A-013 Student chat 2><I><S1A-013$A> <#> There 's a shop on the Dublin Road called Natural Interiors and we keep driving by but we haven't been in it yet <#> Uh we wanted <,> <{> <[> we don't </[> like those curtains<S1A-013$B> <#> <[> Oh yes Natural Interiors </[> </{><S1A-013$B> <#> Beside the Ulster Bank<S1A-013$A> <#> Yeah that 's it <#> We don't like those curtains and we actually whenever the curtains are down that 's a really nice area you know just that bay with the <{1> <[1> window and all </[1> <#> So we thought well we don't really want that covered up <,> but we need a bit of privacy so we thought we 'd actually get a screen you know like a standing <{2> <[2> screen </[2> and just in the evening whenever we 're in here put the screen up<S1A-013$B> <#> <[1> Uh-huh </[1> </{1><S1A-013$B> <#> <[2> Mhm </[2> </{2><S1A-013$B> <#> Or you could <{1> <[1> just get uhm </[1> <,> curtains that when you pull them back they go right back <#> Means like <{2> <[2> during the day </[2><S1A-013$A> <#> <[1> And get the <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[1> </{1><S1A-013$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> aye but it 's still you know I sort of <.> li </.> <,> I 'd want the <{> <[> view </[><S1A-013$C> <#> <[> Martina 's </[> </{> just anti-curtains<S1A-013$A> <#> Yeah <#> I I 'm not an <{> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[><S1A-013$B> <#> <[> But your window might not be exactly </[> </{> the same <,> if you get that done again it might not be the same shape<S1A-013$A> <#> What<S1A-013$B> <#> You know if you get your bay done again <{1> <[1> it </[1> mightn't be exactly the same <#> <{2> <[2> Like when </[2> we got ours done it wasn't the same angle<S1A-013$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-013$A> <#> <[2> <.> Wh </.> </[2> </{2><S1A-013$C> <#> How can you get the bay done <#> How can you <{> <[> get the bay done </[><S1A-013$B> <#> <[> Did you get your windows done </[> </{><S1A-013$A> <#> No <{> <[> our </[><S1A-013$B> <#> <[> Have </[> </{> you to get your windows done <,> sometime<S1A-013$A> <#> I don't yes but I don't know how much it would affect the whole wood there <#> I don't want rid of that wood really <,> you know round the <{> <[> frame </[><S1A-013$B> <#> <[> I was thinking </[> </{> that 's what they did in our house <#> Took all the wood away<S1A-013$A> <#> Did they<S1A-013$B> <#> We had a big you know all the <,> nineteen twenties stuff <,> big thick <{> <[> uh frames </[><S1A-013$C> <#> <[> and replaced them with what </[> </{><S1A-013$B> <#> They 're the ones <{> <[> that your <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> </[> <#> And they were alright for about sixty years<S1A-013$A> <#> <[> Just modern frames </[> </{><S1A-013$A> <#> Mm <#> Oh I don't know <#> What do you <,> well see we thought about getting just a screen <#> You know the way you could use it in other parts of the house as well or <{1> <[1> but </[1> we never found one <#> But just <,> we keep driving by this <{2> <[2> place </[2> you know and they they 've got the the best screens in the window because they 're just plain wooden frames with like a white gauze on them <{3> <[3> <#> You know </[3> so they would let in as much light as possible but <,> it would still give you that wee bit of privacy <#> You know maybe like us sitting here in the evening time you know we don't want people gawping in<S1A-013$B> <#> <[1> Right </[1> </{1><S1A-013$B> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-013$B> <#> <[3> Mhm </[3> </{3><S1A-013$B> <#> You know like uhm <,> like those Japanese things like those with the black and the white <{> <[> squares </[><S1A-013$C> <#> <[> We saw them </[> </{> yes but they were <,> how much were they<S1A-013$A> <#> They were about seven hundred pounds <{1> <[1> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[1> <#> This was a laugh <#> You should have seen us <#> We went into do you know that Tom Washington on <{2> <[2> Washington </[2> Place <{3> <[3> is it </[3> <#> No it 's not Tom <,> Tom Rothwell 's place <{4> <[4> on </[4> Washington Place <,> just to get some different ideas of what to do with windows <#> We hadn't decided on the screen at this stage <#> We just wanted to look at what like a designy sort of person would have <#> And oh my God I was <{5> <[5> mortified </[5> <#> Saw all this money and your wee man came round and started talking about the design of our house you know sort of <#> And uh he was talking about being up in <,> what was it he was saying about<S1A-013$B> <#> <[1> What </[1> </{1><S1A-013$B> <#> <[2> Mhm </[2> </{2><S1A-013$B> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1A-013$B> <#> <[4> Yes </[4> </{4><S1A-013$B> <#> <[5> Mhm </[5> </{5><S1A-013$C> <#> Can't remember but he said <,> oh we 've just done <,> we 've we 've we 've actually just done a house <#> Uh I can show you some photographs of that <#> And he showed us uh <,> I mean the room <,> the one of the downstairs rooms was the size of the downstairs floor basically <&> laughter </&><S1A-013$A> <#> Yeah it was a like a country mansion set in its own grounds and everything <#> I was just sort of well well this is just uh <,> what period is the house you know <#> And I said well it was built nineteen ten <&> laughter </&> <#> What 's wrong with you <#> It 's a it 's a it 's a terrace just off Sunnydale Street you know <&> laughter </&> <#> Do you know them <#> He said well what size is the bay <,> you know and I sort of said like wall size or something like that <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> Oh it was awful <#> I was so mortified<S1A-013$C> <#> I don't think there was any reason to be <{1> <[1> <#> The only </[1> reason we were embarrassed was that we couldn't <{2> <[2> have afforded anything that he suggested </[2><S1A-013$A> <#> <[1> I know </[1> </{1><S1A-013$A> <#> <[2> We knew we didn't have any </[2> </{2> money <{> <[> at all </[><S1A-013$B> <#> <[> There 's never anybody </[> </{> in there <#> I didn't think that shop was still open<S1A-013$A> <#> Well they they do all their business over the phone it seems cos your man Tom Rothwell was just sitting there in a big plush chair you know <{> <[> Oh yes yes yes </[> yes yes yes we can yeah five thousand yes yes<S1A-013$B> <#> <[> Was he actually there </[> </{><S1A-013$C> <#> On the way out there were a couple in <,> looking for a wall-hanging <{> <[> <#> I mean </[> I think that one there was twenty-nine pounds reduced from something <,> something roughly the same size <#> So he was saying to the couple uh <,> yes well this one might be more in your range <#> It 's only two to three thousand<S1A-013$A> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{><S1A-013$A> <#> Yeah <,> I know<S1A-013$B> <#> You 're joking<S1A-013$A> <#> Yeah well I mean he 's <,> we sort of Ted had actually had this idea cos he saw these screens you know and I mean that white screen was lovely <#> It was really you know the one with wee squares in it <#> And I said God that 's an idea <#> I never thought of that <#> So we were uh walking round anyway and we saw these other screens downstairs <#> And we sort of <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> that these were the Japanese screens at about seven hundred pounds or whatever <,> but they were very very heavily decorated <#> I would have preferred something a bit more plain <#> So I saw these ones in the corner <,> and they were beautiful <#> It was like sort of <,> just like a thin cast-iron frame <,> with <{1> <[1> a wee sort of </[1> bobbly thing like <#> And there was fabric stretched from one end to the other <,> you know so there was gaps in it <#> And it was really really lovely just plain <,> nice lines in it <#> I said so what about those ones <#> And he said they were fifteen hundred to two <{2> <[2> thousand </[2><S1A-013$B> <#> <[1> Iron </[1> </{1><S1A-013$B> <#> <[2> Oh they were </[2> </{2> expensive too<S1A-013$A> <#> And I said my <,> I said what what <&> laughter </&> <#> And he said it 's because of what <,> well apparently it 's Japanese or Chinese silk or something that the actual material is <{1> <[1> you know and that 's why it 's <,> </[1> so expensive <#> Yeah <{2> <[2> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[2><S1A-013$C> <#> <[1> Aye the frame wasn't expensive </[1><S1A-013$B> <#> <[1> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> and all </[1> </{1><S1A-013$B> <#> <[2> Well I think </[2> </{2> uhm <,> Spoils had them before <#> They 're wood and paper<S1A-013$A> <#> Well we went <{> <[> those Spoils </[> but they only had you know the sort of the the pine stuff the like the the wickerwork <#> And they were charging about sixty pounds for this very shabby-looking wicker type thing<S1A-013$B> <#> <[> Castle Court </[> </{><S1A-013$B> <#> As much as that<S1A-013$A> <#> Yeah <#> I just didn't think it was nice at all <#> But you see that sort of thing just the plain wooden <{1> <[1> frame </[1> with uhm thin material <,> like gauze or something <{2> <[2> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[2> <#> Yeah I mean <{3> <[3> I have seen </[3><S1A-013$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-013$B> <#> <[2> It works out cheaper </[2> </{2><S1A-013$B> <#> <[3> I 've </[3> </{3> seen them somewhere <#> I think it was Spoils <#> Mine was <{> <[> nice </[> as well<S1A-013$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-013$A> <#> Well you see that <{1> <[1> Natural Interiors </[1> place it looks as if it 's got some oul rubbish in it cos they have those big <{2> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[2> </{2> <#> The Natural Interiors on the Dublin Road<S1A-013$B> <#> <[1> They 're nice </[1> </{1><S1A-013$B> <#> <[2> Where </[2> </{2><S1A-013$B> <#> I never noticed that<S1A-013$A> <#> Yeah well they <unclear> several sylls </unclear> as well<S1A-013$B> <#> They 've nice stuff though<S1A-013$A> <#> Yeah they do <#> They do <#> Maria had sort of done <,> oh she 's done all the sort of hanging <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> stuff and that wickerwork stuff round the house you know <#> <{> <[> It 's very nice </[><S1A-013$B> <#> <[> Tying stuff </[> </{> with <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> 's always a bit <{> <[> strange like </[><S1A-013$A> <#> <[> Mm mhm </[> </{><S1A-013$C> <#> What about the fireplace <#> What do you think of that<S1A-013$A> <#> Not really<S1A-013$B> <#> Well <,> I mean I really like this kind of <{> <[> thing </[> <#> But I mean <,> like what do you want <#> I mean there 's <,> you can have it a big high one<S1A-013$A> <#> <[> No </[><S1A-013$C> <#> <[> No we don't </[> </{><S1A-013$A> <#> Uh-huh <#> Do you know what I <{> <[> want </[><S1A-013$B> <#> <[> Like </[> </{> that line <,> see that line on the <{> <[> wall </[> <#> That could have been the top of the original one<S1A-013$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-013$A> <#> Yeah <#> <{> <[> No that 's </[> the damp-proof course<S1A-013$C> <#> <[> Do you think so </[> </{><S1A-013$B> <#> Like you know when <,> whenever these houses were built <{1> <[1> I 'm sure </[1> they were the same as in <{2> <[2> our house they </[2> used to be you know ones you could actually walk under<S1A-013$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-013$A> <#> <[2> I know </[2> </{2><S1A-013$C> <#> Uh-huh<S1A-013$A> <#> Oh God as big <{> <[> as that </[><S1A-013$C> <#> <[> A priest hole </[> </{> might have been<S1A-013$B> <#> Could 've been <&> laughter </&><S1A-013$A> <#> But do you know what I would like to do <#> I 'd like to just take the whole thing away <#> And obviously you 'd need a hearth just for fire purposes but uhm <,> just have a hole-in-the-wall fire <,> do you know and just <{1> <[1> have for an old fireplace <#> And then we 'd just even have </[1> wee <,> no <,> no just nothing <#> It 's just miss <{2> <[2> frame </[2> here and that 's your fire<S1A-013$B> <#> <[1> Oh that 'd be great yes <,> <#> All in brick </[1> </{1><S1A-013$B> <#> <[2> Uh-huh </[2> </{2><S1A-013$C> <#> Are you not going to need to have something on the floor<S1A-013$A> <#> That 's what I 'm saying you 'd need a hearth for fire purposes or <{> <[> some <,> some wee </[> <,> what do you call them stencils about it or something<S1A-013$B> <#> <[> As long as there 's something <,> some <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[> </{><S1A-013$B> <#> And <.> ha </.> you just <,> if you just had like uhm <,> <{> <[> brick </[> the whole thing brick and actually the brick coming out you could use it as like <#> I think it actually went away down and in had the TV and all<S1A-013$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-013$A> <#> Well I 'm thinking what <{> <[> else we could do </[> <#> Yeah I know<S1A-013$B> <#> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[> </{><S1A-013$B> <#> Even just for that wee bit the brick with the wee <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> on it<&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><S1A-013$B> <#> You 're coming down Sunnydale Street <,> on your left-hand side <,> it 's not that far down <#> <{1> <[1> And </[1> it 's about the only house that has those kind of curtains <{2> <[2> back and it 's </[2><S1A-013$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-013$C> <#> <[2> Is it Deramore Avenue </[2> </{2> or Sunnydale Street<S1A-013$A> <#> <{> <[> Sunnydale Street </[><S1A-013$B> <#> <[> Sunnydale Street </[> </{> <#> And the bricks are like going right up to the ceiling and it 's all white and bookshelves <{> <[> and there 's a big <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[><S1A-013$A> <#> <[> Yeah uh <#> Actually now I 'd even be tempted </[> </{> just to paint that <,> to give it a plain colour <{> <[> cos </[><S1A-013$B> <#> <[> You could </[> </{> sell that fireplace <#> They are worth a fortune<S1A-013$A> <#> You 're serious<S1A-013$B> <#> Well see when they took ours out <,> and we didn't get any money for them <{1> <[1> <,> the </[1> Housing Executive took them out <#> And like uh <,> well the one in the parlour <{2> <[2> <,> that </[2> was very old <#> That was a really nice one <#> It was a bit sort of Art Nouveau and they <{3> <[3> took it </[3> <#> That would 've been a

but that that that whole thing 's <{> <[> the fireplace <,> </[> <#> Or just the<S1A-013$B> <#> <[> That would uhm </[> </{><S1A-013$A> <#> Don't know <,> to be honest with you</I>
