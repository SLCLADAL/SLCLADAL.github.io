**Time**: 5pm Brisbane, 9am Berlin

**Zoom link**: https://uqz.zoom.us/j/6388735320 

**Abstract**

Shana Poplack has set benchmarks for the development of corpora since the early 1980s. Poplack (2015, p. 921) maintains that the “gold standard remains the (standard sociolinguistic-style) ... corpus”. The aim of producing corpora using these principles is to avoid the ‘cherry picking’ approach which dominates much of the theoretical literature. Poplack and her team have created the Ottawa-Hull Corpus which consists of 3.5 million words of informal speech data. This corpus is enormous and beyond the capabilities of a single linguist in a small language community. This talk offers suggestions for corpus development in the field that follow Poplack’s principles, but also shows where compromises can be made. I discuss the method developed during the Gurindji Kriol project called ‘peer elicitation’. It supplements Poplack’s gold standard of naturally occurring speech with semi-formal elicitation to ensure sufficient data for quantitative analyses. </summary>

**Abstract**

This talk introduces the Text Crunching Centre (TCC) which is a Computational Linguistics and Digital Humanities service hosted at the University of Zurich, and a collaboration partner of LADAL. We present a selection of our case studies using text analytics, from cognitive linguistics, social, political and historical studies. We show how stylistics, document classification, topic modelling, conceptual maps, distributional semantics and eye-tracking can offer new perspectives. Our case studies include language and age, learner language, the history of medicine, democratisation, religion, and attitudes to migration. We conclude with an outlook to the future of text analytics.</summary>

<summary>**Corpus-based media linguistics: A case study of linguistic diversity in Australian television**

```{r redfern, echo=FALSE, out.width= "25%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/redfern.jpg")
```

In this *golden age of Indigenous television* [@sebbens2020golden], it is important to analyze Indigenous-authored drama series, so that we can move beyond ‘a deficit perspective’ [@charity2020racial, 216] in relation to mediated linguistic diversity. This talk presents a corpus linguistic case study of Australian Aboriginal English (AAE) lexis as present in three such Indigenous-authored television series: *Redfern Now*, *Cleverman*, and *Mystery Road*. For television viewers, mediated AAE can be an important source of information, especially if they do not regularly interact with Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people. This would be the case for many Australians, and even more so for international viewers of Australian television series. All three analyzed series were exported overseas and thus have both Australian and international audiences. Using lexical profiling analysis (AntWordProfiler; @anthony2013antword) in combination with qualitative concordance analysis, the talk identifies and compares the use of AAE lexis across the three series. Analysis of frequency and distribution will pinpoint words that appear to be particularly significant lexical resources in mediated AAE. The talk will be framed through the notion of diversity, as conceptualised in relation to television series. </summary>

<summary>**Data-driven learning for younger learners: Boosting schoolgirls’ knowledge of passive voice constructions for STEM education**</summary>


```{r peter, echo=FALSE, out.width= "40%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/peter.jpg")
``` 


**Abstract**

This paper explores how corpus technology and DDL pedagogy can support secondary schoolgirls’ reporting of an observed science experiment through a written research report, focusing particularly on how corpora were used to develop receptive and productive knowledge of passive voice constructions. A pre-test of the grammaticality of passive constructions was conducted, alongside a diagnostic pre-instruction written report requiring the retelling of an observed science experiment were collected from 60 Year 9-10 girls at a high school in Australia. During a full 10-week term, students were given guided individual homework tasks and short in-class pair/group DDL activities focusing on passive voice constructions, using freely available online corpus applications such as SketchEngine. Following this treatment, a post-test was conducted while an additional written research report was collected. Questionnaire and interview data was also collected to determine the perceptions of younger female learners and their teachers regarding their engagement with corpora and DDL for improving knowledge and use of passive constructions over time. The data suggest the DDL treatment resulted in increased knowledge of the grammaticality of passive voice constructions, while students were more likely to include such constructions in their written reports while increasing the accuracy of their use. Qualitative stakeholder perceptions of improved disciplinary linguistic knowledge, increased data management skills, and positive engagement with “science” were also found in the survey/interview data, although a number of challenges at the technical and conceptual levels for DDL still remain.

<summary>**Strategic targeting of rich inflectional morphology for linguistic analysis and L2 acquisition**</summary>

```{r laura, echo=FALSE, out.width= "30%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/laura.png")
``` 

**Abstract**

Many languages have rich inflectional morphology signaling grammatical categories such as case, number, tense, etc. Rich morphology presents a challenge for L2 learners because even a basic vocabulary of a few thousand words can entail mastery of over 100,000 word forms. However, only a handful of the potential forms of a given word occur frequently, while the remainder are rare. Access to digital corpora makes it possible to determine which forms of any given word are of highest frequency, as well as what grammatical and collocational contexts motivate those few frequent forms, facilitating strategically focused language learning tools. Corpus analysis of the frequency distributions of inflectional forms provide linguists with added insights into the function of languages. The results achieved primarily by using correspondence analysis of Russian material are potentially portable to any language with rich inflectional morphology.


**About Laura**

In the Cold War era, Laura Janda combined study of Slavic linguistics at Princeton and UCLA with US-government-funded adventures as an exchange student behind the Iron Curtain in countries that have since changed their names: USSR, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.

<summary>**Text classification for automatic detection of hate speech, counter speech, and protest events**</summary>

```{r gregor, echo=FALSE, out.width= "40%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/people_gregor.jpg")
``` 

**Abstract**

Social sciences have opened up to text mining, i.e., a set of methods to automatically identify semantic structures in large document collections. However, the methods have often been limited to a statistical analysis of textual data, strongly limiting the scope of possible research questions. The more complex concepts central to the social sciences such as arguments, frames, narratives and claims still are mainly studied using manual content analyses in which the knowledge needed to apply a category (i.e. to “code”) is verbally described in a codebook and implicit in the coder’s own background knowledge. Supervised machine learning provides an approach to scale-up this coding process to large datasets. Recent advantages in neural network-based natural language processing allow for pretraining language models that can transfer semantic knowledge from unsupervised text collections to specific automatic coding problems. With deep learning models such as BERT automatic coding of context-sensitive semantics with substantially lowered efforts in training data generation comes within reach to content analysis. The talk will introduce to the applied usage of these technologies along with two interdisciplinary research projects studying hate speech and counter speech in German Facebook postings, and information extraction for the analysis of the coverage of protest events in local news media.


**About Gregor**

Dr. Gregor Wiedemann is working as Senior Researcher Computational Social Science at the Leibniz Institute for Media Research │ Hans Bredow Institute (HBI). Since September 2020, he heads the Media Research Methods Lab (MRML).

**Abstract**

RMarkdown (along with Jupyter Notebooks) is a unified authoring framework that allows one to combine code, figures, and text into a single document. It is increasingly becoming a default way for researchers in the computational sciences to share their work, as all the materials necessary to reproduce the analysis can be found in a single document.

This workshop will explore how RMarkdown can be used for writing academic papers (instead of tutorials or blog posts). It will assume no previous knowledge, other than a basic familiarity with R. During the workshop, participants will learn:

The fundamentals of RMarkdown, including what it is, how it works, and its basic syntax
Options for displaying, hiding, and executing code 
Options for including tables and graphs
Options for including citations and cross-references

<summary>**MuPADRF (*Multifactorial Prediction and Deviation Analysis Using Regression/Random Forests*)**


**Abstract**

```{r opening, echo=FALSE, out.width= "45%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/STG.jpg")
```

In this talk, Stefan gave a brief and relatively practical introduction to an approach called MuPDAR(F) (for *Multifactorial Prediction and Deviation Analysis using Regressions/Random Forests*) that he developed (see @gries2014using, @gries2014subject for the first applications). The main part of the talk involved using a version of the data in @gries2014subject to exemplify how this protocol works and how it can be done in R. Second, Stefan discussed a few recent extensions proposed in  @gries2020theresmore and  @griestamupdar, which have to do with 

(i) how to deal with situations with more than two linguistic choices, 

(ii) how predictions are made, and

(iii) how deviations are quantified. 

Finally, he briefly comment on exploring individual variation among the target speakers (based on @gries2021examining).
